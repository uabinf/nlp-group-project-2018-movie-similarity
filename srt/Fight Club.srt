1
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,422
<i>People always ask me
if I know Tyler Durden.</i>

2
00:02:02,825 --> 00:02:04,264
Three minutes.

3
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,700
This is it. Ground zero.

4
00:02:07,304 --> 00:02:09,260
Want to say a few words for the occasion?

5
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,662
<i>With a gun barrel between your teeth,
you speak only in vowels.</i>

6
00:02:13,749 --> 00:02:15,341
I can't think of anything.

7
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:19,426
<i>For a second, I forget about
Tyler's controlled demolition thing</i>

8
00:02:19,503 --> 00:02:21,546
<i>and I wonder how clean that gun is.</i>

9
00:02:21,622 --> 00:02:23,502
It's getting exciting now.

10
00:02:23,588 --> 00:02:26,581
<i>That old saying,
how you always hurt the one you love,</i>

11
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:28,585
<i>well, it works both ways.</i>

12
00:02:29,266 --> 00:02:32,987
<i>We have front-row seats
for this theater of mass destruction.</i>

13
00:02:33,064 --> 00:02:35,222
<i>The Demolitions Committee
of Project Mayhem</i>

14
00:02:35,308 --> 00:02:39,700
<i>wrapped the foundation columns
of a dozen buildings with blasting gelatin.</i>

15
00:02:39,787 --> 00:02:42,309
<i>In two minutes,
primary charges will blow base charges</i>

16
00:02:42,386 --> 00:02:45,704
<i>and a few blocks will be reduced
to smoldering rubble.</i>

17
00:02:46,183 --> 00:02:48,706
<i>I know this because Tyler knows this.</i>

18
00:02:49,185 --> 00:02:52,542
Two and a half.
Think of everything we've accomplished.

19
00:02:52,628 --> 00:02:57,941
<i>Suddenly I realize that all of this,
the gun, the bombs, the revolution...</i>

20
00:02:58,028 --> 00:03:01,346
<i>has got something to do
with a girl named Marla Singer.</i>

21
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:05,383
<i>Bob. Bob had bitch tits.</i>

22
00:03:06,467 --> 00:03:09,948
<i>This was a support group
for men with testicular cancer.</i>

23
00:03:10,025 --> 00:03:13,228
<i>The big moosie slobbering all over me,
that was Bob.</i>

24
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:15,185
We're still men.

25
00:03:15,626 --> 00:03:17,103
Yes, we're men.

26
00:03:17,582 --> 00:03:19,309
Men is what we are.

27
00:03:19,385 --> 00:03:23,222
<i>Bob had had his testicles removed.
Then hormone therapy.</i>

28
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:26,741
<i>He developed bitch tits
'cause his testosterone was too high</i>

29
00:03:26,828 --> 00:03:28,822
<i>and his body upped the estrogen.</i>

30
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:33,023
<i>- That was where I fit.</i>
- They'll have to drain my pecs again.

31
00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:34,903
<i>Between those huge, sweating tits</i>

32
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:38,269
<i>that hung enormous,
the way you'd think of God's as big.</i>

33
00:03:38,346 --> 00:03:40,427
OK, you cry now.

34
00:03:41,702 --> 00:03:44,340
<i>No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.</i>

35
00:03:45,107 --> 00:03:47,466
<i>For six months, I couldn't sleep.</i>

36
00:03:47,581 --> 00:03:49,662
<i>I couldn't sleep...</i>

37
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:52,424
<i>With insomnia, nothing's real.</i>

38
00:03:53,345 --> 00:03:55,148
<i>Everything's far away.</i>

39
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,469
<i>Everything's a copy of a copy</i>

40
00:03:57,546 --> 00:03:58,907
<i>of a copy.</i>

41
00:04:02,264 --> 00:04:04,182
<i>When deep-space exploration ramps up,</i>

42
00:04:04,268 --> 00:04:07,146
<i>it'll be the corporations
that name everything.</i>

43
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,188
<i>The IBM Stellar Sphere.</i>

44
00:04:09,706 --> 00:04:11,461
<i>The Microsoft Galaxy.</i>

45
00:04:11,902 --> 00:04:13,744
<i>The Planet Starbucks.</i>

46
00:04:14,223 --> 00:04:16,985
I need you out of town this week
to cover some red flags.

47
00:04:17,062 --> 00:04:20,505
<i>It must have been Tuesday.
He had on his cornflower-blue tie.</i>

48
00:04:20,582 --> 00:04:25,022
You want me to deprioritize my reports
until you advise of a status upgrade?

49
00:04:25,108 --> 00:04:29,462
Prioritize these. Here's your flight
coupons. Call me if there's any snags.

50
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:33,145
<i>He was full of pep.
Must have had his grande latte enema.</i>

51
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:39,983
<i>Like so many others, I had become
a slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.</i>

52
00:04:40,587 --> 00:04:44,663
- I'd like to order Erika Pekkari dust ruffles.
- Please hold.

53
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,387
<i>If I saw something clever,
like a coffee table</i>

54
00:04:47,464 --> 00:04:50,341
<i>in the shape of a yin-yang,
I had to have it.</i>

55
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:53,669
<i>The Klipsk personal office unit.</i>

56
00:04:53,745 --> 00:04:56,220
<i>The Hovetrekke home exerbike.</i>

57
00:04:56,306 --> 00:04:59,864
<i>Or the Ohamshab sofa
with the Strinne green stripe pattern.</i>

58
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:04,583
<i>Even the Ryslampa wire lamps of
environmentally friendly unbleached paper.</i>

59
00:05:05,062 --> 00:05:06,903
<i>I'd flip through catalogs and wonder...</i>

60
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,068
<i>What kind of dining set
defines me as a person?</i>

61
00:05:10,989 --> 00:05:15,506
<i>I had it all. Even the glass dishes
with tiny bubbles and imperfections,</i>

62
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,626
<i>proof that they were
crafted by the honest,</i>

63
00:05:17,702 --> 00:05:20,186
<i>hard-working, indigenous peoples of...</i>

64
00:05:20,263 --> 00:05:21,586
- Please hold.
<i>- wherever.</i>

65
00:05:24,185 --> 00:05:25,988
<i>We used to read pornography.</i>

66
00:05:26,065 --> 00:05:27,906
<i>Now it was the Horchow collection.</i>

67
00:05:27,983 --> 00:05:32,107
- No. You can't die of insomnia.
- What about narcolepsy?

68
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:36,586
I nod off, I wake up in strange places.
I have no idea how I got there.

69
00:05:36,662 --> 00:05:40,508
- You need to lighten up.
- Can you please just give me something?

70
00:05:40,585 --> 00:05:43,500
Red and blue Tuinals,
lipstick-red Seconals...

71
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:47,222
No. You need healthy, natural sleep.

72
00:05:47,941 --> 00:05:51,106
Chew some valerian root
and get more exercise.

73
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:57,982
- Hey, come on. I'm in pain.
- You wanna see pain?

74
00:05:58,068 --> 00:06:02,662
Swing by First Methodist, Tuesday nights.
See the guys with testicular cancer.

75
00:06:03,305 --> 00:06:04,782
That's pain.

76
00:06:19,781 --> 00:06:23,387
I always wanted three kids.
Two boys and a girl.

77
00:06:24,221 --> 00:06:26,581
Mindy wanted two girls and a boy.

78
00:06:27,146 --> 00:06:29,467
We never could agree on anything.

79
00:06:30,743 --> 00:06:33,860
Well, she had her first child last week.

80
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,941
A girl.

81
00:06:37,466 --> 00:06:39,787
With her new husband.

82
00:06:43,901 --> 00:06:45,781
And thank God. You know?

83
00:06:46,423 --> 00:06:48,101
I'm glad for her.

84
00:06:49,502 --> 00:06:52,705
Because she deserves it.

85
00:06:56,023 --> 00:06:59,303
Everyone, let's thank Thomas
for sharing himself with us.

86
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:00,981
Thank you, Thomas.

87
00:07:01,461 --> 00:07:04,626
I look around this room,
and I see a lot of courage.

88
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:06,860
And that gives me strength.

89
00:07:06,947 --> 00:07:08,980
We give each other strength.

90
00:07:09,267 --> 00:07:10,744
It's time for the one-on-ones.

91
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:15,300
So let's all of us follow Thomas's example
and really open ourselves up.

92
00:07:16,105 --> 00:07:18,062
Could you find a partner?

93
00:07:20,546 --> 00:07:23,020
<i>And this is how I met the big moosie.</i>

94
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,106
<i>His eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.</i>

95
00:07:29,628 --> 00:07:32,668
<i>Knees together.
Those awkward little steps.</i>

96
00:07:38,106 --> 00:07:39,986
- My name is Bob.
- Bob?

97
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,102
<i>Bob had been a champion bodybuilder.</i>

98
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:46,421
<i>You know that chest expansion
program on late-night TV?</i>

99
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,821
<i>That was his idea.</i>

100
00:07:47,907 --> 00:07:49,384
I was a juicer.

101
00:07:50,142 --> 00:07:52,146
You know, using steroids.

102
00:07:53,546 --> 00:07:56,941
Diabonal and Wisterol.

103
00:07:57,421 --> 00:08:00,826
Oh, they use that on racehorses,
for Christ's sakes.

104
00:08:01,823 --> 00:08:05,381
And now I'm bankrupt, I'm divorced,

105
00:08:07,385 --> 00:08:12,027
my two grown kids
won't even return my phone calls.

106
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:17,302
<i>Strangers with this kind of honesty
make me go a big, rubbery one.</i>

107
00:08:19,987 --> 00:08:21,781
Go ahead Cornelius.

108
00:08:22,788 --> 00:08:24,188
You can cry.

109
00:08:38,506 --> 00:08:42,103
<i>And then something happened.
I let go.</i>

110
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,867
That's really good.

111
00:08:44,184 --> 00:08:45,824
<i>Lost in oblivion.</i>

112
00:08:46,265 --> 00:08:48,423
<i>Dark and silent and complete.</i>

113
00:08:50,744 --> 00:08:52,268
<i>I found freedom.</i>

114
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,146
<i>Losing all hope was freedom.</i>

115
00:08:57,102 --> 00:08:58,387
It's OK.

116
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:03,748
<i>Babies don't sleep this well.</i>

117
00:09:06,827 --> 00:09:09,224
<i>I became addicted.</i>

118
00:09:22,421 --> 00:09:26,823
<i>If I didn't say anything,
people always assumed the worst.</i>

119
00:09:30,668 --> 00:09:32,865
<i>They cried harder...</i>

120
00:09:32,941 --> 00:09:34,140
<i>then I cried harder.</i>

121
00:09:42,503 --> 00:09:46,541
Now we're going to open the green door,
the heart chakra...

122
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,660
<i>I wasn't really dying.</i>

123
00:09:49,025 --> 00:09:51,787
<i>I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.</i>

124
00:09:52,381 --> 00:09:55,949
<i>I was the warm little center
that the life of this world crowded around.</i>

125
00:09:56,745 --> 00:10:00,581
Imagine your pain
as a white ball of healing light.

126
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:04,427
It moves over your body, healing you.

127
00:10:05,184 --> 00:10:07,860
Now keep this going.
Remember to breathe.

128
00:10:08,148 --> 00:10:11,303
And step forward
through the back door of the room.

129
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:13,902
Where does it lead?

130
00:10:14,343 --> 00:10:15,906
To your cave.

131
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,666
Step forward into your cave.

132
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:21,987
That's right.

133
00:10:22,342 --> 00:10:25,506
You're going deeper into your cave,

134
00:10:26,024 --> 00:10:30,666
and you're going to find
your power animal.

135
00:10:32,786 --> 00:10:34,109
Slide.

136
00:10:44,505 --> 00:10:46,385
<i>Every evening I died.</i>

137
00:10:47,507 --> 00:10:50,020
<i>And every evening I was born again.</i>

138
00:10:50,662 --> 00:10:51,986
<i>Resurrected.</i>

139
00:10:54,585 --> 00:10:58,584
<i>Bob loved me because he thought
my testicles were removed too.</i>

140
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,947
<i>Being there, pressed against his tits,
ready to cry.</i>

141
00:11:03,504 --> 00:11:05,383
<i>This was my vacation.</i>

142
00:11:09,066 --> 00:11:12,586
<i>And she ruined everything.</i>

143
00:11:12,662 --> 00:11:14,465
This is cancer, right?

144
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:21,706
<i>This chick, Marla Singer,
did not have testicular cancer.</i>

145
00:11:22,262 --> 00:11:23,749
<i>She was a liar.</i>

146
00:11:23,941 --> 00:11:26,185
<i>She had no diseases at all.</i>

147
00:11:26,425 --> 00:11:30,146
<i>I had seen her at Free and Clear,
my blood parasites group, Thursdays.</i>

148
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:33,224
<i>Then at Hope,
my bimonthly sickle-cell circle.</i>

149
00:11:34,145 --> 00:11:37,741
<i>And again at Seize The Day,
my tuberculosis, Friday night.</i>

150
00:11:40,906 --> 00:11:43,620
<i>Marla, the big tourist.</i>

151
00:11:44,263 --> 00:11:46,507
<i>Her lie reflected my lie.</i>

152
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,144
<i>And suddenly, I felt nothing.</i>

153
00:11:49,221 --> 00:11:53,661
<i>I couldn't cry.
So once again, I couldn't sleep.</i>

154
00:12:05,544 --> 00:12:07,942
<i>Next group, after guided meditation,</i>

155
00:12:08,268 --> 00:12:11,260
<i>after we open our heart chakras,
when it's time to hug,</i>

156
00:12:11,346 --> 00:12:14,108
<i>I'll grab that bitch Marla Singer
and scream...</i>

157
00:12:14,185 --> 00:12:18,223
Marla, you liar!
You big tourist! I need this! Now, get out!

158
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:21,742
<i>I hadn't slept in four days.</i>

159
00:12:22,663 --> 00:12:23,747
We'll just let that dry...

160
00:12:23,823 --> 00:12:26,902
<i>When you have insomnia,
you're never really asleep</i>

161
00:12:27,506 --> 00:12:29,664
<i>and you're never really awake.</i>

162
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,783
To begin tonight's communion,
Chloe would like to say a few words.

163
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:39,062
<i>Oh, yeah. Chloe.</i>

164
00:12:40,223 --> 00:12:42,429
<i>Chloe looked the way
Meryl Streep's skeleton would look</i>

165
00:12:42,505 --> 00:12:46,342
<i>if you made it walk around a party
being extra nice to everybody.</i>

166
00:12:46,984 --> 00:12:48,701
Well, I'm still here.

167
00:12:49,343 --> 00:12:51,463
But I don't know for how long.

168
00:12:52,268 --> 00:12:55,184
That's as much certainty
as anyone can give me.

169
00:12:55,827 --> 00:12:57,860
But I've got some good news.

170
00:12:58,426 --> 00:13:00,823
I no longer have any fear of death.

171
00:13:04,506 --> 00:13:08,141
But I am in a pretty lonely place.

172
00:13:09,186 --> 00:13:11,305
No one will have sex with me.

173
00:13:12,466 --> 00:13:13,463
I'm so close to the end,

174
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,580
and all I want is to get laid for
the last time.

175
00:13:17,386 --> 00:13:19,985
I have pornographic movies
in my apartment,

176
00:13:20,061 --> 00:13:23,303
- and lubricants and amyl nitrite.
- Thank you, Chloe.

177
00:13:24,348 --> 00:13:26,382
Everyone, let's thank Chloe.

178
00:13:27,782 --> 00:13:29,508
Thank you, Chloe.

179
00:13:31,349 --> 00:13:34,907
Now, let's ready ourself
for guided meditation.

180
00:13:37,065 --> 00:13:39,981
You're standing at the entrance
of your cave.

181
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:43,548
You step inside your cave and you walk...

182
00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:46,943
<i>If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.</i>

183
00:13:48,104 --> 00:13:49,226
<i>Marla.</i>

184
00:13:49,427 --> 00:13:51,345
<i>The scratch on the roof of your mouth</i>

185
00:13:51,422 --> 00:13:54,740
<i>that would heal if you could stop
tonguing it, but you can't.</i>

186
00:13:54,827 --> 00:13:58,068
Deeper into your cave as you walk.

187
00:13:59,468 --> 00:14:02,662
You feel
a healing energy all around you.

188
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,661
Now find your power animal.

189
00:14:10,948 --> 00:14:12,147
Slide.

190
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:18,266
OK. Let's partner up.

191
00:14:18,822 --> 00:14:21,267
Pick someone special to you tonight.

192
00:14:27,146 --> 00:14:28,182
Hey.

193
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:31,309
- We need to talk.
- Sure.

194
00:14:36,468 --> 00:14:38,108
- I'm onto you.
- What?

195
00:14:38,185 --> 00:14:41,062
Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.

196
00:14:41,906 --> 00:14:42,903
Sorry?

197
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:47,382
In the Tibetan-philosophy,
Sylvia Plath sense, I know we're all dying.

198
00:14:47,468 --> 00:14:50,825
But you're not dying
the way Chloe back there is dying.

199
00:14:51,142 --> 00:14:52,101
So?

200
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,508
So you're a tourist.

201
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:59,063
I've seen you. I saw you at melanoma,
I saw you at tuberculosis.

202
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,106
I saw you at testicular cancer!

203
00:15:01,183 --> 00:15:03,149
I saw you practicing this.

204
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:05,345
- Practicing what?
- Telling me off.

205
00:15:05,422 --> 00:15:08,308
Is it going as well as you hoped,
Rupert?

206
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:12,423
- I'll expose you.
- Go ahead. I'll expose you.

207
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:15,300
Come together. Let yourselves cry.

208
00:15:23,145 --> 00:15:24,823
Oh, God. Why are you doing this?

209
00:15:24,909 --> 00:15:27,221
It's cheaper than a movie
and coffee's free.

210
00:15:27,307 --> 00:15:30,865
Look, this is important.
These are my groups.

211
00:15:30,942 --> 00:15:32,985
I've been coming for over a year.

212
00:15:33,061 --> 00:15:35,948
- Why do you do it?
- I don't know.

213
00:15:36,025 --> 00:15:39,707
When people think you're dying,
they really listen to you instead of...

214
00:15:39,784 --> 00:15:42,585
Instead of waiting for their turn to speak.

215
00:15:43,783 --> 00:15:45,980
Yeah. Yeah.

216
00:15:46,948 --> 00:15:49,423
Share yourself, completely.

217
00:15:50,746 --> 00:15:53,307
You don't want to get into this.
It becomes an addiction.

218
00:15:53,383 --> 00:15:55,541
- Really?
- I'm not kidding.

219
00:15:55,628 --> 00:15:58,907
I can't cry if another faker is present,
and I need this.

220
00:15:58,984 --> 00:16:01,468
So you gotta find somewhere else to go.

221
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:04,508
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.
It's not my problem.

222
00:16:07,385 --> 00:16:09,543
Wait a second. Hold on.

223
00:16:10,224 --> 00:16:13,868
We'll split up the week, OK?
You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.

224
00:16:13,945 --> 00:16:16,506
You take tuberculosis.
My smoking doesn't go over at all.

225
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:19,862
Good. Fine.
Testicular cancer should be no contest.

226
00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:23,823
Technically, I have more right to be there.
You still have your balls.

227
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:26,183
- You're kidding.
- I dunno. Am I?

228
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:27,659
No. No.

229
00:16:27,784 --> 00:16:30,585
- What do you want?
- I'll take the parasites.

230
00:16:30,661 --> 00:16:33,308
You can't have both.
Take the blood parasites.

231
00:16:33,385 --> 00:16:34,900
I want brain parasites.

232
00:16:34,987 --> 00:16:37,787
I'll take the blood,
but I want brain dementia.

233
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:40,348
- I want that.
- You can't have the whole brain.

234
00:16:40,424 --> 00:16:42,908
So far, you have four. I only have two.

235
00:16:42,985 --> 00:16:46,342
OK. Take both the parasites. They're yours.

236
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:48,864
Now we both have three...

237
00:16:52,384 --> 00:16:54,820
Hey! You left half your clothes.

238
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:14,106
- What, are you selling those?
- Yes, I'm selling some clothes.

239
00:17:14,183 --> 00:17:16,187
So, we each have three. That's six.

240
00:17:16,264 --> 00:17:18,585
What about the seventh day?
I want bowel cancer.

241
00:17:18,661 --> 00:17:20,666
<i>The girl had done her homework.</i>

242
00:17:20,742 --> 00:17:25,423
- No. No. I want bowel cancer.
- That's your favorite too?

243
00:17:25,902 --> 00:17:29,383
- Tried to slip it by me, eh?
- Look, we'll split it.

244
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:32,625
Take the first and third Sunday
of the month.

245
00:17:34,783 --> 00:17:35,828
Deal.

246
00:17:38,465 --> 00:17:41,947
- Looks like this is goodbye.
- Let's not make a big thing out of it.

247
00:17:42,024 --> 00:17:44,546
How's this for not making a big thing?

248
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:50,904
Hey, Marla! Marla!

249
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:56,102
- Maybe we should exchange numbers.
- Should we?

250
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:58,461
We might wanna switch nights.

251
00:17:59,622 --> 00:18:00,629
OK.

252
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,388
<i>This is how I met Marla Singer.</i>

253
00:18:09,826 --> 00:18:13,384
<i>Marla's philosophy of life
was that she might die at any moment.</i>

254
00:18:13,461 --> 00:18:15,906
<i>The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't.</i>

255
00:18:15,983 --> 00:18:18,266
It doesn't have your name!
Who are you?

256
00:18:18,342 --> 00:18:21,469
Cornelius? Rupert? Travis?

257
00:18:21,546 --> 00:18:24,346
Any of the stupid names
you give each night?

258
00:18:27,108 --> 00:18:29,026
<i>You wake up at SeaTac.</i>

259
00:18:29,582 --> 00:18:31,942
<i>SFO. LAX.</i>

260
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:37,226
<i>You wake up at O'Hare.
Dallas Fort Worth. BWI.</i>

261
00:18:37,907 --> 00:18:41,944
<i>Pacific. Mountain. Central.
Lose an hour. Gain an hour.</i>

262
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:44,946
Check-in for that flight
isn't for another two hours.

263
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:48,504
<i>This is your life,
and it's ending one minute at a time.</i>

264
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:52,187
<i>You wake up at Air Harbor International.</i>

265
00:18:53,021 --> 00:18:56,541
<i>If you wake up at a different time,
in a different place,</i>

266
00:18:56,944 --> 00:18:59,620
<i>could you wake up as a different person?</i>

267
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,947
<i>Everywhere I travel, tiny life.</i>

268
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:08,107
<i>Single-serving sugar, single-serving cream,
single pat of butter.</i>

269
00:19:08,865 --> 00:19:11,425
<i>The microwave cordon bleu hobby kit.</i>

270
00:19:11,502 --> 00:19:16,307
<i>Shampoo-conditioner combos. Sample
package mouthwash. Tiny bars of soap.</i>

271
00:19:18,465 --> 00:19:22,301
<i>The people I meet on each flight,
they're single-serving friends.</i>

272
00:19:23,624 --> 00:19:28,228
<i>Between takeoff and landing, we have
our time together, but that's all we get.</i>

273
00:19:28,985 --> 00:19:30,184
Welcome!

274
00:19:32,265 --> 00:19:33,464
<i>On a long-enough time line,</i>

275
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:36,581
<i>the survival rate for
everyone drops to zero.</i>

276
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:40,225
<i>I was a recall coordinator.
My job was to apply the formula.</i>

277
00:19:40,302 --> 00:19:43,265
The infant went through the windshield.
Three points.

278
00:19:43,342 --> 00:19:47,265
<i>A new car built by my company
leaves somewhere traveling at 60mph.</i>

279
00:19:47,341 --> 00:19:49,547
<i>The rear differential locks up.</i>

280
00:19:49,624 --> 00:19:52,386
The teenager's braces
are stuck to the ashtray.

281
00:19:52,463 --> 00:19:54,582
Might make a good anti-smoking ad.

282
00:19:54,668 --> 00:19:57,421
<i>The car crashes and burns
with everyone trapped inside.</i>

283
00:19:57,507 --> 00:19:59,780
<i>Now, should we initiate a recall?</i>

284
00:20:00,106 --> 00:20:01,468
The father must've been huge.

285
00:20:01,545 --> 00:20:05,103
See where the fat burned to the seat?
The polyester shirt?

286
00:20:05,189 --> 00:20:06,820
Very modern art.

287
00:20:07,107 --> 00:20:09,745
<i>Take the number of
vehicles in the field, A.</i>

288
00:20:09,821 --> 00:20:12,344
<i>Multiply it by the probable rate
of failure, B.</i>

289
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:16,026
<i>Multiply the result by
the average out-of-court settlement, C.</i>

290
00:20:16,103 --> 00:20:18,347
<i>A x B x C...</i>

291
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:19,747
Equals X.

292
00:20:19,824 --> 00:20:24,226
If X is less than the cost of a recall,
we don't do one.

293
00:20:25,665 --> 00:20:28,187
Are there a lot of these
kinds of accidents?

294
00:20:28,264 --> 00:20:30,067
You wouldn't believe.

295
00:20:31,668 --> 00:20:34,028
Which car company do you work for?

296
00:20:34,948 --> 00:20:36,262
A major one.

297
00:20:38,823 --> 00:20:42,141
<i>Every time the plane banked too sharply
on takeoff or landing,</i>

298
00:20:42,227 --> 00:20:45,584
<i>I prayed for a crash
or a mid-air collision.</i>

299
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,907
<i>Anything.</i>

300
00:20:56,268 --> 00:21:00,181
<i>Life insurance pays off triple
if you die on a business trip.</i>

301
00:21:02,425 --> 00:21:05,225
If you are seated
in an emergency exit row

302
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:11,181
and feel unable or unwilling to perform
the duties listed on the safety card,

303
00:21:11,267 --> 00:21:14,144
please ask a flight attendant
to reseat you.

304
00:21:15,381 --> 00:21:19,429
- It's a lot of responsibility.
- Wanna switch seats?

305
00:21:19,505 --> 00:21:22,824
No. I'm not sure
I'm the man for that particular job.

306
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:26,550
An exit-door procedure
at 30,000 feet.

307
00:21:27,465 --> 00:21:29,268
The illusion of safety.

308
00:21:29,709 --> 00:21:31,301
Yeah. I guess so.

309
00:21:32,145 --> 00:21:34,859
You know why
they put oxygen masks on planes?

310
00:21:34,946 --> 00:21:38,667
- So you can breathe.
- Oxygen gets you high.

311
00:21:39,664 --> 00:21:43,146
In a catastrophic emergency,
you take giant panic breaths.

312
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:46,982
Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.
You accept your fate.

313
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,300
It's all right here.

314
00:21:50,981 --> 00:21:53,465
Emergency water landing, 600mph.

315
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:56,505
Blank faces. Calm as Hindu cows.

316
00:21:57,061 --> 00:21:58,663
That's...

317
00:21:59,507 --> 00:22:01,943
That's an interesting theory.

318
00:22:04,062 --> 00:22:06,508
- What do you do?
- What do you mean?

319
00:22:06,585 --> 00:22:07,946
What do you do for a living?

320
00:22:08,023 --> 00:22:10,862
Why? So you can pretend
you're interested?

321
00:22:13,988 --> 00:22:14,947
OK.

322
00:22:15,024 --> 00:22:18,103
You have a kind of
sick desperation in your laugh.

323
00:22:21,104 --> 00:22:23,464
We have the exact same briefcase.

324
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,622
Soap.

325
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,786
- Sorry?
- I make and I sell soap.

326
00:22:29,467 --> 00:22:31,663
The yardstick of civilization.

327
00:22:32,344 --> 00:22:33,984
<i>And this is how I met...</i>

328
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,586
Tyler Durden.

329
00:22:36,027 --> 00:22:37,782
Did you know if you mix gasoline

330
00:22:37,868 --> 00:22:41,148
and frozen orange juice,
you can make napalm?

331
00:22:41,225 --> 00:22:43,786
- No, I did not. Is that true?
- That's right.

332
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:47,305
One can make all kinds of explosives
using simple household items.

333
00:22:47,382 --> 00:22:49,828
- Really?
- If one were so inclined.

334
00:22:54,824 --> 00:22:59,504
Tyler, you are by far the most interesting
single-serving friend I've ever met.

335
00:23:01,106 --> 00:23:05,383
- Everything on a plane is single-serving...
- Oh, I get it. Very clever.

336
00:23:05,748 --> 00:23:07,023
Thank you.

337
00:23:07,867 --> 00:23:09,785
How's that working out for you?

338
00:23:09,862 --> 00:23:11,540
- What?
- Being clever.

339
00:23:13,027 --> 00:23:17,064
- Great.
- Keep it up then. Keep it right up.

340
00:23:18,983 --> 00:23:19,980
Now, a question of etiquette.

341
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:23,020
As I pass,
do I give you the ass or the crotch?

342
00:23:30,146 --> 00:23:32,380
<i>How I came to live with Tyler is...</i>

343
00:23:32,467 --> 00:23:35,622
<i>Airlines have this policy
about vibrating luggage.</i>

344
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,068
Was it ticking?

345
00:23:45,145 --> 00:23:48,300
Throwers don't worry.
Modern bombs don't tick.

346
00:23:48,387 --> 00:23:50,909
- Sorry. Throwers?
- Baggage handlers.

347
00:23:52,108 --> 00:23:56,021
But when a suitcase vibrates,
the throwers have to call the police.

348
00:23:56,107 --> 00:23:58,668
My suitcase was vibrating?

349
00:23:58,744 --> 00:24:03,827
Nine times out of ten it's an electric
razor, but every once in a while...

350
00:24:06,829 --> 00:24:08,306
it's a dildo.

351
00:24:09,466 --> 00:24:13,341
It's company policy never to imply
ownership in the event of a dildo.

352
00:24:13,427 --> 00:24:19,066
We have to use the indefinite article,
a dildo, never your dildo.

353
00:24:19,143 --> 00:24:20,783
I don't own...

354
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:30,383
<i>I had everything in that suitcase.
My CK shirts. My DKNY shoes. My AX ties.</i>

355
00:24:32,023 --> 00:24:33,500
<i>Never mind.</i>

356
00:24:35,504 --> 00:24:38,027
Hey! That's my car!

357
00:24:44,788 --> 00:24:47,540
<i>Home was a condo on
the 15th floor of a filing cabinet</i>

358
00:24:47,627 --> 00:24:49,823
<i>for widows and young professionals.</i>

359
00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:51,827
<i>The walls were solid concrete.</i>

360
00:24:51,904 --> 00:24:55,069
<i>A foot of concrete's important
when your next-door neighbor</i>

361
00:24:55,146 --> 00:24:57,860
<i>has to watch game shows at full volume.</i>

362
00:24:57,946 --> 00:25:02,060
<i>Or when a blast of debris
that used to be your personal effects</i>

363
00:25:02,147 --> 00:25:05,781
<i>blows out of your windows
and sails flaming into the night.</i>

364
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,269
<i>I suppose these things happen.</i>

365
00:25:26,545 --> 00:25:28,587
There's nothing up there.

366
00:25:28,664 --> 00:25:31,781
You can't go into the unit. Police orders.

367
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:42,628
Do you have somebody you can call?

368
00:25:43,347 --> 00:25:47,586
<i>How embarrassing.
A houseful of condiments and no food.</i>

369
00:25:57,224 --> 00:25:59,142
<i>The police later told me the pilot light</i>

370
00:25:59,229 --> 00:26:02,940
<i>might have gone out,
letting out a little bit of gas.</i>

371
00:26:03,947 --> 00:26:06,422
<i>That gas could have
slowly filled the condo...</i>

372
00:26:06,508 --> 00:26:08,829
<i>1700 square feet with high ceilings...</i>

373
00:26:08,905 --> 00:26:10,747
<i>for days and days.</i>

374
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:21,383
<i>Then the refrigerator's compressor
could have clicked on.</i>

375
00:26:23,186 --> 00:26:24,308
Yeah?

376
00:26:27,146 --> 00:26:29,429
I can hear you breathing, you...

377
00:26:38,664 --> 00:26:42,059
<i>If you ask me now,
I couldn't tell you why I called him.</i>

378
00:27:22,943 --> 00:27:24,622
- Hello?
- Who's this?

379
00:27:26,741 --> 00:27:29,187
- Tyler?
- Who is this?

380
00:27:30,788 --> 00:27:32,985
We met... We met on the airplane.

381
00:27:33,061 --> 00:27:34,989
We had the same suitcase?

382
00:27:35,545 --> 00:27:39,103
- The clever guy.
- Oh, yeah. Right.

383
00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:45,021
I called a second ago.
There was no answer. I'm at a payphone.

384
00:27:45,107 --> 00:27:47,907
Yeah, I *69'd you.
I never pick up my phone.

385
00:27:50,506 --> 00:27:52,261
So what's up?

386
00:27:53,268 --> 00:27:54,505
Well...

387
00:27:55,301 --> 00:27:56,903
You're not gonna believe this.

388
00:27:59,866 --> 00:28:01,420
It could be worse.

389
00:28:01,506 --> 00:28:05,822
A woman could cut off your penis
while you sleep and toss it out of a car.

390
00:28:06,263 --> 00:28:08,066
There's always that.

391
00:28:08,421 --> 00:28:11,145
It's just, when you buy furniture,
you tell yourself...

392
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:13,542
That's the last sofa I'll need.

393
00:28:13,629 --> 00:28:17,263
Whatever else happens,
I've got that sofa problem handled.

394
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:20,428
I had it all.
I had a stereo that was very decent.

395
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:23,066
A wardrobe that was
getting very respectable.

396
00:28:23,142 --> 00:28:25,703
I was close to being complete.

397
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:28,743
- Shit, man. And now it's all gone.
- All gone.

398
00:28:29,587 --> 00:28:30,987
All gone.

399
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:35,025
Do you know what a duvet is?

400
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:38,468
- A comforter.
- It's a blanket. Just a blanket.

401
00:28:38,986 --> 00:28:41,307
Why do guys like us know what a duvet is?

402
00:28:41,383 --> 00:28:45,383
Is this essential to our survival
in the hunter-gatherer sense?

403
00:28:45,622 --> 00:28:46,744
No.

404
00:28:47,349 --> 00:28:51,348
- What are we then?
- I dunno. Consumers.

405
00:28:51,626 --> 00:28:53,544
Right. We're consumers.

406
00:28:53,745 --> 00:28:56,584
We are by-products of
a lifestyle obsession.

407
00:28:57,505 --> 00:29:00,823
Murder, crime, poverty.
These things don't concern me.

408
00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:03,624
What concerns me
are celebrity magazines,

409
00:29:04,103 --> 00:29:06,386
television with 500 channels,

410
00:29:06,462 --> 00:29:08,026
some guy's name on my underwear.

411
00:29:08,102 --> 00:29:10,586
Rogaine. Viagra. Olestra.

412
00:29:10,663 --> 00:29:13,185
- Martha Stewart.
- Fuck Martha Stewart.

413
00:29:13,703 --> 00:29:17,108
She's polishing the brass on the Titanic.
It's all going down.

414
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:21,222
So fuck off with your sofa units
and Strinne green stripe patterns.

415
00:29:21,462 --> 00:29:23,667
I say never be complete.

416
00:29:23,744 --> 00:29:25,749
I say stop being perfect.

417
00:29:26,027 --> 00:29:27,945
I say let's evolve.

418
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:30,668
Let the chips fall where they may.

419
00:29:32,587 --> 00:29:36,346
But that's me, and I could be wrong.
Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.

420
00:29:36,423 --> 00:29:39,540
It's just stuff, it's not a tragedy.

421
00:29:39,626 --> 00:29:42,983
You did lose a lot of versatile solutions
for modern living.

422
00:29:43,069 --> 00:29:45,620
Fuck, you're right.
No, I don't smoke.

423
00:29:48,909 --> 00:29:51,825
My insurance is probably
gonna cover it, so...

424
00:29:55,306 --> 00:29:59,421
- What?
- The things you own end up owning you.

425
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,782
But do what you like, man.

426
00:30:06,661 --> 00:30:08,148
Oh, it's late.

427
00:30:08,742 --> 00:30:11,303
- Hey, thanks for the beer.
- Yeah, man.

428
00:30:11,504 --> 00:30:13,307
I should find a hotel.

429
00:30:13,586 --> 00:30:14,861
What?

430
00:30:15,945 --> 00:30:16,942
What?

431
00:30:17,029 --> 00:30:18,505
- A hotel?
- Yeah.

432
00:30:18,908 --> 00:30:21,661
- Just ask, man.
- What are you talking about?

433
00:30:21,747 --> 00:30:25,142
Oh, God. Three pitchers of beer
and you still can't ask.

434
00:30:28,105 --> 00:30:29,026
- What?
- You called me

435
00:30:29,103 --> 00:30:30,944
'cause you need a place to stay.

436
00:30:31,021 --> 00:30:34,387
- Oh, hey. No, no, no.
- Yes, you did. So just ask.

437
00:30:34,464 --> 00:30:36,900
Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.

438
00:30:38,664 --> 00:30:40,746
Would... Would that be a problem?

439
00:30:40,822 --> 00:30:43,028
Is it a problem for you to ask?

440
00:30:43,901 --> 00:30:46,145
- Can I stay at your place?
- Yeah.

441
00:30:47,785 --> 00:30:48,907
Thanks.

442
00:30:53,261 --> 00:30:56,023
- I want you to do me a favor.
- Yeah, sure.

443
00:30:56,263 --> 00:30:58,900
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

444
00:30:59,389 --> 00:31:03,782
- What?
- I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

445
00:31:04,664 --> 00:31:06,707
<i>Let me tell you a little
about Tyler Durden.</i>

446
00:31:07,944 --> 00:31:11,780
Tyler was a night person.
While the rest of us slept, he worked.

447
00:31:11,866 --> 00:31:14,581
He had one part-time job
as a projectionist.

448
00:31:14,667 --> 00:31:18,024
A movie doesn't come all on one big reel.
It comes on a few.

449
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:21,342
So someone has to switch the projectors
at the exact moment

450
00:31:21,428 --> 00:31:23,826
that one reel ends
and the next one begins.

451
00:31:23,902 --> 00:31:28,669
If you look, you can see little dots come
into the upper right corner of the screen.

452
00:31:28,746 --> 00:31:31,460
In the industry,
we call them cigarette burns.

453
00:31:31,546 --> 00:31:33,186
That's the cue for a changeover.

454
00:31:33,263 --> 00:31:37,866
He flips the projectors, movie keeps
going and the audience has no idea.

455
00:31:38,183 --> 00:31:40,580
Why would anyone want this shit job?

456
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:43,342
'Cause it affords him
interesting opportunities.

457
00:31:43,429 --> 00:31:46,267
Like splicing a frame of pornography
into family films.

458
00:31:46,344 --> 00:31:48,828
So when the snooty cat
and the courageous dog

459
00:31:48,905 --> 00:31:52,022
with the celebrity voices first meet,

460
00:31:52,108 --> 00:31:55,666
you'll catch a flash
of Tyler's contribution to the film.

461
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,988
Nobody knows
that they saw it but they did.

462
00:32:05,064 --> 00:32:06,983
Nice big cock.

463
00:32:11,941 --> 00:32:14,501
Even a hummingbird
couldn't catch Tyler at work.

464
00:32:19,747 --> 00:32:24,303
Tyler also works sometimes as a banquet
waiter at the luxurious Pressman Hotel.

465
00:32:29,223 --> 00:32:32,781
He was the guerrilla terrorist
of the food service industry.

466
00:32:33,222 --> 00:32:35,303
Do not watch.
I cannot go when you watch.

467
00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:37,144
Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque,

468
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:39,743
he farted on meringues,
sneezed on endives.

469
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:42,342
As for the cream of mushroom soup...

470
00:32:42,429 --> 00:32:45,709
- Go ahead, tell 'em.
- You get the idea.

471
00:32:46,102 --> 00:32:49,305
- You just want me to hit you?
- Come on. Do me this one favor.

472
00:32:49,382 --> 00:32:52,508
- Why?
- I don't know. Never been in a fight. You?

473
00:32:52,585 --> 00:32:56,661
- No. But that's a good thing.
- You can't know yourself if you haven't.

474
00:32:56,987 --> 00:32:59,068
I don't wanna die without any scars.

475
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:03,182
- Come on. Hit me, before I lose my nerve.
- Oh, God. This is crazy.

476
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:05,148
So go crazy! Let it rip.

477
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:08,342
- I don't know about this.
- I don't either.

478
00:33:08,428 --> 00:33:11,229
Who gives a shit? No one's watching.
What do you care?

479
00:33:11,305 --> 00:33:13,540
This is crazy. You want me to hit you?

480
00:33:13,626 --> 00:33:15,065
That's right.

481
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:18,508
- Where? Like in the face?
- Surprise me.

482
00:33:20,829 --> 00:33:22,785
This is so fucking stupid.

483
00:33:33,028 --> 00:33:37,305
Motherfucker!
You hit me in the ear!

484
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:40,422
- Well, Jesus, I'm sorry.
- Christ!

485
00:33:40,901 --> 00:33:42,100
Why the ear, man?

486
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,546
- I fucked it up.
- No, that was perfect.

487
00:33:56,745 --> 00:33:58,663
No, it's all right.

488
00:33:59,986 --> 00:34:01,741
It really hurts.

489
00:34:02,029 --> 00:34:03,142
Right.

490
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:08,541
- Hit me again.
- No, you hit me. Come on!

491
00:34:24,787 --> 00:34:27,185
We should do this again sometime.

492
00:34:39,384 --> 00:34:41,427
- Where's your car?
- What car?

493
00:34:52,101 --> 00:34:56,186
<i>I don't know how Tyler found that house,
but he said he'd been there for a year.</i>

494
00:34:56,263 --> 00:34:59,303
<i>It looked like it was
waiting to be torn down.</i>

495
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:01,662
<i>Most of the windows were boarded up.</i>

496
00:35:01,749 --> 00:35:03,187
<i>There was no lock on the front door</i>

497
00:35:03,264 --> 00:35:06,227
<i>from when the police,
or whoever, kicked it in.</i>

498
00:35:06,429 --> 00:35:08,826
<i>The stairs were ready to collapse.</i>

499
00:35:08,903 --> 00:35:11,627
<i>I didn't know if he owned it
or was squatting.</i>

500
00:35:11,703 --> 00:35:14,101
<i>Neither would have surprised me.</i>

501
00:35:14,427 --> 00:35:15,942
Yep. That's you.

502
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:19,107
That's me. That's the toilet. Good?

503
00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:20,584
Yeah, thanks.

504
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,423
<i>What a shithole.</i>

505
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:26,185
<i>Nothing worked.</i>

506
00:35:29,024 --> 00:35:32,668
<i>Turning on one light meant
another light in the house went out.</i>

507
00:35:32,745 --> 00:35:35,900
<i>There were no neighbors.
Just warehouses and a paper mill.</i>

508
00:35:35,986 --> 00:35:39,746
<i>That fart smell of steam.
The hamster-cage smell of wood chips.</i>

509
00:35:41,664 --> 00:35:43,582
Hey. What have we here?

510
00:35:58,227 --> 00:35:59,780
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

511
00:36:11,346 --> 00:36:14,386
<i>Every time it rained,
we had to kill the power.</i>

512
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:17,781
<i>By the end of the first month,
I didn't miss TV.</i>

513
00:36:18,903 --> 00:36:22,260
<i>I didn't even mind the warm,
stale refrigerator.</i>

514
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,262
Can I be next?

515
00:36:40,424 --> 00:36:41,863
All right, man.

516
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,340
Lose the tie.

517
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:51,904
<i>At night, Tyler and I were alone
for half a mile in every direction.</i>

518
00:36:57,706 --> 00:37:01,063
<i>Rain trickled down through
the plaster and the light fixtures.</i>

519
00:37:01,149 --> 00:37:03,662
<i>Everything wooden swelled and shrank.</i>

520
00:37:03,748 --> 00:37:06,865
<i>Everywhere were rusted nails
to snag your elbow on.</i>

521
00:37:07,383 --> 00:37:10,461
<i>The previous occupant
had been a bit of a shut-in.</i>

522
00:37:10,548 --> 00:37:12,706
- What are you reading?
- Listen to this.

523
00:37:12,782 --> 00:37:16,101
It's an article written
by an organ in the first person.

524
00:37:16,187 --> 00:37:18,422
I am Jack's medulla oblongata.

525
00:37:18,508 --> 00:37:20,186
Without me, Jack could not regulate

526
00:37:20,263 --> 00:37:22,785
his heart rate,
blood pressure or breathing.

527
00:37:22,862 --> 00:37:24,905
There's a whole series of these.

528
00:37:24,981 --> 00:37:29,144
I am Jill's nipples.
I am Jack's colon.

529
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,704
Yeah. I get cancer. I kill Jack.

530
00:37:35,301 --> 00:37:39,300
<i>After fighting, everything else in life
got the volume turned down.</i>

531
00:37:41,669 --> 00:37:42,580
What?

532
00:37:42,666 --> 00:37:46,502
<i>- You could deal with anything.</i>
- Have you finished those reports?

533
00:37:50,981 --> 00:37:52,746
If you could choose,
who would you fight?

534
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,546
I'd fight my boss, probably.

535
00:37:55,623 --> 00:37:56,745
Really?

536
00:37:57,704 --> 00:38:00,907
- Yeah. Why? Who would you fight?
- I'd fight my dad.

537
00:38:01,224 --> 00:38:02,902
I don't know my dad.

538
00:38:02,988 --> 00:38:06,508
I mean, I know him, but he left
when I was like six years old.

539
00:38:06,585 --> 00:38:09,021
Married this other woman
and had some other kids.

540
00:38:09,107 --> 00:38:10,900
He did this every six years.

541
00:38:10,987 --> 00:38:15,465
- He moves city and starts a new family.
- Fucker's setting up franchises.

542
00:38:17,268 --> 00:38:20,980
My dad never went to college,
so it was real important that I go.

543
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:22,428
That sounds familiar.

544
00:38:22,505 --> 00:38:26,187
So I graduate. I call him up long distance
and say, Dad, now what?

545
00:38:26,264 --> 00:38:28,345
- He says, get a job.
- Same here.

546
00:38:28,422 --> 00:38:32,901
Now I'm 25. Make my yearly call again.
Dad, now what?

547
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,346
He says, I dunno. Get married.

548
00:38:37,504 --> 00:38:39,307
You can't get married.

549
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,503
I'm a 30-year-old boy.

550
00:38:41,743 --> 00:38:44,706
We're a generation of men
raised by women.

551
00:38:44,783 --> 00:38:48,428
I'm wondering if another woman
is really the answer we need.

552
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:57,068
<i>Most of the week,
we were Ozzie and Harriet.</i>

553
00:38:58,344 --> 00:39:01,749
<i>But every Saturday night,
we were finding something out.</i>

554
00:39:02,621 --> 00:39:06,026
<i>We were finding out more and more
that we were not alone.</i>

555
00:39:09,709 --> 00:39:13,660
<i>It used to be that when I came home angry
or depressed, I'd just clean my condo.</i>

556
00:39:13,746 --> 00:39:16,067
<i>Polish my Scandinavian furniture.</i>

557
00:39:16,345 --> 00:39:18,580
<i>I should have been
looking for a new condo,</i>

558
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:21,140
<i>haggling with my insurance company.</i>

559
00:39:21,227 --> 00:39:25,821
<i>I should have been upset about my nice
flaming little shit but I wasn't.</i>

560
00:39:26,147 --> 00:39:29,868
The premise of cybernetting an office
is make things more efficient.

561
00:39:29,944 --> 00:39:33,061
<i>Monday mornings,
all I thought about was next week.</i>

562
00:39:33,148 --> 00:39:35,900
Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?

563
00:39:35,986 --> 00:39:37,425
Absolutely.

564
00:39:37,703 --> 00:39:40,101
Efficiency is priority No. 1, people.

565
00:39:40,427 --> 00:39:42,623
Because waste is a thief.

566
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,824
I showed this to my man here.
You liked it, didn't you?

567
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:53,345
<i>You can swallow a pint of blood
before you get sick.</i>

568
00:39:54,908 --> 00:39:58,821
<i>It was right in everyone's face.
Tyler and I just made it visible.</i>

569
00:39:58,984 --> 00:40:03,463
<i>It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.
Tyler and I just gave it a name.</i>

570
00:40:14,022 --> 00:40:16,746
Come on, people, you've gotta go home!

571
00:40:37,346 --> 00:40:39,782
Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.

572
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:04,026
<i>Every week, Tyler gave the rules
that he and I decided.</i>

573
00:41:04,103 --> 00:41:05,542
Gentlemen!

574
00:41:06,107 --> 00:41:07,987
Welcome to Fight Club.

575
00:41:10,423 --> 00:41:14,269
The first rule of Fight Club is
you do not talk about Fight Club.

576
00:41:14,988 --> 00:41:17,386
The second rule of Fight Club is...

577
00:41:17,549 --> 00:41:20,225
you do not talk about Fight Club!

578
00:41:21,222 --> 00:41:22,584
Third rule of Fight Club...

579
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:26,027
someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,

580
00:41:26,103 --> 00:41:27,705
the fight is over.

581
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:30,582
Fourth rule, only two guys to a fight.

582
00:41:31,263 --> 00:41:33,948
Fifth rule, one fight at a time, fellas.

583
00:41:35,301 --> 00:41:37,823
Sixth rule, no shirts, no shoes.

584
00:41:38,187 --> 00:41:42,062
Seventh rule, fights will go on
as long as they have to.

585
00:41:44,383 --> 00:41:49,581
And the eighth and final rule, if this is
your first night at Fight Club,

586
00:41:50,588 --> 00:41:51,700
you have to fight.

587
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:58,068
<i>This kid from work, Ricky,</i>

588
00:41:58,145 --> 00:42:02,269
<i>couldn't remember whether
you ordered pens with blue ink or black.</i>

589
00:42:03,468 --> 00:42:05,309
<i>But Ricky was a god for ten minutes</i>

590
00:42:05,386 --> 00:42:08,867
<i>when he trounced
the maitre d' of a local food court.</i>

591
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:12,540
<i>Sometimes,
all you could hear were the flat,</i>

592
00:42:12,627 --> 00:42:15,465
<i>hard, packing sounds over the yelling.</i>

593
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,900
<i>Or the wet choke
when someone gasped and sprayed...</i>

594
00:42:21,987 --> 00:42:23,147
Stop!

595
00:42:23,665 --> 00:42:26,226
<i>You weren't alive anywhere
like you were there.</i>

596
00:42:26,302 --> 00:42:31,107
<i>But Fight Club only exists in the hours
between when Fight Club starts and ends.</i>

597
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:34,262
<i>Even if I could tell someone
they had a good fight,</i>

598
00:42:34,349 --> 00:42:36,622
<i>I wouldn't be talking to the same man.</i>

599
00:42:36,708 --> 00:42:37,984
<i>Who you were in Fight Club</i>

600
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:40,822
<i>is not who you were
in the rest of the world.</i>

601
00:42:40,909 --> 00:42:45,061
<i>A guy came to Fight Club for the first
time. His ass was a wad of cookie dough.</i>

602
00:42:45,148 --> 00:42:48,264
<i>After a few weeks,
he was carved out of wood.</i>

603
00:42:48,907 --> 00:42:51,707
If you could fight any celebrity,
who would you fight?

604
00:42:51,784 --> 00:42:54,786
- Alive or dead?
- Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?

605
00:42:55,822 --> 00:42:58,028
Hemingway. You?

606
00:42:59,428 --> 00:43:02,343
Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.

607
00:43:04,185 --> 00:43:06,860
<i>We all started seeing things differently.</i>

608
00:43:07,541 --> 00:43:10,783
<i>Everywhere we went,
we were sizing things up.</i>

609
00:43:14,667 --> 00:43:17,103
<i>I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,</i>

610
00:43:17,189 --> 00:43:21,064
<i>trying to look like how Calvin Klein
or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.</i>

611
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:23,461
Is that what a man looks like?

612
00:43:23,902 --> 00:43:26,501
Ah, self-improvement is masturbation.

613
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:29,024
Now, self-destruction...

614
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,462
Excuse me.

615
00:44:04,182 --> 00:44:06,666
<i>Fight Club wasn't about winning or losing.</i>

616
00:44:06,743 --> 00:44:08,623
<i>It wasn't about words.</i>

617
00:44:11,145 --> 00:44:15,748
<i>The hysterical shouting was in tongues,
like at a Pentecostal Church.</i>

618
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,346
- Is that it?
- Stop!

619
00:44:22,788 --> 00:44:25,626
<i>When the fight was over,
nothing was solved.</i>

620
00:44:26,029 --> 00:44:27,621
<i>But nothing mattered.</i>

621
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:28,743
Cool.

622
00:44:31,026 --> 00:44:33,423
<i>Afterwards, we all felt saved.</i>

623
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:35,821
Hey, man. How about next week?

624
00:44:36,866 --> 00:44:38,708
How about next month?

625
00:44:39,024 --> 00:44:41,988
Irvine, you're in the middle.
New guy, you too.

626
00:44:44,424 --> 00:44:46,265
<i>Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.</i>

627
00:44:46,342 --> 00:44:48,260
He fell down some stairs.

628
00:44:48,864 --> 00:44:50,868
I fell down some stairs.

629
00:44:52,949 --> 00:44:57,140
<i>Fight Club became the reason to cut
your hair short or trim your fingernails.</i>

630
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:59,145
OK. Any historical figure.

631
00:45:00,181 --> 00:45:03,700
- I'd fight Gandhi.
- Good answer.

632
00:45:04,621 --> 00:45:06,501
- How about you?
- Lincoln.

633
00:45:06,865 --> 00:45:08,128
Lincoln?

634
00:45:09,023 --> 00:45:12,504
Big guy, big reach.
Skinny guys fight till they're burger.

635
00:45:12,869 --> 00:45:13,904
Fuck!

636
00:45:16,225 --> 00:45:18,863
Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.

637
00:45:27,427 --> 00:45:28,386
Hello?

638
00:45:28,463 --> 00:45:31,186
Where have you been
the last eight weeks?

639
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,462
Marla?

640
00:45:35,703 --> 00:45:38,667
- How did you find me?
- You left a forwarding number.

641
00:45:38,744 --> 00:45:41,429
I haven't seen you at any support groups.

642
00:45:41,544 --> 00:45:44,344
We split 'em up.
That was the idea. Remember?

643
00:45:44,786 --> 00:45:47,500
Yeah, but you haven't been going to yours.

644
00:45:47,701 --> 00:45:49,868
- How do you know?
- I cheated.

645
00:45:51,384 --> 00:45:52,985
I found a new one.

646
00:45:53,263 --> 00:45:55,306
- Really?
- It's for men only.

647
00:45:55,508 --> 00:45:57,023
Like the testicle thing?

648
00:46:01,348 --> 00:46:04,782
- Look, this is a bad time.
- I've been going to Debtors Anonymous.

649
00:46:04,868 --> 00:46:07,707
- Some really fucked-up people.
- I'm on my way out.

650
00:46:07,783 --> 00:46:10,469
Me too. I've got a stomach full of Xanax.

651
00:46:10,824 --> 00:46:14,660
I took what was left of a bottle.
It might have been too much.

652
00:46:14,746 --> 00:46:18,582
<i>Picture Marla Singer throwing herself
around her crummy apartment.</i>

653
00:46:18,668 --> 00:46:22,342
This isn't a for-real suicide.
It's probably a cry for help.

654
00:46:22,907 --> 00:46:24,423
<i>This could go on for hours.</i>

655
00:46:24,509 --> 00:46:28,508
- So you're staying in tonight?
- Do you wanna hear me describe death?

656
00:46:29,381 --> 00:46:33,303
Do you wanna listen
and see if my spirit can use a phone?

657
00:46:35,385 --> 00:46:37,389
Have you ever heard a death rattle before?

658
00:47:02,669 --> 00:47:04,664
<i>Tyler's door was closed.</i>

659
00:47:04,741 --> 00:47:07,781
<i>I'd been here for two months
and his door was never closed.</i>

660
00:47:13,545 --> 00:47:15,866
You won't believe the dream
I had last night.

661
00:47:15,942 --> 00:47:18,867
I can hardly believe
anything from last night.

662
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:30,309
What are you doing here?

663
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:35,421
- What?
- This is my house.

664
00:47:35,507 --> 00:47:37,425
What are you doing here?

665
00:47:39,468 --> 00:47:40,705
Fuck you!

666
00:47:55,263 --> 00:47:58,227
Oh, you've got some fucked-up friends!

667
00:47:59,425 --> 00:48:02,024
Limber though. Silly cooze.

668
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:07,740
I come in last night. Phone's off the hook.
Guess who's on the other end.

669
00:48:07,827 --> 00:48:10,224
<i>I knew the story before he told me.</i>

670
00:48:13,542 --> 00:48:16,544
Have you ever heard
a death rattle before?

671
00:48:16,621 --> 00:48:19,460
Do you think it'll live up to its name?

672
00:48:19,546 --> 00:48:22,308
Or will it just be a death hairball?

673
00:48:25,463 --> 00:48:28,782
Prepare to evacuate soul.

674
00:48:29,386 --> 00:48:33,864
Ten, nine, eight...

675
00:48:34,028 --> 00:48:37,068
<i>How could Tyler, of all people,
think it was a bad thing</i>

676
00:48:37,144 --> 00:48:39,628
<i>that Marla Singer was about to die?</i>

677
00:48:40,069 --> 00:48:44,587
Five, four, three...

678
00:48:44,865 --> 00:48:46,227
Hang on.

679
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:53,064
You got here fast.

680
00:48:55,462 --> 00:48:56,949
Did I call you?

681
00:49:07,306 --> 00:49:10,308
The mattress is all sealed
in slippery plastic.

682
00:49:12,821 --> 00:49:15,381
Don't worry. It's not a threat to you.

683
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:22,143
Oh, fuck! Somebody called the cops.

684
00:49:33,785 --> 00:49:36,586
- Hey, where's 513?
- End of the hall.

685
00:49:37,948 --> 00:49:41,304
The girl who lives there
used to be a charming, lovely girl.

686
00:49:41,381 --> 00:49:43,424
She has lost faith in herself.

687
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:46,147
- Miss Singer, let us help you!
- She's a monster!

688
00:49:46,224 --> 00:49:50,262
- You have every reason to live.
- She's infectious human waste!

689
00:49:50,348 --> 00:49:53,148
- Miss Singer!
- Good luck trying to save her!

690
00:49:59,305 --> 00:50:02,662
If I fall asleep, I'm done for.

691
00:50:04,302 --> 00:50:06,661
You're gonna have to keep me up...

692
00:50:07,141 --> 00:50:08,742
all night.

693
00:50:09,145 --> 00:50:10,987
Un-fucking-believable.

694
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:13,221
<i>He was obviously able to handle it.</i>

695
00:50:13,307 --> 00:50:16,549
- You know what I mean. You fucked her.
- No, I didn't.

696
00:50:18,026 --> 00:50:19,301
- Never?
- No.

697
00:50:20,989 --> 00:50:24,145
- You're not into her, are you?
- No! God, not at all.

698
00:50:24,509 --> 00:50:26,581
<i>I am Jack's raging bile duct.</i>

699
00:50:26,667 --> 00:50:30,100
- Are you sure? You can tell me.
- Believe me, I'm sure.

700
00:50:30,187 --> 00:50:31,385
<i>Put a gun to my head</i>

701
00:50:31,462 --> 00:50:33,620
<i>- and spray my brains.</i>
- That's good.

702
00:50:33,706 --> 00:50:36,785
She's a predator posing as a house pet.
Stay away.

703
00:50:39,624 --> 00:50:42,261
The shit that came out of
this woman's mouth, I had never heard!

704
00:50:42,347 --> 00:50:43,460
My God.

705
00:50:43,824 --> 00:50:46,989
I haven't been fucked like that
since grade school.

706
00:50:47,529 --> 00:50:49,828
<i>How could Tyler not go for that?</i>

707
00:50:49,904 --> 00:50:53,108
<i>The other night, he was splicing
sex organs into Cinderella.</i>

708
00:50:53,184 --> 00:50:55,429
Marla doesn't need a lover,
just a caseworker.

709
00:50:55,505 --> 00:50:58,507
And a wash.
This isn't love, it's sport fucking.

710
00:50:58,948 --> 00:51:01,825
<i>She invaded my support groups
and now my home.</i>

711
00:51:01,902 --> 00:51:03,580
Hey, hey. Sit down.

712
00:51:07,867 --> 00:51:11,588
- I can't have you talking to her about me.
- Why would I talk to her?

713
00:51:11,665 --> 00:51:13,382
You say anything about me
or what goes on

714
00:51:13,468 --> 00:51:16,623
in this house to her or anybody,
we're done.

715
00:51:17,429 --> 00:51:19,146
- Now promise me.
- OK.

716
00:51:19,625 --> 00:51:21,140
- You promise?
- I promise.

717
00:51:21,227 --> 00:51:23,941
- Promise.
- I just said, I promise! What...

718
00:51:24,027 --> 00:51:26,262
That's three times you promised.

719
00:51:27,422 --> 00:51:31,421
<i>If only I had wasted a couple of minutes
and gone to watch Marla Singer die,</i>

720
00:51:31,508 --> 00:51:33,704
<i>none of this would've happened.</i>

721
00:51:37,904 --> 00:51:40,149
Yes! Oh, harder, harder!

722
00:51:47,869 --> 00:51:50,382
<i>I could have moved to another room.</i>

723
00:51:50,468 --> 00:51:54,189
<i>On the third floor
where I might not have heard them.</i>

724
00:51:54,745 --> 00:51:56,145
<i>But I didn't.</i>

725
00:52:19,546 --> 00:52:22,423
- What are you doing?
- Just going to bed.

726
00:52:23,986 --> 00:52:26,585
You wanna finish her off?

727
00:52:27,986 --> 00:52:30,901
- No. No, thank you.
- I found a cigarette.

728
00:52:32,464 --> 00:52:34,382
- Who were you talking to?
- Shut up.

729
00:52:35,629 --> 00:52:38,660
<i>I became the calm
little center of the world.</i>

730
00:52:38,746 --> 00:52:40,501
<i>I was the Zen master.</i>

731
00:52:45,584 --> 00:52:47,627
<i>I wrote little haiku poems.</i>

732
00:52:48,269 --> 00:52:50,389
<i>I emailed them to everyone.</i>

733
00:52:51,261 --> 00:52:52,901
Is that your blood?

734
00:52:54,983 --> 00:52:56,143
Some of it, yeah.

735
00:52:56,229 --> 00:52:57,620
You can't smoke in here.

736
00:52:59,902 --> 00:53:03,384
Take the rest of the day off.
Come back Monday with clean clothes.

737
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,187
Get yourself together.

738
00:53:05,263 --> 00:53:09,982
<i>I got right in everyone's hostile face.
Yes, these are bruises from fighting.</i>

739
00:53:10,222 --> 00:53:13,703
<i>Yes, I'm comfortable with that.
I am enlightened.</i>

740
00:53:16,187 --> 00:53:20,426
<i>You give up the condo life and
all your flaming worldly possessions,</i>

741
00:53:20,829 --> 00:53:24,463
<i>go live in a dilapidated house
in a toxic-waste part of town,</i>

742
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:26,660
<i>and you have to come home to this.</i>

743
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:38,907
Hello?

744
00:53:38,983 --> 00:53:41,947
This is Detective Stern
with the Arson Unit.

745
00:53:42,465 --> 00:53:46,262
We have new information about
the incident at your former condo.

746
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:48,065
- Yes?
- I don't know if you're aware,

747
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:52,026
but someone sprayed Freon
into your front-door lock.

748
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:54,903
They used a chisel to shatter the cylinder.

749
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:58,260
- No, I wasn't aware of that.
<i>- I am Jack's cold sweat.</i>

750
00:53:58,663 --> 00:54:02,509
- Does this sound strange to you?
- Yes, sir. Very strange.

751
00:54:03,027 --> 00:54:04,503
- The dynamite...
- Dynamite?

752
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:08,464
left a residue of ammonium
oxalate potassium perchloride.

753
00:54:08,982 --> 00:54:12,224
- Do you know what this means?
- No. What does it mean?

754
00:54:12,425 --> 00:54:14,343
It means it was home-made.

755
00:54:15,101 --> 00:54:17,901
I'm sorry. This is just coming
as quite a shock to me, sir.

756
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:20,826
Whoever set this dynamite
could have blown out

757
00:54:20,903 --> 00:54:23,703
your pilot light days before
the explosion.

758
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:26,504
- The gas was just a detonator.
- Who'd do such a thing?

759
00:54:26,581 --> 00:54:28,901
- I'll ask the questions.
- Tell him.

760
00:54:29,381 --> 00:54:33,064
The liberator who destroyed my property
realigned my perceptions.

761
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:34,541
Excuse me. Are you there?

762
00:54:34,627 --> 00:54:37,984
Yes, it's hard to know
what to make of this.

763
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:40,026
Have you recently made enemies

764
00:54:40,103 --> 00:54:42,223
who might have access
to home-made dynamite?

765
00:54:42,309 --> 00:54:44,783
- Enemies?
- I reject civilization,

766
00:54:44,869 --> 00:54:46,788
especially material possessions.

767
00:54:46,864 --> 00:54:49,387
- Son, this is serious.
- Yes, I know it's serious.

768
00:54:49,463 --> 00:54:52,187
- I mean that.
- Yes, it's very serious.

769
00:54:52,264 --> 00:54:57,826
Look, nobody takes this more seriously
than me. That condo was my life. OK?

770
00:54:58,344 --> 00:55:00,943
I loved every stick of
furniture in that place.

771
00:55:01,029 --> 00:55:04,108
That was not just a bunch of stuff
that got destroyed.

772
00:55:04,185 --> 00:55:06,582
- It was me!
<i>- I thank the Academy.</i>

773
00:55:06,668 --> 00:55:10,744
- Is this not a good time for you?
- Just tell him you fucking did it!

774
00:55:10,984 --> 00:55:14,907
Tell him you blew it all up!
That's what he wants to hear.

775
00:55:14,983 --> 00:55:18,704
- Are you still there?
- Wait. Are you saying that I'm a suspect?

776
00:55:18,781 --> 00:55:23,260
No. I may need to talk to you, so you
let me know if you're gonna leave town.

777
00:55:24,027 --> 00:55:25,389
- OK?
- OK.

778
00:55:28,861 --> 00:55:29,944
<i>Except for their humping,</i>

779
00:55:30,021 --> 00:55:32,745
<i>Tyler and Marla were never
in the same room.</i>

780
00:55:32,822 --> 00:55:35,382
<i>My parents pulled
this exact same act for years.</i>

781
00:55:35,468 --> 00:55:38,700
The condom is the glass slipper
of our generation.

782
00:55:39,621 --> 00:55:42,345
You slip one on when you meet a stranger.

783
00:55:42,508 --> 00:55:46,066
You dance all night,
then you throw it away.

784
00:55:47,025 --> 00:55:49,662
The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.

785
00:55:50,986 --> 00:55:52,022
What?

786
00:55:56,663 --> 00:55:59,387
I got this dress at a thrift store for $1.

787
00:55:59,464 --> 00:56:01,180
It was worth every penny.

788
00:56:01,267 --> 00:56:03,223
It's a bridesmaid's dress.

789
00:56:05,189 --> 00:56:08,987
Someone loved it intensely for one day,

790
00:56:10,147 --> 00:56:11,663
then tossed it.

791
00:56:13,226 --> 00:56:14,981
Like a Christmas tree.

792
00:56:15,508 --> 00:56:16,985
So special.

793
00:56:18,223 --> 00:56:20,102
Then... bam!

794
00:56:20,946 --> 00:56:23,066
It's on the side of the road.

795
00:56:23,584 --> 00:56:25,626
Tinsel still clinging to it.

796
00:56:27,506 --> 00:56:34,028
Like a sex-crime victim, underwear
inside out, bound with electrical tape.

797
00:56:34,507 --> 00:56:36,425
Well, then it suits you.

798
00:56:36,905 --> 00:56:38,947
You can borrow it sometime.

799
00:56:45,862 --> 00:56:47,301
Get rid of her.

800
00:56:48,106 --> 00:56:50,581
- What? You get rid of her!
- Don't mention me.

801
00:56:50,667 --> 00:56:54,704
<i>I am six years old again,
passing messages between parents.</i>

802
00:56:57,946 --> 00:57:00,583
- It's time you left.
- Don't worry, I'm leaving.

803
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:05,340
- Not that we don't love your visits.
- You are such a nutcase. I can't keep up.

804
00:57:07,066 --> 00:57:09,464
Gotta get off.

805
00:57:09,541 --> 00:57:10,500
Thanks. Bye.

806
00:57:10,586 --> 00:57:15,621
Gotta get off of this merry-go-round.

807
00:57:17,424 --> 00:57:21,864
Gonna get, need to get, gotta get...

808
00:57:25,384 --> 00:57:26,583
You kids!

809
00:57:27,983 --> 00:57:30,582
Why do you still waste time with her?

810
00:57:31,944 --> 00:57:34,946
I'll say this about Marla.
At least she's trying to hit bottom.

811
00:57:35,023 --> 00:57:36,384
And I'm not?

812
00:57:36,701 --> 00:57:40,268
Sticking feathers up your butt
does not make you a chicken.

813
00:57:40,585 --> 00:57:42,388
What are we doing tonight?

814
00:57:42,465 --> 00:57:44,421
Tonight we make soap.

815
00:57:45,505 --> 00:57:48,622
- Really?
- To make soap, first we render fat.

816
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:09,462
The salt balance has to be just right,

817
00:58:09,548 --> 00:58:12,502
so the best fat for soap
comes from humans.

818
00:58:13,221 --> 00:58:16,261
- Wait. What is this place?
- A liposuction clinic.

819
00:58:23,828 --> 00:58:25,506
Aha! Pay dirt!

820
00:58:26,341 --> 00:58:30,024
Richest, creamiest fat in the world.
The fat of the land!

821
00:58:35,461 --> 00:58:38,185
No! Don't pull it.

822
00:58:42,702 --> 00:58:45,023
- Oh, God!
- Give me another one.

823
00:58:52,062 --> 00:58:56,301
As the fat renders, the tallows float
to the surface. Like in Boy Scouts.

824
00:58:56,666 --> 00:59:00,109
- It's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout.
- Keep stirring.

825
00:59:02,382 --> 00:59:05,786
Once the tallow hardens,
you skim off a layer of glycerin.

826
00:59:05,863 --> 00:59:08,021
Add nitric acid, you got nitroglycerin.

827
00:59:08,107 --> 00:59:12,145
If you then add sodium nitrate
and sawdust, you got dynamite.

828
00:59:13,104 --> 00:59:15,741
With enough soap,
one could blow up anything.

829
00:59:15,827 --> 00:59:18,388
<i>Tyler was full of useful information.</i>

830
00:59:18,465 --> 00:59:21,908
Ancient peoples found clothes got cleaner
when washed in one part of the river.

831
00:59:21,984 --> 00:59:23,260
- You know why?
- No.

832
00:59:27,221 --> 00:59:29,944
Humans were once sacrificed
on the hills above.

833
00:59:30,021 --> 00:59:33,589
Bodies burned, water seeped
through the ashes to create lye.

834
00:59:34,107 --> 00:59:36,025
This is lye. The crucial ingredient.

835
00:59:36,101 --> 00:59:40,465
Once it mixed with the melted body fat,
a soapy discharge crept into the river.

836
00:59:40,542 --> 00:59:42,748
May I see your hand, please?

837
00:59:49,509 --> 00:59:50,784
What is this?

838
00:59:50,861 --> 00:59:53,546
This is a chemical burn.

839
00:59:53,623 --> 00:59:56,826
It'll hurt more than you've ever
been burned and leave a scar.

840
00:59:56,903 --> 00:59:59,301
<i>If meditation worked for cancer,
it could work for this.</i>

841
00:59:59,943 --> 01:00:02,264
- Don't shut the pain out.
- Oh, God!

842
01:00:04,182 --> 01:00:06,062
The first soap was made
from heroes' ashes,

843
01:00:06,148 --> 01:00:07,865
like the first monkey shot into space.

844
01:00:07,942 --> 01:00:10,943
Without pain or sacrifice,
we would have nothing.

845
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:13,667
<i>I tried not to think
of the words searing or flesh.</i>

846
01:00:13,744 --> 01:00:16,544
Stop it! This is your pain,
this is your burning hand.

847
01:00:16,621 --> 01:00:19,584
I'm going to my cave
to find my power animal.

848
01:00:19,661 --> 01:00:23,181
No! Don't deal with this
the way those dead people do! Come on!

849
01:00:23,267 --> 01:00:24,226
- I get the point!
- No!

850
01:00:24,303 --> 01:00:26,509
You're feeling premature enlightenment.

851
01:00:30,824 --> 01:00:33,500
It's the greatest moment of your life,
and you're missing it!

852
01:00:33,586 --> 01:00:35,063
I am not...

853
01:00:35,629 --> 01:00:38,420
Shut up! Our fathers
were our models for God.

854
01:00:38,506 --> 01:00:41,268
If our fathers bailed,
what does that tell you about God?

855
01:00:42,668 --> 01:00:47,780
Listen to me. You have to consider
the possibility that God does not like you.

856
01:00:47,905 --> 01:00:51,386
He never wanted you.
In all probability, he hates you.

857
01:00:51,463 --> 01:00:54,743
This is not the worst thing
that can happen. We don't need him!

858
01:00:54,829 --> 01:00:57,860
- I agree!
- Fuck damnation, fuck redemption.

859
01:00:57,946 --> 01:01:00,344
We are God's unwanted children? So be it!

860
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:04,228
- I'm getting water!
- You can use water and make it worse or...

861
01:01:04,304 --> 01:01:05,781
Look at me!

862
01:01:05,868 --> 01:01:08,860
- Or use vinegar to neutralize the burn.
- Please let me have it, please!

863
01:01:08,946 --> 01:01:11,104
First, you have to give up.

864
01:01:11,468 --> 01:01:13,866
First, you have to know, not fear,

865
01:01:14,106 --> 01:01:16,868
know that someday, you're gonna die.

866
01:01:16,945 --> 01:01:19,141
You don't know how this feels!

867
01:01:23,821 --> 01:01:27,705
It's only after we've lost everything
that we're free to do anything.

868
01:01:28,424 --> 01:01:29,460
OK.

869
01:01:44,421 --> 01:01:47,902
Congratulations.
You're one step closer to hitting bottom.

870
01:01:50,904 --> 01:01:54,424
<i>Tyler sold his soap to department stores
at $20 a bar.</i>

871
01:01:54,501 --> 01:01:55,949
<i>God knows what they charged.</i>

872
01:01:56,026 --> 01:01:59,708
- This is the best soap.
- Why, thank you, Susan.

873
01:02:00,101 --> 01:02:01,588
<i>It was beautiful.</i>

874
01:02:01,665 --> 01:02:05,223
<i>We were selling rich women
their own fat asses back to them.</i>

875
01:02:06,709 --> 01:02:08,666
<i>He was wearing his yellow tie.</i>

876
01:02:08,742 --> 01:02:10,862
<i>I didn't even wear a tie to work anymore.</i>

877
01:02:10,987 --> 01:02:14,583
The first rule of Fight Club
is don't talk about Fight Club?

878
01:02:14,669 --> 01:02:17,825
<i>I'm half-asleep again.
I must have left it in the copy machine.</i>

879
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:20,308
The second rule... Is this yours?

880
01:02:22,188 --> 01:02:25,142
Pretend you're me.
Make a managerial decision.

881
01:02:25,228 --> 01:02:27,540
You find this. What would you do?

882
01:02:32,306 --> 01:02:34,147
Well, I gotta tell you,

883
01:02:34,301 --> 01:02:37,466
I'd be very, very careful
who you talk to about that.

884
01:02:37,542 --> 01:02:40,861
Because the person who wrote that
is dangerous.

885
01:02:40,947 --> 01:02:45,224
And this button-down,
Oxford-cloth psycho might just snap

886
01:02:45,301 --> 01:02:48,063
and then stalk from office to office

887
01:02:48,149 --> 01:02:53,347
with an Armalite AR10 carbine
gas-powered semiautomatic weapon,

888
01:02:53,424 --> 01:02:56,905
pumping round after round
into colleagues and co-workers.

889
01:02:58,507 --> 01:03:01,346
This might be someone
you've known for years.

890
01:03:01,423 --> 01:03:04,549
Someone very, very close to you.

891
01:03:05,345 --> 01:03:08,107
<i>Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.</i>

892
01:03:09,306 --> 01:03:11,147
<i>And I used to be such a nice guy.</i>

893
01:03:11,224 --> 01:03:14,465
Or maybe you shouldn't bring me
every piece of trash you pick up.

894
01:03:18,024 --> 01:03:20,747
- Compliance and Liability.
- My tit's gonna rot off.

895
01:03:22,982 --> 01:03:25,581
Will you excuse me? I need to take this.

896
01:03:30,942 --> 01:03:31,949
What do you mean?

897
01:03:32,026 --> 01:03:34,903
I need you to check
for a lump in my breast.

898
01:03:34,989 --> 01:03:38,662
- Go to a hospital.
- I can't afford to waste money on a doctor.

899
01:03:39,343 --> 01:03:41,549
I don't know about this, Marla.

900
01:03:41,702 --> 01:03:43,064
Please?

901
01:03:43,141 --> 01:03:46,181
<i>She didn't call Tyler.
I'm neutral in her book.</i>

902
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:52,463
That's nice. Taking food to
Mrs. Haniver and Mrs. Raines.

903
01:03:52,702 --> 01:03:54,429
Where are they, exactly?

904
01:03:54,505 --> 01:03:58,907
Tragically, they're dead.
I'm alive and I'm in poverty. Want any?

905
01:03:58,984 --> 01:04:00,749
- No, no.
- I got one for you.

906
01:04:00,826 --> 01:04:02,667
Thanks for the thought.

907
01:04:03,942 --> 01:04:05,985
What happened to your hand?

908
01:04:06,465 --> 01:04:07,788
Oh, nothing.

909
01:04:09,188 --> 01:04:10,742
Right there?

910
01:04:11,624 --> 01:04:13,945
- Feel anything?
- No.

911
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:15,624
Well, make sure.

912
01:04:16,947 --> 01:04:19,949
- OK, I'm pretty sure.
- You feel nothing?

913
01:04:21,061 --> 01:04:22,423
No, nothing.

914
01:04:24,101 --> 01:04:26,509
Well, that's a relief. Thank you.

915
01:04:28,187 --> 01:04:31,227
- No problem.
- I wish I could return the favor.

916
01:04:31,304 --> 01:04:33,586
Breast cancer doesn't run in my family.

917
01:04:33,663 --> 01:04:36,300
- I could check your prostate.
- I think I'm OK.

918
01:04:37,221 --> 01:04:38,986
Well, thanks anyway.

919
01:04:43,666 --> 01:04:45,948
- Are we done?
- Yeah, we're done.

920
01:04:46,025 --> 01:04:48,145
See you around.

921
01:05:04,583 --> 01:05:06,462
Cornelius?

922
01:05:06,549 --> 01:05:09,023
Cornelius!

923
01:05:09,109 --> 01:05:11,382
It's me! Bob!

924
01:05:11,468 --> 01:05:12,907
Hey, Bob.

925
01:05:16,705 --> 01:05:19,707
- We all thought you were dead.
- No, no. Still here.

926
01:05:19,783 --> 01:05:21,625
How are you, Bob?

927
01:05:21,701 --> 01:05:23,341
Better than I've ever
been in my whole life.

928
01:05:23,428 --> 01:05:26,228
Really? Still Remaining Men Together?

929
01:05:26,343 --> 01:05:28,300
No, no.
I got something so much better now.

930
01:05:28,386 --> 01:05:31,023
Really, what is it?

931
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:32,903
Well...

932
01:05:32,989 --> 01:05:36,624
The first rule is,
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

933
01:05:37,785 --> 01:05:39,261
And the second rule is...

934
01:05:39,348 --> 01:05:40,940
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

935
01:05:41,026 --> 01:05:44,546
- And the third rule is...
- Bob, Bob. I'm a member.

936
01:05:45,390 --> 01:05:47,308
Look at my face, Bob.

937
01:05:49,226 --> 01:05:51,422
That's fucking great.

938
01:05:51,508 --> 01:05:54,625
- I've never seen you there.
- I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.

939
01:05:55,623 --> 01:05:58,663
- I go Saturday.
- Congratulations.

940
01:05:59,421 --> 01:06:01,147
Yeah, hey, to both of us, right?

941
01:06:01,224 --> 01:06:04,149
Have you heard about the guy
that invented it?

942
01:06:04,225 --> 01:06:06,824
- Yeah, actually...
- I hear all kinds of things.

943
01:06:06,901 --> 01:06:10,948
Supposedly, he was born
in a mental institution

944
01:06:11,025 --> 01:06:14,583
and he sleeps only one hour a night.

945
01:06:14,669 --> 01:06:16,667
He's a great man.

946
01:06:17,546 --> 01:06:19,781
Do you know about Tyler Durden?

947
01:06:43,949 --> 01:06:45,982
I didn't hurt you, did I?

948
01:06:46,068 --> 01:06:48,504
Actually, you did.

949
01:06:48,581 --> 01:06:52,024
Thank you for this.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

950
01:06:52,101 --> 01:06:54,460
<i>Fight Club.</i>

951
01:06:54,546 --> 01:06:56,186
<i>This was mine and Tyler's gift.</i>

952
01:06:56,905 --> 01:06:58,584
<i>Our gift to the world.</i>

953
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:02,027
I look around, I look around,
I see a lot of new faces.

954
01:07:03,868 --> 01:07:05,585
Shut up!

955
01:07:06,505 --> 01:07:11,147
Which means a lot of people have been
breaking the first two rules of Fight Club.

956
01:07:18,225 --> 01:07:22,742
I see in Fight Club the strongest
and smartest men who've ever lived.

957
01:07:22,828 --> 01:07:25,782
I see all this potential.
And I see it squandered.

958
01:07:27,863 --> 01:07:31,066
Goddamn it,
an entire generation pumping gas.

959
01:07:31,143 --> 01:07:32,860
Waiting tables.

960
01:07:32,946 --> 01:07:35,267
Slaves with white collars.

961
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:40,187
Advertising has us chasing
cars and clothes.

962
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:43,582
Working jobs we hate
so we can buy shit we don't need.

963
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:51,302
We're the middle children of history, men.
No purpose or place.

964
01:07:52,108 --> 01:07:54,103
We have no Great War.

965
01:07:54,189 --> 01:07:56,107
No Great Depression.

966
01:07:57,747 --> 01:08:00,547
Our great war is a spiritual war.

967
01:08:00,624 --> 01:08:03,185
Our great depression is our lives.

968
01:08:07,462 --> 01:08:10,665
We've all been raised on TV to believe
that one day we'd be millionaires

969
01:08:10,742 --> 01:08:13,025
and movie gods and rock stars.

970
01:08:13,101 --> 01:08:14,943
But we won't.

971
01:08:15,029 --> 01:08:17,868
We're slowly learning that fact.

972
01:08:17,944 --> 01:08:20,745
And we're very, very pissed off.

973
01:08:20,822 --> 01:08:22,740
Yeah!

974
01:08:25,224 --> 01:08:28,024
First rule of Fight Club is, do not talk...

975
01:08:34,143 --> 01:08:36,022
Who are you?

976
01:08:36,109 --> 01:08:38,583
- Who am I?
- Yeah.

977
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:43,148
There's a sign on the front
that says Lou's Tavern.

978
01:08:43,225 --> 01:08:47,387
I'm fucking Lou. Who the fuck are you?

979
01:08:47,464 --> 01:08:48,989
Tyler Durden.

980
01:08:51,904 --> 01:08:54,704
Who told you motherfuckers
you could use my place?

981
01:08:54,781 --> 01:08:57,668
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.

982
01:08:57,745 --> 01:09:02,060
Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.
He don't own this place. I do.

983
01:09:04,822 --> 01:09:07,623
- How much money does he get?
- There is no money.

984
01:09:07,709 --> 01:09:09,387
- Really?
- Free to all.

985
01:09:09,464 --> 01:09:12,504
- Ain't that something.
- It is actually.

986
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:14,547
Look, stupid fuck!

987
01:09:14,624 --> 01:09:19,429
- I want everybody out of here right now.
- Hey! You should join our club.

988
01:09:20,503 --> 01:09:23,620
- Did you hear what I just said?
- You and your friend.

989
01:09:26,784 --> 01:09:28,261
You hear me now?

990
01:09:29,863 --> 01:09:31,781
No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou.

991
01:09:38,226 --> 01:09:40,901
Still not getting it.

992
01:09:40,988 --> 01:09:42,628
OK, OK, I got it.

993
01:09:42,704 --> 01:09:45,064
I got it, I got it. Shit, I lost it.

994
01:09:46,502 --> 01:09:48,545
Back! All of you!

995
01:09:49,466 --> 01:09:51,384
Everybody back!

996
01:09:58,701 --> 01:10:00,025
Ah, Lou!

997
01:10:01,108 --> 01:10:04,666
Come on, man! We really like this place.

998
01:10:13,701 --> 01:10:16,185
- That's right, Lou. Get it out.
- Shut the fuck up.

999
01:10:16,261 --> 01:10:17,786
Oh, yeah!

1000
01:10:22,188 --> 01:10:24,145
That's fucking funny?

1001
01:10:33,102 --> 01:10:35,701
Fucking guy's a loony, I'm telling you.

1002
01:10:36,746 --> 01:10:38,348
Unbelievable.

1003
01:10:42,664 --> 01:10:44,946
- You don't know where I've been, Lou.
- Oh, my God!

1004
01:10:46,068 --> 01:10:48,341
You don't know where I've been!

1005
01:10:51,468 --> 01:10:54,268
Please let us keep it, Lou! Please, Lou!

1006
01:10:54,345 --> 01:10:59,140
- Fucking use the basement! Christ!
- I want your word, Lou! I want your word!

1007
01:10:59,226 --> 01:11:00,905
On my mother's eyes.

1008
01:11:10,188 --> 01:11:11,502
Thanks, Lou.

1009
01:11:13,785 --> 01:11:15,463
You too, big guy.

1010
01:11:19,347 --> 01:11:21,227
We'll see you next week.

1011
01:11:36,264 --> 01:11:39,746
This week, each one of you
has a homework assignment.

1012
01:11:41,021 --> 01:11:45,107
You're gonna go out. You're gonna
start a fight with a total stranger.

1013
01:11:47,629 --> 01:11:49,662
You're gonna start a fight,

1014
01:11:50,228 --> 01:11:52,022
and you're gonna lose.

1015
01:11:54,668 --> 01:11:56,702
Excellent choice, sir.

1016
01:11:58,025 --> 01:12:00,624
Hey! Watch out, jackass! Come on!

1017
01:12:00,902 --> 01:12:03,223
<i>Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.</i>

1018
01:12:06,589 --> 01:12:08,383
What... Son of a bitch!

1019
01:12:08,661 --> 01:12:12,948
<i>Most people, normal people,
do just about anything to avoid a fight.</i>

1020
01:12:14,588 --> 01:12:16,026
Excuse me!

1021
01:12:16,103 --> 01:12:18,261
You sprayed me with your hose.

1022
01:12:18,347 --> 01:12:19,786
That's not necessary.

1023
01:12:19,862 --> 01:12:21,464
Jay! Go call 911!

1024
01:12:24,188 --> 01:12:25,300
Put the hose down.

1025
01:12:26,029 --> 01:12:27,784
Stop it! Stop it!

1026
01:12:30,949 --> 01:12:32,148
Sorry.

1027
01:12:39,628 --> 01:12:40,664
You bastard!

1028
01:12:46,668 --> 01:12:48,221
We need to talk.

1029
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:51,942
OK.

1030
01:12:53,822 --> 01:12:54,983
Where to begin?

1031
01:12:55,146 --> 01:12:57,620
With your constant absenteeism?

1032
01:12:57,706 --> 01:13:00,468
With your unpresentable appearance?

1033
01:13:00,583 --> 01:13:05,100
- You're up for review.
- I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.

1034
01:13:05,187 --> 01:13:07,066
- What?
- Let's pretend.

1035
01:13:07,143 --> 01:13:09,905
You're the Department
of Transportation, OK?

1036
01:13:10,509 --> 01:13:15,381
Someone informs you that this company
installs front-seat mounting brackets

1037
01:13:15,506 --> 01:13:17,549
that never pass collision tests,

1038
01:13:17,626 --> 01:13:20,666
brake linings that fail after 1,000 miles,

1039
01:13:20,742 --> 01:13:24,425
and fuel injectors
that explode and burn people alive.

1040
01:13:25,864 --> 01:13:27,149
What then?

1041
01:13:27,743 --> 01:13:29,988
- Are you threatening me?
- No...

1042
01:13:30,064 --> 01:13:33,267
- Get the fuck out of here. You're fired!
- I have a better solution.

1043
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:36,624
Keep me on the payroll
as an outside consultant

1044
01:13:37,142 --> 01:13:38,581
and, in exchange for my salary,

1045
01:13:38,667 --> 01:13:42,388
my job will be never to tell people
these things that I know.

1046
01:13:43,261 --> 01:13:47,701
I don't even have to come into the office.
I can do this job from home.

1047
01:13:47,787 --> 01:13:51,863
Who... Who the fuck do you think you are,
you crazy little shit?

1048
01:13:56,390 --> 01:14:00,025
- Security!
<i>- I am Jack's smirking revenge.</i>

1049
01:14:09,021 --> 01:14:10,824
What the hell are you doing?

1050
01:14:19,503 --> 01:14:20,826
That hurt.

1051
01:14:23,349 --> 01:14:25,382
Why would you do that?

1052
01:14:25,583 --> 01:14:28,105
Oh, my God! No! Please stop!

1053
01:14:38,185 --> 01:14:39,940
What are you doing?

1054
01:14:40,429 --> 01:14:42,386
Oh, God, no! Please! No!

1055
01:14:42,501 --> 01:14:45,905
<i>For some reason,
I thought of my first fight, with Tyler.</i>

1056
01:14:46,222 --> 01:14:47,344
No!

1057
01:15:11,387 --> 01:15:15,827
<i>Under and behind and inside
everything this man took for granted,</i>

1058
01:15:15,904 --> 01:15:18,666
<i>something horrible had been growing.</i>

1059
01:15:19,146 --> 01:15:22,502
Look. Just give me the paychecks,
like I asked,

1060
01:15:22,589 --> 01:15:24,785
and you won't ever see me again.

1061
01:15:24,909 --> 01:15:28,065
<i>And right then,
at our most excellent moment together...</i>

1062
01:15:31,508 --> 01:15:33,944
Thank God! Please don't hit me again.

1063
01:15:34,183 --> 01:15:36,380
<i>Telephone, computer, fax machine,</i>

1064
01:15:36,466 --> 01:15:40,503
<i>52 weekly paychecks
and 48 airline flight coupons.</i>

1065
01:15:40,590 --> 01:15:42,987
<i>We now had corporate sponsorship.</i>

1066
01:15:43,064 --> 01:15:46,507
<i>This is how Tyler and I were able to have
Fight Club every night of the week.</i>

1067
01:15:49,307 --> 01:15:53,383
<i>Now, nobody was the center of Fight Club
except the two men fighting.</i>

1068
01:15:54,227 --> 01:15:57,267
<i>The leader walked through the crowd,
out in the darkness.</i>

1069
01:15:58,984 --> 01:16:02,302
<i>Tyler was now involved in a lawsuit
with the Pressman Hotel</i>

1070
01:16:02,389 --> 01:16:04,345
<i>over the urine content of their soup.</i>

1071
01:16:10,464 --> 01:16:12,344
<i>I am Jack's wasted life.</i>

1072
01:16:20,543 --> 01:16:22,020
Thank you, sir.

1073
01:16:24,428 --> 01:16:26,940
<i>Tyler dreamed up
new homework assignments.</i>

1074
01:16:27,027 --> 01:16:29,702
<i>He handed them out in sealed envelopes.</i>

1075
01:17:07,709 --> 01:17:10,586
- There's a Fight Club in Delaware City.
- Yeah, I heard.

1076
01:17:12,428 --> 01:17:16,820
There's one in Penns Grove too.
Bob even found one up in New Castle.

1077
01:17:16,906 --> 01:17:19,505
- Did you start that one?
- No, I thought you did.

1078
01:17:19,582 --> 01:17:20,627
No.

1079
01:18:09,462 --> 01:18:11,226
- Stop.
- What are we doing?

1080
01:18:11,303 --> 01:18:12,943
- Turn around.
- What are we doing?

1081
01:18:13,029 --> 01:18:15,542
- Homework assignment.
- What kind?

1082
01:18:15,628 --> 01:18:17,182
Human sacrifice.

1083
01:18:17,585 --> 01:18:22,227
- Is that a gun? Please tell me it's not.
- It's a gun. Meet me in the back.

1084
01:18:22,303 --> 01:18:24,902
- Don't fuck around!
- Meet me in the back.

1085
01:18:25,545 --> 01:18:27,703
<i>On a long enough time line,</i>

1086
01:18:27,789 --> 01:18:30,340
<i>the survival rate for everyone
drops to zero.</i>

1087
01:18:31,702 --> 01:18:34,828
- Stop. What are you doing?
- Hands behind your back.

1088
01:18:35,183 --> 01:18:36,900
Give me your wallet.

1089
01:18:38,588 --> 01:18:41,781
Raymond K Hessel.
1320 SE Banning, Apartment A.

1090
01:18:41,906 --> 01:18:43,460
Cramped basement apartment?

1091
01:18:43,546 --> 01:18:46,941
- How did you know?
- They give shitty apartments letters.

1092
01:18:47,670 --> 01:18:50,585
Raymond! You're going to die.

1093
01:18:50,662 --> 01:18:51,784
No!

1094
01:18:52,868 --> 01:18:54,067
Is that your mom and dad?

1095
01:18:54,143 --> 01:18:56,541
They're gonna have to call
the kindly doctor.

1096
01:18:56,627 --> 01:18:58,660
Pick up your dental records. Know why?

1097
01:18:58,747 --> 01:19:01,940
- There'll be nothing left of your face.
- Come on!

1098
01:19:02,343 --> 01:19:06,381
An expired community college student ID.
What did you study, Raymond?

1099
01:19:06,822 --> 01:19:09,220
- Stuff.
- Stuff?

1100
01:19:09,306 --> 01:19:11,147
Were the midterms hard?

1101
01:19:12,384 --> 01:19:14,983
- I asked you what you studied!
- Biology, mostly.

1102
01:19:15,070 --> 01:19:18,062
- Why?
- I don't know.

1103
01:19:18,148 --> 01:19:20,747
What did you wanna be,
Raymond K Hessel?

1104
01:19:22,426 --> 01:19:26,425
The question, Raymond, was
what did you want to be?

1105
01:19:28,304 --> 01:19:29,666
Answer him, Raymond! Jesus!

1106
01:19:29,743 --> 01:19:32,189
- Veterinarian. Veterinarian.
- Animals.

1107
01:19:32,265 --> 01:19:34,826
- Yeah. Animal and stuff.
- Stuff. Yeah, I got that.

1108
01:19:34,903 --> 01:19:37,866
- So you need more schooling.
- Too much school.

1109
01:19:38,029 --> 01:19:39,909
- Would you rather be dead?
- No, please...

1110
01:19:39,986 --> 01:19:44,148
You'd rather die here, on your knees,
in the back of a convenience store?

1111
01:19:44,944 --> 01:19:46,948
No. Please, no.

1112
01:19:50,621 --> 01:19:52,549
I'm keeping your license.

1113
01:19:53,067 --> 01:19:55,867
Gonna check in on you.
I know where you live.

1114
01:19:57,181 --> 01:19:59,780
If you're not on your way to being
a veterinarian in six weeks,

1115
01:19:59,866 --> 01:20:01,065
you will be dead.

1116
01:20:03,588 --> 01:20:05,141
Now run on home.

1117
01:20:09,745 --> 01:20:11,624
Run, Forrest, run!

1118
01:20:13,101 --> 01:20:14,425
I feel ill.

1119
01:20:16,621 --> 01:20:19,661
- Imagine how he feels.
- Come on, this isn't funny!

1120
01:20:19,747 --> 01:20:22,826
What the fuck was the point of that?

1121
01:20:22,903 --> 01:20:26,422
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day
of Raymond K Hessel's life.

1122
01:20:26,509 --> 01:20:30,786
His breakfast will taste better
than any meal you and I have ever tasted.

1123
01:20:31,985 --> 01:20:34,181
<i>You had to give it to him.</i>

1124
01:20:34,469 --> 01:20:36,425
- Come on.
<i>- He had a plan.</i>

1125
01:20:36,502 --> 01:20:39,667
<i>And it started to make sense
in a Tyler sort of way.</i>

1126
01:20:39,743 --> 01:20:42,908
<i>No fear. No distractions.</i>

1127
01:20:42,985 --> 01:20:46,946
<i>The ability to let that
which does not matter truly slide.</i>

1128
01:20:59,787 --> 01:21:01,629
<i>You are not your job.</i>

1129
01:21:03,748 --> 01:21:05,743
You're not how much money
you have in the bank.

1130
01:21:08,505 --> 01:21:10,663
You're not the car you drive.

1131
01:21:11,066 --> 01:21:13,866
You're not the contents of your wallet.

1132
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:17,261
You're not your fucking khakis.

1133
01:21:18,824 --> 01:21:21,423
You are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.

1134
01:21:30,707 --> 01:21:33,028
I'll be out of your way in a sec.

1135
01:21:33,824 --> 01:21:35,588
You don't have to go.

1136
01:21:37,190 --> 01:21:38,389
Whatever.

1137
01:21:39,866 --> 01:21:43,146
No, I mean it's OK.

1138
01:21:52,304 --> 01:21:54,462
Are you still going to groups?

1139
01:21:55,383 --> 01:21:56,428
Yeah.

1140
01:21:58,548 --> 01:22:00,341
Chloe's dead.

1141
01:22:00,428 --> 01:22:01,741
Wow. Chloe.

1142
01:22:03,381 --> 01:22:05,626
When did that happen?

1143
01:22:05,702 --> 01:22:07,064
Do you care?

1144
01:22:08,023 --> 01:22:10,785
I dunno.
I haven't thought about it in a while.

1145
01:22:10,862 --> 01:22:12,262
Yeah, well...

1146
01:22:13,106 --> 01:22:15,465
It was the smart move on her part.

1147
01:22:17,508 --> 01:22:18,908
Listen...

1148
01:22:19,781 --> 01:22:22,380
What are you getting out of all this?

1149
01:22:22,466 --> 01:22:23,502
What?

1150
01:22:24,586 --> 01:22:27,463
I mean, all this. Why do you keep...

1151
01:22:27,549 --> 01:22:29,467
Is this making you happy?

1152
01:22:31,309 --> 01:22:33,064
Yeah, well, sometimes.

1153
01:22:34,982 --> 01:22:36,507
I don't know. I don't understand.

1154
01:22:36,583 --> 01:22:42,424
Why does a weaker person need to latch
on to a strong person? What is that?

1155
01:22:42,501 --> 01:22:44,428
What do you get out of it?

1156
01:22:46,346 --> 01:22:50,863
No, that's not the same thing at all.
It's totally different with us.

1157
01:22:50,950 --> 01:22:51,909
Us?

1158
01:22:53,021 --> 01:22:56,426
- What do you mean by us?
- I'm sorry. Do you hear this?

1159
01:22:56,541 --> 01:22:59,188
- Hear what?
- All that noise. Hold on.

1160
01:22:59,341 --> 01:23:02,621
No, wait! Don't change the subject!
I want to talk about this.

1161
01:23:02,708 --> 01:23:05,383
- You're not talking about me, are you?
- No.

1162
01:23:05,470 --> 01:23:08,587
- What?
- You playing doctor. What was going on?

1163
01:23:08,989 --> 01:23:11,905
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Nothing.

1164
01:23:11,982 --> 01:23:13,900
- I don't think so.
- What do you want?

1165
01:23:13,986 --> 01:23:15,942
- Look at me.
- No. What?

1166
01:23:17,707 --> 01:23:20,344
- What is that?
- It's nothing. Don't worry.

1167
01:23:20,421 --> 01:23:23,222
- My God. Who did this?
- A person.

1168
01:23:23,346 --> 01:23:24,660
Guy or girl?

1169
01:23:24,746 --> 01:23:27,269
- What do you care?
- What do you care if I ask?

1170
01:23:27,345 --> 01:23:28,909
- Leave me alone.
- You're afraid to say.

1171
01:23:28,985 --> 01:23:31,584
- I am not. Let me go.
- No! Talk to me.

1172
01:23:31,661 --> 01:23:33,387
Let go of me. Leave me alone!

1173
01:23:33,464 --> 01:23:35,382
- This conversation...
- This conversation...

1174
01:23:35,468 --> 01:23:37,866
- is over.
- is over.

1175
01:23:39,784 --> 01:23:42,105
I just can't win with you, can I?

1176
01:23:50,228 --> 01:23:51,743
Hey, this is getting a little old!

1177
01:23:54,429 --> 01:23:56,107
What is... What is all this?

1178
01:23:56,184 --> 01:23:57,862
What do you think?

1179
01:23:59,224 --> 01:24:01,142
Hey, why do we need bunk beds?

1180
01:24:01,228 --> 01:24:02,389
Hey!

1181
01:24:09,821 --> 01:24:11,826
Too young. Sorry.

1182
01:24:13,581 --> 01:24:15,106
What's all that?

1183
01:24:15,182 --> 01:24:18,625
Tell the applicant
if he's too young, too old or too fat.

1184
01:24:18,702 --> 01:24:19,862
Applicant?

1185
01:24:19,949 --> 01:24:23,382
If the applicant waits three days
without food or shelter,

1186
01:24:23,468 --> 01:24:25,828
he may enter and begin training.

1187
01:24:25,904 --> 01:24:27,583
Training for what?

1188
01:24:33,021 --> 01:24:34,824
You think this is a game?

1189
01:24:34,910 --> 01:24:37,068
You're too young to train here,
end of story.

1190
01:24:37,144 --> 01:24:39,628
Quit wasting our time.
Get the fuck out of here.

1191
01:24:44,069 --> 01:24:46,668
Bad news, friend.

1192
01:24:46,744 --> 01:24:49,267
It's not gonna happen.

1193
01:24:49,343 --> 01:24:51,223
Sorry if there was a misunderstanding.

1194
01:24:51,309 --> 01:24:54,426
It's not the end of the world.
Just go away.

1195
01:24:55,865 --> 01:24:57,025
Go.

1196
01:24:57,821 --> 01:25:01,140
You're trespassing
and I will have to call the police.

1197
01:25:04,909 --> 01:25:09,263
Don't you look at me!
You're never getting in this fucking house!

1198
01:25:09,349 --> 01:25:12,543
Never. Now get the fuck off my porch!
Get off my porch!

1199
01:25:12,629 --> 01:25:15,659
<i>Sooner or later,
we all became what Tyler wanted us to be.</i>

1200
01:25:15,746 --> 01:25:18,824
I'm gonna go inside
and I'm gonna get a shovel.

1201
01:25:26,343 --> 01:25:29,988
Got two black shirts?
Two pair of black pants?

1202
01:25:30,103 --> 01:25:32,980
- Yes, sir.
- One pair black boots? Black socks?

1203
01:25:33,066 --> 01:25:34,466
- Sir.
- One black jacket?

1204
01:25:34,543 --> 01:25:36,662
- Sir.
- $300 personal burial money?

1205
01:25:36,749 --> 01:25:38,504
Yes, sir.

1206
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:41,745
All right.

1207
01:25:52,103 --> 01:25:53,983
You're too old, fat man.

1208
01:25:54,827 --> 01:25:57,541
Your tits are too big.
Get the fuck off my porch.

1209
01:26:05,021 --> 01:26:06,345
Bob! Bob!

1210
01:26:22,025 --> 01:26:25,142
Like a monkey ready to be shot into space.

1211
01:26:25,267 --> 01:26:26,907
Space monkey.

1212
01:26:27,348 --> 01:26:30,541
Ready to sacrifice himself
for the greater good.

1213
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:38,741
You are too fucking old, fatty!

1214
01:26:38,866 --> 01:26:43,460
And you... You're too fucking blond!

1215
01:26:43,623 --> 01:26:45,905
Get out of here, the both of you!

1216
01:26:46,586 --> 01:26:47,862
<i>And so it went.</i>

1217
01:26:47,948 --> 01:26:49,626
<i>Listen up, maggots.</i>

1218
01:26:50,307 --> 01:26:52,503
<i>You are not special.</i>

1219
01:26:52,590 --> 01:26:55,582
<i>You are not
a beautiful or unique snowflake.</i>

1220
01:26:56,426 --> 01:26:59,581
<i>You are the same decaying organic matter
as everything else.</i>

1221
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:02,382
<i>Tyler built himself an army.</i>

1222
01:27:02,468 --> 01:27:06,505
<i>We are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.</i>

1223
01:27:06,582 --> 01:27:09,383
<i>We are all part of the same compost heap.</i>

1224
01:27:11,627 --> 01:27:14,264
<i>Why was Tyler Durden building an army?</i>

1225
01:27:14,341 --> 01:27:17,822
<i>To what purpose? For what greater good?</i>

1226
01:27:21,390 --> 01:27:23,222
<i>In Tyler we trusted.</i>

1227
01:27:27,624 --> 01:27:32,860
When he was like,
you are not your job, I was like, yeah!

1228
01:27:35,670 --> 01:27:37,703
- Hey, what's all this?
- Hey!

1229
01:27:40,302 --> 01:27:42,220
OK!

1230
01:27:42,306 --> 01:27:44,301
- What's going on?
- We're celebrating.

1231
01:27:44,388 --> 01:27:46,545
- What are we celebrating?
- Go on.

1232
01:27:50,909 --> 01:27:53,182
- Hey.
- Let me get that for you.

1233
01:27:57,469 --> 01:28:00,586
Same great taste.
Pepsi. Generation Next.

1234
01:28:04,029 --> 01:28:08,344
Investigators are on the scene.
The Police Commissioner has arrived.

1235
01:28:08,623 --> 01:28:11,787
Could you tell us
what you think has happened here?

1236
01:28:11,864 --> 01:28:15,624
We believe this is one of many
recent acts of vandalism around the city

1237
01:28:15,710 --> 01:28:18,827
somehow related to
underground boxing clubs.

1238
01:28:19,306 --> 01:28:22,500
We will be coordinating
a rigorous investigation.

1239
01:28:23,382 --> 01:28:26,422
That was Commissioner Jacobs
who just arrived on the scene

1240
01:28:26,509 --> 01:28:31,822
- of a four-alarm fire that broke out...
- She's hot.

1241
01:28:32,023 --> 01:28:33,980
Back to you in the studio.

1242
01:28:34,306 --> 01:28:35,821
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1243
01:28:37,269 --> 01:28:39,389
- Holy shit!
- Yeah!

1244
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:47,982
What the fuck did you guys do?

1245
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:50,667
Arson investigators
are on the premises...

1246
01:28:56,747 --> 01:29:00,900
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions, sir.

1247
01:29:06,827 --> 01:29:10,500
The victory in the war against crime
will not come overnight.

1248
01:29:10,749 --> 01:29:15,027
It will take dedication and commitment
and, most of all, cooperation.

1249
01:29:15,266 --> 01:29:18,585
Streets are safer now.
There is hope in the inner city.

1250
01:29:19,064 --> 01:29:21,864
- However...
- I gotta take a piss.

1251
01:29:22,660 --> 01:29:26,103
These are the first steps
in a long journey.

1252
01:29:26,190 --> 01:29:27,427
That is why we have
created Project Hope...

1253
01:29:27,504 --> 01:29:28,789
Bob.

1254
01:29:28,865 --> 01:29:31,906
Helping others
with prevention and enforcement.

1255
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:34,859
Project Hope will be a joint effort

1256
01:29:34,946 --> 01:29:37,228
between the police
and community leaders.

1257
01:29:37,861 --> 01:29:41,381
It will be a powerful new weapon
in the war against crime.

1258
01:30:26,389 --> 01:30:30,628
- Wrap it around the top of his Hacky Sack.
- Man! His balls are ice-cold.

1259
01:30:31,462 --> 01:30:34,464
Hi. You're gonna call off
your rigorous investigation.

1260
01:30:34,541 --> 01:30:37,188
You will publicly state
there is no underground group

1261
01:30:37,264 --> 01:30:40,669
or these guys are gonna take your balls.

1262
01:30:40,746 --> 01:30:45,224
They'll send one to the New York Times
and one to the LA Times.

1263
01:30:45,301 --> 01:30:48,869
Look, the people you are after
are the people you depend on.

1264
01:30:48,945 --> 01:30:52,782
We cook your meals. We haul your trash.
We connect your calls.

1265
01:30:52,906 --> 01:30:56,464
We drive your ambulances.
We guard you while you sleep.

1266
01:31:00,742 --> 01:31:02,468
Do not fuck with us.

1267
01:31:11,703 --> 01:31:13,027
Ball check!

1268
01:31:27,307 --> 01:31:28,947
Bob, this way.

1269
01:31:29,944 --> 01:31:31,345
Let's go.

1270
01:31:32,505 --> 01:31:35,382
<i>I am Jack's inflamed sense of rejection.</i>

1271
01:31:35,862 --> 01:31:36,869
Hey!

1272
01:31:51,906 --> 01:31:53,105
Yeah!

1273
01:32:24,303 --> 01:32:29,184
<i>I felt like putting a bullet in every panda
that wouldn't screw to save its species.</i>

1274
01:32:32,263 --> 01:32:34,900
<i>I wanted to open
the dump valves on oil tankers</i>

1275
01:32:34,987 --> 01:32:38,103
<i>and smother all those French beaches
I'd never see.</i>

1276
01:32:42,227 --> 01:32:44,462
<i>I wanted to breathe smoke.</i>

1277
01:33:00,583 --> 01:33:02,828
Where did you go, psycho boy?

1278
01:33:04,189 --> 01:33:06,980
I felt like destroying something beautiful.

1279
01:33:10,989 --> 01:33:13,463
- Get him to a fucking hospital.
- Yeah.

1280
01:33:24,905 --> 01:33:28,261
Don't worry, Mr. Durden.
Airport parking. Long term.

1281
01:33:29,230 --> 01:33:30,947
After you, Mr. Durden.

1282
01:33:32,347 --> 01:33:33,622
After you.

1283
01:33:50,904 --> 01:33:53,580
- Something on your mind, dear?
- No.

1284
01:33:53,666 --> 01:33:56,304
Yeah. Why wasn't I told
about Project Mayhem?

1285
01:33:56,390 --> 01:34:00,188
First rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions.

1286
01:34:00,264 --> 01:34:03,707
- Why wasn't I included in the beginning?
- Fight Club was the beginning.

1287
01:34:03,784 --> 01:34:06,863
Now it's left the basements
and it's Project Mayhem.

1288
01:34:06,949 --> 01:34:09,701
We started Fight Club
together. Remember?

1289
01:34:09,788 --> 01:34:11,466
It's as much mine as it is yours.

1290
01:34:11,581 --> 01:34:15,427
- Is this about you and me?
- Yeah. Weren't we doing this together?

1291
01:34:15,504 --> 01:34:17,546
This does not belong to us.

1292
01:34:17,623 --> 01:34:20,424
- We are not special.
- Fuck that. You should have told me.

1293
01:34:22,188 --> 01:34:23,186
Hey, Tyler!

1294
01:34:25,785 --> 01:34:27,789
- Goddamn it, Tyler!
- What do you want?

1295
01:34:27,866 --> 01:34:30,944
A statement of purpose?
Should I email you?

1296
01:34:31,021 --> 01:34:33,543
- Look...
- You decide your level of involvement!

1297
01:34:33,630 --> 01:34:35,787
I will! I wanna know certain things first!

1298
01:34:35,864 --> 01:34:38,185
- The first rule of Project Mayhem...
- Shut up!

1299
01:34:39,950 --> 01:34:43,460
- I wanna know what you're thinking.
- Fuck what you know!

1300
01:34:44,102 --> 01:34:47,229
Forget about what you think you know
about life, friendship,

1301
01:34:47,305 --> 01:34:49,703
and especially about you and me.

1302
01:34:50,902 --> 01:34:53,424
What is that supposed to mean? What...

1303
01:34:55,783 --> 01:34:57,701
What are you doing?

1304
01:34:59,341 --> 01:35:01,221
What'll you wish you'd done
before you die?

1305
01:35:01,307 --> 01:35:03,820
- Paint a self-portrait.
- Build a house.

1306
01:35:04,146 --> 01:35:06,582
- And you?
- I don't know. Nothing.

1307
01:35:06,668 --> 01:35:08,826
- Get in the right lane.
- You have to know!

1308
01:35:08,903 --> 01:35:11,588
If you died now,
how would you feel about your life?

1309
01:35:11,665 --> 01:35:15,866
I don't know! Nothing good.
Is that what you want to hear me say?

1310
01:35:15,942 --> 01:35:17,621
- Come on!
- Not good enough.

1311
01:35:17,707 --> 01:35:19,788
Stop fucking around! Tyler!

1312
01:35:22,790 --> 01:35:24,344
Jesus Christ!

1313
01:35:24,430 --> 01:35:26,741
Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Fuck you!

1314
01:35:26,828 --> 01:35:30,549
Fuck Fight Club. Fuck Marla!
I am sick of all your shit!

1315
01:35:31,987 --> 01:35:33,944
OK, man. OK.

1316
01:35:34,788 --> 01:35:36,907
- Quit screwing around. Steer!
- Look at you!

1317
01:35:37,060 --> 01:35:40,101
- Steer!
- Look at you! You're fucking pathetic!

1318
01:35:40,187 --> 01:35:44,627
- Why? Why? What are you talking about?
- Why do you think I blew up your condo?

1319
01:35:45,586 --> 01:35:46,747
What?

1320
01:35:46,824 --> 01:35:50,343
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat.
It's not a goddamn seminar.

1321
01:35:51,149 --> 01:35:54,189
Stop trying to control everything
and just let go!

1322
01:35:57,143 --> 01:35:59,349
- Let go!
- All right. Fine.

1323
01:36:00,864 --> 01:36:01,948
Fine.

1324
01:36:58,704 --> 01:37:01,025
<i>I'd never been in a car accident.</i>

1325
01:37:02,185 --> 01:37:04,180
<i>This must have been
what all those people felt like</i>

1326
01:37:04,266 --> 01:37:07,268
<i>before I filed them
as statistics in my reports.</i>

1327
01:37:08,026 --> 01:37:09,186
Goddamn!

1328
01:37:13,185 --> 01:37:15,707
We've just had a near-life experience!

1329
01:37:20,867 --> 01:37:25,547
In the world I see, you're stalking elk
through the Grand Canyon forests

1330
01:37:25,624 --> 01:37:28,223
around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.

1331
01:37:30,266 --> 01:37:34,505
You'll wear leather clothes
that will last you the rest of your life.

1332
01:37:34,869 --> 01:37:38,629
You'll climb the thick kudzu vines
that wrap the Sears Tower.

1333
01:37:39,904 --> 01:37:43,587
And when you look down,
you'll see tiny figures pounding corn,

1334
01:37:44,229 --> 01:37:45,428
laying strips of venison

1335
01:37:45,505 --> 01:37:49,466
in the empty car-pool lane
of some abandoned superhighway.

1336
01:38:02,029 --> 01:38:03,746
Feel better, champ.

1337
01:38:21,383 --> 01:38:22,744
<i>And then...</i>

1338
01:38:22,821 --> 01:38:24,183
Tyler?

1339
01:38:24,269 --> 01:38:25,861
<i>Tyler was gone.</i>

1340
01:38:33,984 --> 01:38:35,385
<i>Was I asleep?</i>

1341
01:38:37,341 --> 01:38:38,664
<i>Had I slept?</i>

1342
01:38:38,741 --> 01:38:41,187
You are not
a beautiful, unique snowflake...

1343
01:38:41,263 --> 01:38:44,189
<i>The house had become a living thing,</i>

1344
01:38:44,265 --> 01:38:47,468
<i>wet inside from so many people
sweating and breathing.</i>

1345
01:38:47,545 --> 01:38:49,060
We are all part
of the same compost heap...

1346
01:38:49,147 --> 01:38:53,108
<i>So many people moving, the house moved.</i>

1347
01:38:54,230 --> 01:38:56,023
<i>Planet Tyler.</i>

1348
01:38:56,109 --> 01:39:00,627
<i>I had to hug the walls, trapped inside
this clockwork of space monkeys.</i>

1349
01:39:00,905 --> 01:39:03,945
You can't be smoking!
You know how much ether is in here?

1350
01:39:04,022 --> 01:39:06,745
<i>Cooking and working
and sleeping in teams.</i>

1351
01:39:09,862 --> 01:39:11,464
Hang on a second.

1352
01:39:30,424 --> 01:39:31,862
It's under control, sir.

1353
01:39:34,989 --> 01:39:36,466
Where's Tyler?

1354
01:39:36,543 --> 01:39:39,228
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not...

1355
01:39:39,305 --> 01:39:41,386
Right. OK.

1356
01:39:43,630 --> 01:39:45,068
<i>I'm all alone.</i>

1357
01:39:45,625 --> 01:39:48,866
<i>My father dumped me. Tyler dumped me.</i>

1358
01:39:49,423 --> 01:39:51,341
<i>I am Jack's broken heart.</i>

1359
01:39:55,743 --> 01:39:59,147
<i>What comes next in Project Mayhem
only Tyler knows.</i>

1360
01:39:59,943 --> 01:40:02,820
<i>The second rule is
you do not ask questions.</i>

1361
01:40:05,822 --> 01:40:08,623
Get the fuck away from me!
Get the fuck away!

1362
01:40:09,428 --> 01:40:11,346
Who are all these people?

1363
01:40:15,863 --> 01:40:18,021
The Paper Street Soap Company.

1364
01:40:20,467 --> 01:40:21,905
Can I come in?

1365
01:40:25,060 --> 01:40:26,509
He's not here.

1366
01:40:27,266 --> 01:40:28,302
What?

1367
01:40:29,865 --> 01:40:32,503
Tyler isn't here.

1368
01:40:33,701 --> 01:40:35,620
Tyler went away.

1369
01:40:35,706 --> 01:40:37,106
Tyler's gone.

1370
01:40:52,863 --> 01:40:54,580
Jesus! Get some help!

1371
01:41:06,990 --> 01:41:10,461
Two gunshot wounds coming through!
Make some fucking room!

1372
01:41:10,864 --> 01:41:12,821
What happened? What happened?

1373
01:41:12,907 --> 01:41:14,144
We were on assignment.

1374
01:41:14,221 --> 01:41:17,184
We were supposed to kill
two birds with one stone.

1375
01:41:17,347 --> 01:41:19,745
Destroy a piece of corporate art...

1376
01:41:19,822 --> 01:41:22,181
Operation Latte Thunder. Go!

1377
01:41:23,629 --> 01:41:26,027
And trash a franchise coffee bar.

1378
01:41:31,781 --> 01:41:34,188
We had it all worked out, sir.

1379
01:41:41,745 --> 01:41:44,949
- It went smooth until...
- Police! Freeze!

1380
01:41:45,025 --> 01:41:47,701
- What?
- They shot Bob.

1381
01:41:49,226 --> 01:41:51,940
- They shot him in the head.
- Fucking pigs!

1382
01:41:56,668 --> 01:41:58,260
Oh, God!

1383
01:41:58,346 --> 01:42:02,020
- Those motherfuckers!
- You morons.

1384
01:42:02,509 --> 01:42:05,347
You run around in ski masks
trying to blow things up?

1385
01:42:05,424 --> 01:42:07,860
What did you think was gonna happen?

1386
01:42:10,987 --> 01:42:14,468
OK, quick! We gotta
get rid of the evidence, his body!

1387
01:42:14,545 --> 01:42:16,501
- Bury him.
- What?

1388
01:42:16,702 --> 01:42:19,148
Take him to the garden and bury him.

1389
01:42:19,867 --> 01:42:23,905
- Come on, people, let's go!
- Get the fuck off! Get away from him!

1390
01:42:23,982 --> 01:42:25,305
What are you talking about?

1391
01:42:25,382 --> 01:42:28,105
This isn't fucking evidence.
This is a person.

1392
01:42:28,268 --> 01:42:31,184
He's my friend
and you're not burying him in the garden!

1393
01:42:31,261 --> 01:42:33,860
He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir.

1394
01:42:33,946 --> 01:42:36,660
- This is Bob.
- But, sir, in...

1395
01:42:36,746 --> 01:42:38,904
In Project Mayhem, we have no names.

1396
01:42:38,981 --> 01:42:40,266
Now, you listen to me.

1397
01:42:40,343 --> 01:42:44,668
This is a man and he has a name,
and it's Robert Paulsen, OK?

1398
01:42:44,745 --> 01:42:45,781
Robert Paulsen?

1399
01:42:45,867 --> 01:42:48,101
He's a man,
and he's dead now because of us.

1400
01:42:48,188 --> 01:42:49,943
Do you understand that?

1401
01:42:50,988 --> 01:42:52,427
I understand.

1402
01:42:54,585 --> 01:42:58,785
In death, a member of Project Mayhem
has a name.

1403
01:43:00,550 --> 01:43:02,545
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1404
01:43:03,302 --> 01:43:05,345
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1405
01:43:05,949 --> 01:43:08,702
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1406
01:43:09,622 --> 01:43:12,106
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1407
01:43:12,269 --> 01:43:15,348
- Come on, guys. Please. Stop it.
- His name is Robert Paulsen.

1408
01:43:18,781 --> 01:43:21,188
Shut up! This is all over with!

1409
01:43:54,505 --> 01:43:55,503
Tyler?

1410
01:43:55,589 --> 01:43:57,987
No, this is Detective Stern
of the Arson Unit.

1411
01:43:58,188 --> 01:43:59,627
I need to see you...

1412
01:44:04,029 --> 01:44:07,980
<i>I went to all the cities
on Tyler's used ticket stubs, bar-hopping.</i>

1413
01:44:08,661 --> 01:44:09,946
<i>I didn't know how,</i>

1414
01:44:10,023 --> 01:44:12,986
<i>but I could look at 50 different bars,
and somehow I just knew.</i>

1415
01:44:13,063 --> 01:44:17,427
I'm looking for Tyler Durden.
It's very important that I talk to him.

1416
01:44:17,503 --> 01:44:20,582
I wish I could help you, sir.

1417
01:44:26,662 --> 01:44:28,427
<i>Every city I went to,</i>

1418
01:44:29,549 --> 01:44:31,908
<i>as soon as I set foot off the plane,</i>

1419
01:44:31,985 --> 01:44:34,143
<i>I knew a Fight Club was close.</i>

1420
01:44:34,862 --> 01:44:35,869
Hey! Hey!

1421
01:44:37,068 --> 01:44:38,180
Taxi!

1422
01:44:38,343 --> 01:44:39,743
Look at my face. I'm a member.

1423
01:44:39,830 --> 01:44:42,908
Now, I just need to know
if you've seen Tyler.

1424
01:44:42,985 --> 01:44:46,466
I'm not exposed to bespeak
any such information to you,

1425
01:44:46,543 --> 01:44:50,705
nor would I, even if I had said information
at this juncture, be able.

1426
01:44:52,748 --> 01:44:55,146
- You're a moron.
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

1427
01:44:56,747 --> 01:45:01,629
<i>Tyler had been busy,
setting up franchises all over the country.</i>

1428
01:45:04,304 --> 01:45:07,460
<i>Was I asleep? Had I slept?</i>

1429
01:45:08,543 --> 01:45:11,142
<i>Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?</i>

1430
01:45:12,101 --> 01:45:14,384
- We've just heard the stories.
- What stories?

1431
01:45:14,461 --> 01:45:18,863
- Nobody knows what he looks like.
- He has plastic surgery every three years.

1432
01:45:19,381 --> 01:45:21,423
That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.

1433
01:45:21,510 --> 01:45:25,701
- Is it true about Fight Club in Miami?
- Is Mr. Durden building an army?

1434
01:45:26,506 --> 01:45:29,508
<i>I was living in a state
of perpetual déjà vu.</i>

1435
01:45:30,342 --> 01:45:33,383
<i>Everywhere I went,
I felt I'd already been there.</i>

1436
01:45:34,102 --> 01:45:36,701
<i>It was like following an invisible man.</i>

1437
01:45:37,861 --> 01:45:39,904
<i>The smell of dried blood.</i>

1438
01:45:40,901 --> 01:45:43,740
<i>Dirty, bare footprints circling each other.</i>

1439
01:45:43,827 --> 01:45:46,627
<i>That aroma of old sweat,
like fried chicken.</i>

1440
01:45:47,308 --> 01:45:51,422
<i>The feel of a floor still warm
from a fight the night before.</i>

1441
01:45:51,508 --> 01:45:54,146
<i>I was always just one step behind Tyler.</i>

1442
01:45:56,985 --> 01:46:02,020
His name is Robert Paulsen.
His name is Robert Paulsen. His...

1443
01:46:04,743 --> 01:46:06,345
Welcome back, sir.

1444
01:46:07,745 --> 01:46:09,347
How have you been?

1445
01:46:10,421 --> 01:46:11,907
Do you know me?

1446
01:46:12,425 --> 01:46:15,302
- Is this a test, sir?
- No. This is not a test.

1447
01:46:16,904 --> 01:46:19,100
You were in here last Thursday.

1448
01:46:19,628 --> 01:46:20,826
Thursday?

1449
01:46:21,344 --> 01:46:25,343
You were standing where you are now,
asking how good security is.

1450
01:46:25,861 --> 01:46:27,827
It's tight as a drum, sir.

1451
01:46:29,860 --> 01:46:31,663
Who do you think I am?

1452
01:46:32,421 --> 01:46:35,941
- Are you sure this isn't a test?
- No, this is not a test.

1453
01:46:37,466 --> 01:46:39,029
You're Mr. Durden.

1454
01:46:39,950 --> 01:46:42,184
You're the one who gave me this.

1455
01:46:43,230 --> 01:46:46,788
<i>Please return your seat backs
to their full upright and locked position.</i>

1456
01:46:58,104 --> 01:46:59,543
- Yeah?
- Marla, it's me.

1457
01:46:59,629 --> 01:47:01,662
- Have we ever done it?
- Done what?

1458
01:47:01,749 --> 01:47:04,702
- Had sex.
- What kind of stupid question is that?

1459
01:47:04,789 --> 01:47:07,829
Stupid because the answer's yes
or because it's no?

1460
01:47:07,906 --> 01:47:09,824
- Is this a trick?
- No. I need to know...

1461
01:47:09,900 --> 01:47:14,226
You wanna know if I think
we were just having sex or making love?

1462
01:47:14,302 --> 01:47:16,825
- We did make love?
- Is that what you're calling it?

1463
01:47:17,064 --> 01:47:20,181
Just answer the question!
Did we do it or not?

1464
01:47:20,268 --> 01:47:22,905
You fuck me, then snub me.
You love me, you hate me.

1465
01:47:22,982 --> 01:47:25,466
You're sensitive,
then you turn into an asshole.

1466
01:47:25,542 --> 01:47:28,103
Does that describe our relationship, Tyler?

1467
01:47:28,746 --> 01:47:30,740
<i>We have just lost cabin pressure.</i>

1468
01:47:30,903 --> 01:47:32,620
- What did you say?
- What is wrong with you?

1469
01:47:32,706 --> 01:47:35,066
- Say my name!
- Tyler Durden.

1470
01:47:35,142 --> 01:47:37,626
Tyler Durden, you fucking freak!
What's going on?

1471
01:47:37,703 --> 01:47:39,659
- I'm coming over!
- I'm not there!

1472
01:47:41,664 --> 01:47:43,620
You broke your promise.

1473
01:47:43,707 --> 01:47:45,903
- Jesus, Tyler.
- You talked to her about me.

1474
01:47:45,989 --> 01:47:50,947
- What the fuck is going on?
- I ask you for one thing. One simple thing.

1475
01:47:51,024 --> 01:47:53,345
Why do people think that I'm you?

1476
01:47:53,901 --> 01:47:55,186
Answer me!

1477
01:47:59,147 --> 01:48:00,183
Sit.

1478
01:48:03,348 --> 01:48:06,225
Answer me. Why do people think I'm you?

1479
01:48:06,503 --> 01:48:08,181
I think you know.

1480
01:48:08,268 --> 01:48:10,262
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

1481
01:48:10,349 --> 01:48:13,264
Why would anyone
possibly confuse you with me?

1482
01:48:14,626 --> 01:48:16,228
I don't know.

1483
01:48:20,582 --> 01:48:22,346
- You got it.
- No.

1484
01:48:22,586 --> 01:48:25,224
- Do not fuck with us!
- Say it.

1485
01:48:26,700 --> 01:48:27,986
Because...

1486
01:48:29,702 --> 01:48:30,863
Say it!

1487
01:48:32,781 --> 01:48:34,987
Because we're the same person.

1488
01:48:35,226 --> 01:48:36,262
That's right.

1489
01:48:36,348 --> 01:48:38,823
We are the all-singing, all-dancing...

1490
01:48:38,909 --> 01:48:42,467
- I don't understand this.
- You wanted a way to change your life.

1491
01:48:42,544 --> 01:48:44,663
You could not do this on your own.

1492
01:48:44,750 --> 01:48:47,866
All the ways you wish you could be,
that's me.

1493
01:48:48,989 --> 01:48:51,185
I look like you wanna look,
fuck like you wanna fuck,

1494
01:48:51,261 --> 01:48:56,220
I am smart, capable and, most importantly,
I'm free in all the ways that you are not.

1495
01:48:56,507 --> 01:48:57,505
Oh, no.

1496
01:48:57,582 --> 01:49:00,622
- Tyler's not here. Tyler went away.
- What?

1497
01:49:00,708 --> 01:49:04,784
- This isn't possible. This is crazy.
- People do it every day.

1498
01:49:05,024 --> 01:49:08,668
They talk to themselves.
They see themselves as they'd like to be.

1499
01:49:08,745 --> 01:49:12,629
They don't have the courage you have
to just run with it.

1500
01:49:14,863 --> 01:49:18,345
You still wrestle with it,
so sometimes you're still you.

1501
01:49:18,422 --> 01:49:19,908
We should do this again sometime.

1502
01:49:20,263 --> 01:49:22,421
Other times,
you imagine you're watching me.

1503
01:49:22,507 --> 01:49:25,259
If this is your first
time, you have to fight.

1504
01:49:25,346 --> 01:49:28,865
Little by little,
you're just letting yourself become...

1505
01:49:30,745 --> 01:49:31,867
Tyler Durden.

1506
01:49:31,944 --> 01:49:35,349
You are not your job
or how much money you have!

1507
01:49:35,742 --> 01:49:37,382
- No. You have a house.
- Rented in your name.

1508
01:49:37,468 --> 01:49:40,901
- You have jobs, a life.
- You work nights because you can't sleep.

1509
01:49:41,064 --> 01:49:44,747
- Or you stay up and make soap.
- You're fucking Marla, Tyler.

1510
01:49:44,824 --> 01:49:47,260
Technically, you are.
But it's all the same to her.

1511
01:49:49,821 --> 01:49:51,307
Oh, my God.

1512
01:49:52,103 --> 01:49:54,107
Now you see our dilemma.

1513
01:49:54,664 --> 01:49:56,467
She knows too much.

1514
01:49:57,349 --> 01:50:00,428
I think we're gonna have to talk about
how this might compromise our goals.

1515
01:50:02,509 --> 01:50:04,628
What are you saying?

1516
01:50:04,743 --> 01:50:08,589
This is bullshit. This is bullshit!
I'm not listening to this.

1517
01:50:08,666 --> 01:50:11,543
- You are insane!
- No. You're insane.

1518
01:50:11,629 --> 01:50:14,660
And we simply
do not have time for this crap.

1519
01:50:16,309 --> 01:50:18,141
<i>It's called a changeover.</i>

1520
01:50:18,227 --> 01:50:22,102
<i>The movie goes on,
and nobody in the audience has any idea.</i>

1521
01:50:35,308 --> 01:50:38,780
- Sir! Are you checking out?
- Yeah. Bill me.

1522
01:50:38,866 --> 01:50:42,184
I need you to initial
this list of phone calls, please.

1523
01:50:45,541 --> 01:50:49,108
- When were these made?
- Between 2:00 and 3:30 this morning.

1524
01:50:54,345 --> 01:50:56,589
<i>Have I been going to bed earlier
every night?</i>

1525
01:50:56,666 --> 01:50:58,747
<i>Have I been sleeping later?</i>

1526
01:51:00,262 --> 01:51:03,062
<i>Have I been Tyler longer and longer?</i>

1527
01:51:06,668 --> 01:51:08,184
Is anybody here?

1528
01:51:10,505 --> 01:51:12,902
<i>Déjà vu, all over again.</i>

1529
01:51:14,024 --> 01:51:16,940
With enough soap,
one could blow up anything.

1530
01:51:19,587 --> 01:51:20,987
Oh, my God.

1531
01:51:24,583 --> 01:51:26,501
- 1888.
- Who am I calling?

1532
01:51:26,904 --> 01:51:29,062
Franklin. This is maintenance.

1533
01:51:30,549 --> 01:51:33,023
Hello? Hello?

1534
01:51:33,109 --> 01:51:34,663
Franklin Street?

1535
01:51:35,785 --> 01:51:37,665
Yes. Can I help you?

1536
01:51:40,149 --> 01:51:42,623
- Hello?
- Yeah, yeah.

1537
01:51:43,141 --> 01:51:45,222
I need to talk to your supervisor
right away.

1538
01:51:45,308 --> 01:51:47,188
- Speaking.
- OK, listen to me.

1539
01:51:47,265 --> 01:51:50,228
Something terrible
is about to happen to your building.

1540
01:51:50,305 --> 01:51:52,185
It's under control, sir.

1541
01:51:52,865 --> 01:51:56,184
- Excuse me?
- Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid.

1542
01:52:00,030 --> 01:52:01,065
2160.

1543
01:52:09,150 --> 01:52:11,624
Marla! Marla! Hey, wait!

1544
01:52:13,427 --> 01:52:15,902
Wait! I gotta talk to you! Marla! Marla!

1545
01:52:15,988 --> 01:52:18,424
Your bald freaks hit me
with a fucking broom!

1546
01:52:18,501 --> 01:52:20,141
They almost broke my arm!

1547
01:52:20,227 --> 01:52:21,704
They were burning
their fingertips with lye.

1548
01:52:23,708 --> 01:52:26,384
It'll take a tremendous act of faith
on your part, but hear me out.

1549
01:52:26,461 --> 01:52:30,028
- Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
- A little more faith than that.

1550
01:52:34,229 --> 01:52:35,984
I don't wanna hear
anything you have to say.

1551
01:52:36,061 --> 01:52:38,708
You have every right to be...

1552
01:52:38,784 --> 01:52:40,300
I'll just have a coffee, thanks.

1553
01:52:40,386 --> 01:52:42,784
Sir, anything you order
is free of charge, sir.

1554
01:52:43,944 --> 01:52:46,505
- Why is it free of charge?
- Don't ask.

1555
01:52:46,706 --> 01:52:47,905
Whatever.

1556
01:52:47,982 --> 01:52:49,382
I'll have the clam chowder,

1557
01:52:49,468 --> 01:52:52,662
fried chicken with a baked potato
and chocolate chiffon pie.

1558
01:52:52,748 --> 01:52:54,743
Clean food, please.

1559
01:52:54,829 --> 01:52:57,303
In that case, sir,
I advise against the clam chowder.

1560
01:52:57,390 --> 01:52:59,423
No clam chowder. Thank you.

1561
01:53:01,945 --> 01:53:03,863
You got about 30 seconds.

1562
01:53:05,427 --> 01:53:08,505
I know I've been acting very strange, OK?

1563
01:53:08,822 --> 01:53:11,229
I know it seems there's two sides to me...

1564
01:53:11,305 --> 01:53:13,300
Two sides?
You're Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Jackass.

1565
01:53:13,387 --> 01:53:16,580
I deserved that.
But I realized something important.

1566
01:53:16,666 --> 01:53:17,827
What?

1567
01:53:17,904 --> 01:53:21,021
The full extent of our relationship
wasn't clear to me until now,

1568
01:53:21,107 --> 01:53:23,063
for reasons I won't go into.

1569
01:53:23,150 --> 01:53:25,461
- I know I haven't treated you well.
- Whatever.

1570
01:53:25,547 --> 01:53:29,786
No, no. Fifteen seconds, please!
Fifteen seconds, don't open your mouth.

1571
01:53:30,304 --> 01:53:32,347
I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry.

1572
01:53:32,424 --> 01:53:35,943
What I've come to realize
is that I really like you, Marla.

1573
01:53:38,024 --> 01:53:39,741
- You do?
- I really do.

1574
01:53:40,470 --> 01:53:44,709
I care about you and I don't want anything
bad to happen to you because of me.

1575
01:53:44,786 --> 01:53:47,308
Your life is in danger.

1576
01:53:49,063 --> 01:53:51,787
- What?
- You need to leave town for a while.

1577
01:53:51,902 --> 01:53:54,107
Get out of any major city.
Just go camping...

1578
01:53:54,184 --> 01:53:55,824
You're an insane person.

1579
01:53:55,901 --> 01:53:59,507
- I've involved you in something terrible.
- No. Shut up!

1580
01:53:59,584 --> 01:54:01,588
- You're not safe.
- Shut up!

1581
01:54:03,947 --> 01:54:07,946
- Listen, I tried, Tyler. I really tried.
- I know you did.

1582
01:54:08,109 --> 01:54:13,068
There are things about you I like.
You're smart, funny, spectacular in bed.

1583
01:54:13,701 --> 01:54:16,185
But you're intolerable.

1584
01:54:16,827 --> 01:54:20,500
You have very serious emotional problems

1585
01:54:20,587 --> 01:54:22,428
for which you should seek
professional help.

1586
01:54:22,505 --> 01:54:26,504
- I know, and I'm sorry.
- You're sorry, I'm sorry, everyone's sorry.

1587
01:54:27,827 --> 01:54:29,745
I can't do this anymore.

1588
01:54:30,541 --> 01:54:32,901
I can't. I won't.

1589
01:54:34,704 --> 01:54:35,941
I'm gone.

1590
01:54:36,861 --> 01:54:38,981
You can't leave, Marla! You're not safe!

1591
01:54:42,462 --> 01:54:44,102
- Marla, you don't understand!
- Leave me alone!

1592
01:54:44,189 --> 01:54:46,308
I am trying to protect you!

1593
01:54:46,509 --> 01:54:49,540
- I never want to see you again!
- If that's what it takes...

1594
01:54:49,904 --> 01:54:51,583
Wait right here.

1595
01:54:55,822 --> 01:54:57,701
Hold it right there! Shut up!

1596
01:54:58,306 --> 01:55:01,586
Take this money and get on this bus.
I promise I will never bother you again.

1597
01:55:02,823 --> 01:55:04,060
Shut up!

1598
01:55:04,146 --> 01:55:06,985
Please get on the bus.
Please get on the bus.

1599
01:55:08,462 --> 01:55:11,186
- Why are you doing this?
- They think you're a threat.

1600
01:55:11,262 --> 01:55:13,305
I can't explain now. Trust me.

1601
01:55:13,382 --> 01:55:15,223
If I see where you're going,
you won't be safe.

1602
01:55:15,309 --> 01:55:17,822
I'm not paying this back.
I consider it asshole tax.

1603
01:55:17,908 --> 01:55:21,543
Fine. Remember, stay out of major cities
for a couple of days, OK?

1604
01:55:21,630 --> 01:55:22,828
Tyler...

1605
01:55:24,267 --> 01:55:26,425
You're the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

1606
01:55:40,782 --> 01:55:43,189
Hello. I need you to arrest me.

1607
01:55:43,822 --> 01:55:45,980
I am the leader of a terrorist organization

1608
01:55:46,066 --> 01:55:50,382
responsible for numerous acts of vandalism
and assault all over this city.

1609
01:55:51,024 --> 01:55:54,342
In the metropolitan area,
we had probably 200 members.

1610
01:55:54,745 --> 01:55:58,581
Chapters have sprung up
in five or six other major cities already.

1611
01:55:58,668 --> 01:56:01,746
This is a tightly regimented organization

1612
01:56:01,823 --> 01:56:06,187
with many cells capable of operating
independent of central leadership.

1613
01:56:07,146 --> 01:56:10,828
Go to the house, OK? 1537 Paper Street.

1614
01:56:11,423 --> 01:56:12,986
That's our headquarters.

1615
01:56:13,063 --> 01:56:17,705
In the back, buried in the garden,
you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen.

1616
01:56:18,990 --> 01:56:21,224
In the basement, you'll find some bathtubs

1617
01:56:21,301 --> 01:56:25,703
that have been used very recently
to make large quantities of nitroglycerin.

1618
01:56:26,902 --> 01:56:29,626
I believe the plan is
to blow up the headquarters

1619
01:56:29,702 --> 01:56:31,467
of these credit-card companies

1620
01:56:31,544 --> 01:56:33,260
and the TRW building.

1621
01:56:34,948 --> 01:56:38,180
Why these buildings?
Why credit-card companies?

1622
01:56:38,545 --> 01:56:41,825
If you erase the debt record,
then we all go back to zero.

1623
01:56:42,668 --> 01:56:44,663
You'll create total chaos.

1624
01:56:47,109 --> 01:56:49,986
Keep him talking.
I need to make a phone call.

1625
01:56:59,701 --> 01:57:02,022
I really admire what you're doing.

1626
01:57:03,144 --> 01:57:05,743
- What?
- You're a brave man to order this.

1627
01:57:06,664 --> 01:57:08,380
You're a genius, sir.

1628
01:57:08,467 --> 01:57:12,303
You said if anyone ever interferes
with Project Mayhem, even you,

1629
01:57:13,387 --> 01:57:14,863
we gotta get his balls.

1630
01:57:15,947 --> 01:57:19,265
- Don't fight.
- It's a powerful gesture, Mr. Durden.

1631
01:57:19,342 --> 01:57:22,382
- It'll set quite an example.
- You're making a big mistake!

1632
01:57:22,469 --> 01:57:24,588
- You said you'd say that.
- I'm not Tyler Durden!

1633
01:57:24,665 --> 01:57:26,861
You told us you'd say that too.

1634
01:57:27,389 --> 01:57:29,307
All right. I am Tyler Durden.

1635
01:57:29,383 --> 01:57:33,824
Listen to me. I'm giving you a direct
order. We're aborting this mission now.

1636
01:57:33,900 --> 01:57:36,509
You said you would definitely say that.

1637
01:57:38,226 --> 01:57:39,703
Let me go!

1638
01:57:40,901 --> 01:57:44,421
Are you fucking out of your minds?
You're police officers!

1639
01:57:46,147 --> 01:57:47,548
Is somebody timing this?

1640
01:57:47,624 --> 01:57:49,341
Keep your mouth shut.

1641
01:57:50,588 --> 01:57:51,624
Shit!

1642
01:57:55,143 --> 01:57:58,020
Some of this information checks out.

1643
01:57:58,385 --> 01:58:01,147
- Let's go to that house on Paper Street.
- Be right there.

1644
01:58:02,422 --> 01:58:03,468
Hey, wait!

1645
01:58:03,621 --> 01:58:04,820
- You got him?
- I got him.

1646
01:58:04,906 --> 01:58:06,460
Sir, we have to do this.

1647
01:58:06,546 --> 01:58:09,184
- Stop fighting!
- Where's the rubber band?

1648
01:58:09,270 --> 01:58:12,147
Get away from me!
Drop that fucking knife!

1649
01:58:15,062 --> 01:58:18,467
Back up. Face down on the floor right now!

1650
01:58:20,510 --> 01:58:22,303
Get down on the floor!

1651
01:58:26,667 --> 01:58:30,580
First person that comes out this door
gets a lead salad! Understand?

1652
01:58:54,422 --> 01:58:56,263
Get away! Stay away!

1653
01:59:08,865 --> 01:59:09,987
<i>I ran.</i>

1654
01:59:11,425 --> 01:59:15,146
<i>I ran until my muscles burned
and my veins pumped battery acid.</i>

1655
01:59:17,784 --> 01:59:19,740
<i>Then I ran some more.</i>

1656
01:59:59,588 --> 02:00:02,465
What the fuck are you doing,
running around in your underpants?

1657
02:00:02,542 --> 02:00:04,268
You look crazy!

1658
02:00:04,345 --> 02:00:07,222
No. I'm onto you.
I know what's going on here.

1659
02:00:07,309 --> 02:00:11,902
Come on then. I got us a great place
to watch from. It'll be like pay-per-view.

1660
02:00:58,589 --> 02:00:59,826
Oh, Christ.

1661
02:00:59,902 --> 02:01:01,667
Now what are you doing?

1662
02:01:01,744 --> 02:01:03,748
- I'm stopping this.
- Why?

1663
02:01:04,266 --> 02:01:07,901
- The greatest thing you've ever done.
- I can't let this happen.

1664
02:01:07,987 --> 02:01:10,020
There are 10 other bombs
in 10 other buildings.

1665
02:01:10,586 --> 02:01:12,629
Since when is Project Mayhem
about murder?

1666
02:01:12,706 --> 02:01:17,741
The buildings are empty. We're not
killing anyone. We're setting them free!

1667
02:01:17,827 --> 02:01:20,503
Bob is dead. They shot him in the head.

1668
02:01:21,107 --> 02:01:23,102
You wanna make an omelet,
you gotta break eggs.

1669
02:01:23,188 --> 02:01:26,343
No. I'm not listening to you.
You're not even there.

1670
02:01:33,421 --> 02:01:37,180
Wouldn't do that.
Not unless I knew which wires were what.

1671
02:01:37,267 --> 02:01:39,146
If you know, then I know.

1672
02:01:44,268 --> 02:01:48,900
Or maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent
all day thinking about the wrong ones.

1673
02:01:56,946 --> 02:01:58,222
You think?

1674
02:01:59,507 --> 02:02:01,943
Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one.

1675
02:02:02,029 --> 02:02:04,388
Pull any one but the green one.

1676
02:02:09,270 --> 02:02:11,620
I asked you not to do that!

1677
02:02:13,864 --> 02:02:14,986
Fuck!

1678
02:02:16,223 --> 02:02:18,342
Tyler, get away from the van.

1679
02:02:20,260 --> 02:02:23,147
Tyler, I'm not kidding!
Get away from the van!

1680
02:02:24,030 --> 02:02:25,343
Goddamn it!

1681
02:02:31,750 --> 02:02:32,949
OK.

1682
02:02:33,025 --> 02:02:36,027
You are now firing a gun
at your imaginary friend

1683
02:02:36,104 --> 02:02:38,664
near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!

1684
02:02:40,909 --> 02:02:42,903
Cool it, Tyler!

1685
02:02:55,342 --> 02:02:57,941
Aw, come on! Don't go!

1686
02:03:35,468 --> 02:03:36,504
What?

1687
02:04:20,265 --> 02:04:23,660
Three minutes. This is it.

1688
02:04:23,986 --> 02:04:26,020
The beginning.

1689
02:04:26,106 --> 02:04:27,506
Ground zero.

1690
02:04:27,583 --> 02:04:32,023
<i>- I think this is about where we came in.</i>
- Want to say a few words for the occasion?

1691
02:04:34,584 --> 02:04:35,667
I'm sorry?

1692
02:04:35,744 --> 02:04:38,027
I still can't think of anything.

1693
02:04:39,302 --> 02:04:41,144
Flashback humor.

1694
02:04:46,744 --> 02:04:48,864
It's getting exciting now.

1695
02:04:50,187 --> 02:04:53,544
Two and a half.
Think of everything we've accomplished.

1696
02:04:55,385 --> 02:04:59,308
Out these windows, we will view
the collapse of financial history.

1697
02:04:59,461 --> 02:05:02,300
One step closer to economic equilibrium.

1698
02:05:16,503 --> 02:05:19,102
- Why is she here?
- Tying up loose ends.

1699
02:05:19,822 --> 02:05:22,507
Put me down, you bald-headed fuck!

1700
02:05:23,188 --> 02:05:27,389
- I beg you, please don't do this.
- I'm not doing this. We are doing this.

1701
02:05:27,465 --> 02:05:30,342
- This is what we want.
- No. I don't want this.

1702
02:05:30,505 --> 02:05:35,061
Right. Except you is meaningless now.
We have to forget about you.

1703
02:05:35,943 --> 02:05:38,744
- You're a voice in my head.
- You're a voice in mine!

1704
02:05:38,830 --> 02:05:42,263
- Why can't I get rid of you?
- You need me.

1705
02:05:42,350 --> 02:05:44,584
No. I don't. I really don't anymore.

1706
02:05:44,661 --> 02:05:48,583
You created me. I didn't create some
loser alter ego to make me feel better.

1707
02:05:48,785 --> 02:05:51,067
- Take some responsibility.
- I do.

1708
02:05:51,144 --> 02:05:54,501
I am responsible for all of it,
and I accept that.

1709
02:05:54,587 --> 02:05:58,020
So, please, I'm begging you,
please call this off.

1710
02:06:00,428 --> 02:06:02,307
Have I ever let us down?

1711
02:06:03,909 --> 02:06:06,508
How far have you come because of me?

1712
02:06:11,744 --> 02:06:13,749
I will bring us through this.

1713
02:06:13,825 --> 02:06:17,508
As always, I will carry you
kicking and screaming,

1714
02:06:17,623 --> 02:06:19,982
and in the end you will thank me.

1715
02:06:20,222 --> 02:06:22,620
Tyler. Tyler.

1716
02:06:22,744 --> 02:06:26,465
I'm grateful to you
for everything that you've done for me.

1717
02:06:26,542 --> 02:06:28,863
But this is too much. I don't want this.

1718
02:06:28,949 --> 02:06:33,543
What do you want? Your shit job back?
Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms?

1719
02:06:33,630 --> 02:06:35,586
Fuck you! I won't do it.

1720
02:06:36,545 --> 02:06:40,228
- This can't be happening.
- It's already done, so shut up!

1721
02:06:40,784 --> 02:06:44,141
- 60 seconds till CRI.
- No.

1722
02:06:45,781 --> 02:06:48,667
I can figure this out.
This isn't even real.

1723
02:06:48,984 --> 02:06:52,666
You're not real. That gun...
That gun isn't even in your hand.

1724
02:06:53,789 --> 02:06:55,505
The gun's in my hand.

1725
02:07:01,384 --> 02:07:04,060
Good for you. It doesn't change a thing.

1726
02:07:11,943 --> 02:07:14,629
Why do you wanna put a gun to your head?

1727
02:07:15,261 --> 02:07:17,103
Not my head, Tyler.

1728
02:07:17,381 --> 02:07:18,743
Our head.

1729
02:07:20,786 --> 02:07:22,147
Interesting.

1730
02:07:25,466 --> 02:07:28,266
Where are you going with this, IKEA boy?

1731
02:07:34,068 --> 02:07:36,706
Hey. It's you and me.

1732
02:07:40,503 --> 02:07:41,789
Friends?

1733
02:07:43,141 --> 02:07:44,426
Tyler,

1734
02:07:47,667 --> 02:07:50,142
I want you to really listen to me.

1735
02:07:50,784 --> 02:07:51,782
OK.

1736
02:07:53,709 --> 02:07:55,464
My eyes are open.

1737
02:08:12,305 --> 02:08:13,945
What's that smell?

1738
02:08:33,826 --> 02:08:37,020
- Where is everybody?
- Oh, no. What's going on?

1739
02:08:37,509 --> 02:08:38,947
Mr. Durden!

1740
02:08:39,302 --> 02:08:40,741
Oh, my God!

1741
02:08:41,709 --> 02:08:42,707
Sir!

1742
02:08:46,025 --> 02:08:49,065
Are you... Are you all right, sir?

1743
02:08:49,468 --> 02:08:53,026
- Oh, yeah, I'm OK.
- You look terrible, sir. What happened?

1744
02:08:53,343 --> 02:08:56,862
- Oh, nothing, it's no problem.
- No, no, no, sir. He's not kidding.

1745
02:08:56,949 --> 02:09:00,420
- You look awful. You need assistance.
- I'm fine.

1746
02:09:00,909 --> 02:09:03,269
Look, I'm fine. Everything's fine.

1747
02:09:05,263 --> 02:09:08,026
Ow! Stop it!

1748
02:09:08,102 --> 02:09:10,461
- Let her go.
- Christ Almighty!

1749
02:09:11,305 --> 02:09:12,466
You!

1750
02:09:13,224 --> 02:09:14,509
Hi, Marla.

1751
02:09:15,947 --> 02:09:19,745
- Leave her with me. Meet me downstairs.
- Are you sure?

1752
02:09:19,946 --> 02:09:21,548
Yes, I'm sure.

1753
02:09:23,303 --> 02:09:27,302
You fucker! What sick fucking game
are you playing at, putting me on a...

1754
02:09:27,389 --> 02:09:29,661
Oh, my God, your face!

1755
02:09:29,748 --> 02:09:31,186
Yeah, I know.

1756
02:09:36,423 --> 02:09:38,542
- What happened?
- Don't ask.

1757
02:09:38,629 --> 02:09:40,508
- You're shot.
- Yes, I'm shot.

1758
02:09:40,585 --> 02:09:42,340
Oh, my God.

1759
02:09:42,465 --> 02:09:45,668
- I can't believe he's standing.
- Tough motherfucker.

1760
02:09:49,667 --> 02:09:51,144
Who did this?

1761
02:09:51,662 --> 02:09:53,225
I did actually.

1762
02:09:53,906 --> 02:09:55,546
Find some gauze.

1763
02:09:57,109 --> 02:10:01,224
- You shot yourself?
- Yes, but it's OK. Marla, look at me.

1764
02:10:01,310 --> 02:10:02,748
I'm really OK.

1765
02:10:04,187 --> 02:10:07,064
Trust me. Everything's gonna be fine.

1766
02:10:19,867 --> 02:10:22,342
You met me at
a very strange time in my life.

1767
02:10:24,826 --> 02:10:27,942
<i>With your feet on the air
and your head on the ground.</i>

1768
02:10:31,903 --> 02:10:34,387
<i>Try this trick and spin it.</i>

1769
02:10:35,068 --> 02:10:36,785
<i>Yeah!</i>

1770
02:10:37,226 --> 02:10:40,266
<i>Your head will collapse
but there's nothing in it.</i>

1771
02:10:40,343 --> 02:10:42,424
<i>And you'll ask yourself.</i>

1772
02:10:42,501 --> 02:10:45,186
<i>Where is my mind?</i>

1773
02:10:45,263 --> 02:10:47,421
<i>Where is my mind?</i>

1774
02:10:47,545 --> 02:10:50,624
<i>Where is my mind?</i>

1775
02:10:58,382 --> 02:11:02,861
<i>Way out in the water.</i>

1776
02:11:02,947 --> 02:11:04,463
<i>See it swimming?</i>

1777
02:11:10,188 --> 02:11:13,228
<i>I was swimming in the Caribbean.</i>

1778
02:11:16,508 --> 02:11:19,903
<i>Animals were hiding behind a rock.</i>

1779
02:11:21,908 --> 02:11:23,500
<i>Except the little fish.</i>

1780
02:11:23,586 --> 02:11:25,101
<i>When they told me east is west.</i>

1781
02:11:25,188 --> 02:11:27,345
<i>Trying to talk to me, coy koi.</i>

1782
02:11:27,460 --> 02:11:30,107
<i>Where is my mind?</i>

1783
02:11:30,184 --> 02:11:32,582
<i>Where is my mind?</i>

1784
02:11:32,668 --> 02:11:35,142
<i>Where is my mind?</i>

1785
02:11:43,381 --> 02:11:47,226
<i>Way out in the water.</i>

1786
02:11:47,303 --> 02:11:48,905
<i>See it swimming?</i>

1787
02:12:02,581 --> 02:12:06,187
<i>With your feet on the air
and your head on the ground.</i>

1788
02:12:09,543 --> 02:12:11,624
<i>Try this trick and spin it.</i>

1789
02:12:12,142 --> 02:12:13,264
<i>Yeah!</i>

1790
02:12:14,828 --> 02:12:16,304
<i>Your head will collapse</i>

1791
02:12:16,381 --> 02:12:18,021
<i>if there's nothing in it.</i>

1792
02:12:18,107 --> 02:12:20,064
<i>And you'll ask yourself.</i>

1793
02:12:20,141 --> 02:12:22,826
<i>Where is my mind?</i>

1794
02:12:22,903 --> 02:12:24,984
<i>Where is my mind?</i>

1795
02:12:25,060 --> 02:12:27,986
<i>Where is my mind?</i>

1796
02:12:35,869 --> 02:12:39,945
<i>Way out in the water.</i>

1797
02:12:40,022 --> 02:12:41,786
<i>See it swimming?</i>

1798
02:12:53,064 --> 02:12:56,268
<i>Your feet are on the air
and your head on the ground.</i>

1799
02:12:59,624 --> 02:13:02,703
<i>Try this trick and spin it...</i>
