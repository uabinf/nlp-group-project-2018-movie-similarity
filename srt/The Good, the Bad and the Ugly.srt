1
00:10:58,688 --> 00:11:01,649
You're from Baker?

2
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,027
Tell Baker that I told him
all that I know already.

3
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:05,779
Tell him I want to live
in peace understand?

4
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:08,740
There is no use to
go on tormenting me!

5
00:11:08,782 --> 00:11:11,618
I know nothing at all
about that case of coins.

6
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,203
Now that gold has disappeared,
but if he'd listened

7
00:11:13,244 --> 00:11:15,413
we could have
avoided this altogether.

8
00:11:16,956 --> 00:11:18,750
I went to the army court.

9
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:20,585
There were no witnesses.

10
00:11:20,627 --> 00:11:23,004
They couldn't uncover any more.

11
00:11:23,046 --> 00:11:26,007
I can't tell Baker
what happened to the money.

12
00:11:26,049 --> 00:11:27,634
Go back and tell him that.

13
00:11:30,387 --> 00:11:32,263
Word's around you had a visitor,

14
00:11:34,391 --> 00:11:35,892
and Baker knows it.

15
00:11:38,228 --> 00:11:39,813
Name of Jackson.

16
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,778
Well, Jackson was here

17
00:11:48,988 --> 00:11:50,782
or Baker's got it all wrong.

18
00:11:59,082 --> 00:12:00,417
He's not wrong.

19
00:12:01,418 --> 00:12:02,919
Maybe Baker would like to know,

20
00:12:03,002 --> 00:12:06,047
just what you and
Jackson had to say,

21
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:08,091
about the cash box.

22
00:12:12,178 --> 00:12:14,097
That's not what
I'm being paid for.

23
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:22,272
I'm only interested in what name
Jackson's hiding under now.

24
00:12:25,984 --> 00:12:28,695
Why do you think Jackson may
be assuming another name?

25
00:12:28,695 --> 00:12:30,405
I would have found him already.

26
00:12:31,906 --> 00:12:34,367
When I start off to find
somebody I find him.

27
00:12:35,326 --> 00:12:36,786
That's why they pay me.

28
00:12:42,917 --> 00:12:44,544
What is Baker paying you?

29
00:12:48,131 --> 00:12:49,340
That your family?

30
00:12:59,768 --> 00:13:00,852
Yes.

31
00:13:00,852 --> 00:13:02,812
Nice family.

32
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:08,151
What does he pay
you for murdering me?

33
00:13:11,571 --> 00:13:13,448
$500

34
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,533
to get the name.

35
00:13:22,081 --> 00:13:23,333
The name.

36
00:13:33,134 --> 00:13:35,595
Carson. Bill Carson.

37
00:13:36,596 --> 00:13:38,556
That's what he calls himself now.

38
00:14:09,546 --> 00:14:12,131
That's a lot of money. $1,000.

39
00:14:16,344 --> 00:14:17,846
$1,000?

40
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,977
And some in gold
That's a tidy sum.

41
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:32,694
But when I'm paid,
I always see the job through.

42
00:15:45,808 --> 00:15:46,976
It's you.

43
00:15:47,727 --> 00:15:49,062
Any information?

44
00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:52,690
Too much.

45
00:15:54,525 --> 00:15:57,195
He said quite a bit
that should interest you,

46
00:15:57,236 --> 00:15:59,989
and one or two
things that interested me.

47
00:16:00,073 --> 00:16:01,366
Such as?

48
00:16:02,492 --> 00:16:05,995
The name Jackson's
hiding under is Bill Carson.

49
00:16:09,165 --> 00:16:10,708
That's your bit.

50
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:14,587
Keep talking.

51
00:16:15,546 --> 00:16:19,550
He also mentioned something
about a certain cash box,

52
00:16:19,592 --> 00:16:21,427
which just happened to disappear.

53
00:16:22,428 --> 00:16:24,555
That's my bit.

54
00:16:24,597 --> 00:16:26,182
Anything else?

55
00:16:26,808 --> 00:16:28,267
Not enough for you, eh?

56
00:16:29,352 --> 00:16:31,270
Well, you don't have to worry.

57
00:16:31,312 --> 00:16:33,064
He'll never say
anything to anybody again.

58
00:16:33,648 --> 00:16:35,692
Oh, yeah, yeah. Perfect.

59
00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:38,569
Here you are.

60
00:16:39,362 --> 00:16:41,155
Here. This is for you.

61
00:16:41,155 --> 00:16:43,116
You did a good job for me.

62
00:16:43,157 --> 00:16:45,368
Worth $500.

63
00:16:47,745 --> 00:16:50,873
Yeah. I almost forgot.

64
00:16:50,873 --> 00:16:52,709
He gave me $1,000.

65
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:55,962
I think his idea
was that I kill you.

66
00:17:03,261 --> 00:17:05,763
But you know the pity is
when I'm paid,

67
00:17:05,805 --> 00:17:08,141
I always follow my job through.

68
00:17:08,808 --> 00:17:10,393
You know that.

69
00:17:10,601 --> 00:17:12,270
No! Angel Eyes.

70
00:17:57,482 --> 00:18:01,569
No. No pistol, amigo.
It won't do you any good.

71
00:18:01,611 --> 00:18:03,154
There are three of us.

72
00:18:18,252 --> 00:18:19,337
Hey, amigo.

73
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:24,884
You know you've got a face beautiful
enough to be worth $2,000?

74
00:18:27,095 --> 00:18:28,304
Yeah.

75
00:18:30,139 --> 00:18:32,850
But you don't look like the
one who'll collect it.

76
00:18:40,817 --> 00:18:42,693
A couple steps back.

77
00:19:37,248 --> 00:19:38,666
Thank you.

78
00:19:48,134 --> 00:19:50,386
How much are you worth now?

79
00:19:50,428 --> 00:19:51,596
How much?

80
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,807
$2,000.

81
00:19:57,143 --> 00:19:59,145
That's right, $2,000.

82
00:19:59,145 --> 00:20:01,272
Yeah, $2,000.

83
00:20:10,531 --> 00:20:14,827
You'll pay for this! I hope
you end up in a graveyard

84
00:20:14,869 --> 00:20:17,872
with the cholera and the
rabies and the plague!

85
00:20:17,872 --> 00:20:19,165
Cut me loose!

86
00:20:19,165 --> 00:20:21,209
Cut me loose,
you filthy bastard!

87
00:20:21,209 --> 00:20:23,085
Put me down!

88
00:20:23,085 --> 00:20:25,963
I hope your mother ends up
in a two-dollar whorehouse!

89
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:28,090
Cut me loose! Cut me loose!

90
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,469
You can still save yourself.

91
00:20:31,469 --> 00:20:33,638
Let me go, and I'll pardon you.

92
00:20:34,472 --> 00:20:36,515
Let me go.

93
00:20:36,557 --> 00:20:38,434
I think I feel sick.

94
00:20:38,434 --> 00:20:41,312
The blood is bursting through my...

95
00:20:41,312 --> 00:20:42,980
I'm dry, Blondie.

96
00:20:44,857 --> 00:20:45,983
Water.

97
00:20:51,948 --> 00:20:57,203
You swine. You son of
a bitch Let me go!

98
00:20:57,203 --> 00:20:59,080
You're brave with
a man who's tied up!

99
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,873
Come back!

100
00:21:00,873 --> 00:21:05,169
Come back and fight!
You bastard.

101
00:21:06,587 --> 00:21:08,297
Who the hell is that?

102
00:21:08,297 --> 00:21:10,466
One bastard goes in
another comes out.

103
00:21:10,466 --> 00:21:12,468
Cut it out! Cut it out!

104
00:21:12,468 --> 00:21:15,888
I'm an honest farmer!
I'm innocent of any...

105
00:21:18,391 --> 00:21:22,019
So, you're an honest farmer
You recognize this man?

106
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:23,187
Me'?

107
00:21:23,187 --> 00:21:24,397
Yeah, it's you.

108
00:21:26,274 --> 00:21:29,735
Me? Who says so?
You can't even read.

109
00:21:29,777 --> 00:21:31,946
Yeah, roll it up Roll it up.

110
00:21:31,988 --> 00:21:34,573
I'll give you a good idea
where you can put it.

111
00:21:34,615 --> 00:21:38,327
To hell with all you sheriffs and
deputies and all who gave birth to you.

112
00:21:38,327 --> 00:21:41,664
Hey, everybody, look, look He's
giving him the filthy money.

113
00:21:41,706 --> 00:21:44,959
Judas. You sold my hide.

114
00:21:45,001 --> 00:21:47,253
But you won't enjoy any of
that money, not a penny.

115
00:21:47,295 --> 00:21:48,462
If there's justice in the world

116
00:21:48,546 --> 00:21:49,880
that money will go
to the undertakers.

117
00:21:49,964 --> 00:21:51,340
Every penny of it.

118
00:21:51,382 --> 00:21:53,509
You know who you are?

119
00:21:53,551 --> 00:21:55,845
You want to know
whose son you are?

120
00:21:55,886 --> 00:21:58,222
You don't, I do. Everybody does.

121
00:21:58,264 --> 00:22:02,059
You're the son of a thousand
fathers, all bastards like you.

122
00:22:02,101 --> 00:22:04,103
And your mother Your mother!

123
00:22:04,145 --> 00:22:06,230
She's... You bastard!

124
00:22:07,231 --> 00:22:10,276
Your mother. It's better
not to talk of her!

125
00:22:10,318 --> 00:22:11,652
I never hurt anybody!

126

00:22:55,196 --> 00:22:58,324
we sentence
the accused here before us.

Tuco Benedicto Pacifico
Juan Maria Ramirez...

138
00:23:02,244 --> 00:23:03,371
Known as "The Rat"

139
00:23:03,371 --> 00:23:05,247
and any other
aliases he might have

140
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:09,126
to hang by the neck until dead.

141
00:23:09,168 --> 00:23:10,711
May God have mercy on his soul.

142
00:23:10,753 --> 00:23:11,962
Proceed.

143
00:23:38,739 --> 00:23:42,326
Five for you. One, two

144
00:23:42,326 --> 00:23:45,037
three, four, five for me.

145
00:23:47,081 --> 00:23:50,793
Five for you and five for me.

146
00:23:52,044 --> 00:23:54,255
Know how much you're worth now?

147
00:23:54,296 --> 00:23:56,173
No. How much?

148
00:23:56,215 --> 00:23:57,716
$3,000.

149
00:24:01,637 --> 00:24:04,473
There are two kinds of people
in the world, my friend,

150
00:24:04,515 --> 00:24:05,850
those with a rope
around their neck,

151
00:24:05,891 --> 00:24:08,477
and the people who have the
job of doing the cutting.

152
00:24:08,477 --> 00:24:11,856
Listen, the neck at
the end of the rope is mine

153
00:24:11,897 --> 00:24:13,566
I run the risks.

154
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,987
So the next time,
I want more than half.

155
00:24:17,987 --> 00:24:21,657
You may run the risks my
friend, but I do the cutting.

156
00:24:23,784 --> 00:24:25,995
If we cut down my percentage.

157
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,373
Cigar?

158
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,002
It's liable
to interfere with my aim.

159
00:24:36,088 --> 00:24:39,049
But if you miss you had
better miss very well.

160
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:43,804
Whoever double crosses me
and leaves me alive,

161
00:24:43,846 --> 00:24:46,515
he understands
nothing about Tuco.

162
00:24:48,058 --> 00:24:49,268
Nothing.

176
00:25:27,223 --> 00:25:29,183
If you ask me,
it seems like a book.

177
00:25:29,225 --> 00:25:31,894
An armed unit escorting
a cash box of gold coins,

178
00:25:31,936 --> 00:25:33,437
meets a Yankee ambush,

179
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:35,856
and only three of them are saved.

180
00:25:35,898 --> 00:25:38,526
Stevens, Baker and Jackson.

181
00:25:38,526 --> 00:25:41,028
The thing that wasn't saved
though, was the coins.

182
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,780
But then the army decides
of course,

183
00:25:42,821 --> 00:25:45,157
it ought to hold a hearing
and Jackson's acquitted.

184
00:25:45,199 --> 00:25:47,952
He disappears and
becomes Bill Carson

185
00:25:47,993 --> 00:25:49,203
I know his name.

186
00:25:49,203 --> 00:25:52,289
But you don't know just who
you're looking for, and I do.

187
00:25:52,331 --> 00:25:55,960
And when he's found I'd be
scared to be put in his shoes.

188
00:25:58,921 --> 00:26:00,005
Where is Carson?

189
00:26:00,005 --> 00:26:01,715
All I know is Carson reenlisted.

190
00:26:01,757 --> 00:26:03,342
The poor guy's minus an eye.

191
00:26:03,384 --> 00:26:05,719
He lives with a girl
called Maria who'll tell you.

192
00:26:05,761 --> 00:26:07,721
She's a fresh young
whore in the territory.

193
00:26:08,138 --> 00:26:09,223
Where's she?

194
00:26:09,265 --> 00:26:11,183
Now, what's the
name of that town?

195
00:26:11,267 --> 00:26:12,810
Someplace fairly near,

196
00:26:15,396 --> 00:26:16,814
Santa Ana.

197
00:26:19,984 --> 00:26:22,653
Adios, half-soldier.

198
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,826
Hey, Luke, hand me
down a whiskey.

199
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:30,953
"And the sheriff's
office in Sonora."

200
00:26:30,995 --> 00:26:34,081
"The condemned hired himself out
as a guide to a wagon train."

201
00:26:34,123 --> 00:26:37,501
"After receiving his payment in
advance, he deserted the wagon train"

202
00:26:37,585 --> 00:26:40,212
"on the hunting grounds
of the Sioux lndians."

203
00:26:40,254 --> 00:26:44,008
Glad they got him a man
guilty of all those crimes.

204
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:45,926
People with ropes around their
necks don't always hang.

205
00:26:45,968 --> 00:26:47,636
What do you mean?

206
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,763
"The condemned
is also guilty..."

207
00:26:49,805 --> 00:26:52,850
Even a filthy beggar like that
has got a protecting angel.

208
00:26:58,564 --> 00:26:59,940
"As a Mexican general."

209
00:26:59,982 --> 00:27:01,984
A golden-haired angel
watches over him.

210
00:27:03,694 --> 00:27:04,778
For all these crimes

211
00:27:04,778 --> 00:27:07,698
"the accused has made a full
spontaneous confession."

212
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,327
"Therefore, we condemn him to be
hung by the neck until dead."

213
00:27:11,368 --> 00:27:13,412
May the Lord have
mercy on his soul.

214
00:27:13,454 --> 00:27:14,913
Proceed.

215
00:27:29,803 --> 00:27:31,972
Let's get the hell out of here!

216
00:28:03,754 --> 00:28:06,131
What are you trying to say
anybody can miss a shot?

217
00:28:06,215 --> 00:28:08,217
Nobody misses when
I'm at the end of the rope.

218
00:28:08,258 --> 00:28:10,010
You've never had
a rope around your neck.

219
00:28:10,052 --> 00:28:11,762
Well, I'm going to
tell you something.

220
00:28:11,804 --> 00:28:13,639
When that rope
starts to pull tight

221
00:28:13,681 --> 00:28:15,891
you can feel
the devil bite your ass.

222
00:28:19,103 --> 00:28:23,148
Yeah, you're right.
It's getting tougher.

223
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:26,485
The way I figure

224
00:28:26,485 --> 00:28:28,529
there's really
not too much future

225
00:28:28,529 --> 00:28:30,781
with a sawed-off runt like you.

226
00:28:30,823 --> 00:28:32,116
What do you mean?

227
00:28:32,116 --> 00:28:35,661
'Cause I don't think you'll
ever be worth more than $3,000.

228
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,288
What do you mean?

229
00:28:39,206 --> 00:28:41,625
I mean,
our partnership is untied.

230
00:28:43,127 --> 00:28:46,380
Oh, no. Not you You remain tied.

231
00:28:47,089 --> 00:28:49,299
I'll keep the money,
and you can have the rope.

232
00:28:50,175 --> 00:28:52,678
You filthy,
double-crossing bastard!

233
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,346
Of all the stinking
dirty tricks...

234
00:28:54,388 --> 00:28:56,974
The way back to
town is only 70 miles.

235
00:28:58,684 --> 00:28:59,768
You know,
if you save your breath

236
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,562
I feel a man like
you could manage it.

237
00:29:03,522 --> 00:29:06,734
You filthy bastard! Come here!

238
00:29:07,151 --> 00:29:09,570
Come here! Cut this rope off!
Get off that horse.

239
00:29:09,611 --> 00:29:12,030
Get off that horse
you filthy coward!

240
00:29:12,072 --> 00:29:14,950
If I ever catch you, Blondie, I'll
rip your heart out and eat it!

241
00:29:14,992 --> 00:29:16,660
I'll scalp you!
I'll skin you alive!

242
00:29:16,702 --> 00:29:18,036
I'll hang you up by your thumbs!

243
00:29:18,078 --> 00:29:19,913
You pig! You vulture!

244
00:29:19,913 --> 00:29:23,208
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

245
00:29:25,461 --> 00:29:29,047
Such ingratitude, after all the
times I've saved your life.

246
00:29:34,511 --> 00:29:37,556
Where are you going? Wait a minute.
This is only a trick.

247
00:29:37,598 --> 00:29:38,932
You wouldn't leave me here.

248
00:29:38,974 --> 00:29:41,935
Come back! Wait! Blondie!

249
00:29:41,977 --> 00:29:44,271
Listen, Blondie.

250
00:30:08,378 --> 00:30:10,798
I believe madam is home.

251
00:30:12,007 --> 00:30:16,261
Sweet dreams, and many thanks
from the Seventh Cavalry!

252
00:30:24,937 --> 00:30:26,396
You filthy rats!

253
00:30:43,121 --> 00:30:44,206
Maria.

254
00:30:51,797 --> 00:30:54,007
Is that you, Bill?

255
00:31:05,853 --> 00:31:08,730
Who are you? What do
you want with me?

256
00:31:09,731 --> 00:31:12,109
Go on talking about Bill Carson.

257
00:31:13,652 --> 00:31:15,112
I don't know him.

258
00:31:16,613 --> 00:31:18,824
You were calling
to him in the dark.

259
00:31:23,537 --> 00:31:24,705
Where is he'?

260
00:31:24,705 --> 00:31:26,456
What are you going to do to him?

261
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:30,460
I'll ask the questions.

262
00:31:32,588 --> 00:31:33,881
Where is he'?

263
00:31:41,597 --> 00:31:43,765
Where is he? Where?

264
00:31:43,807 --> 00:31:46,768
Where? Where? Where?

265
00:31:51,481 --> 00:31:52,733
That's enough!

266
00:31:54,735 --> 00:31:56,236
I don't know where he is.

267
00:31:56,236 --> 00:31:58,113
He packed his things
ten days ago

268
00:31:58,155 --> 00:32:01,617
and went away with
his unit. They all left.

269
00:32:01,617 --> 00:32:03,410
Which company? Where'd they go?

270
00:32:06,371 --> 00:32:07,831
Hmm?

271
00:32:07,873 --> 00:32:10,250
Third Cavalry, General Sibley.

272
00:32:11,335 --> 00:32:13,337
They left for Santa Fe.

273
00:32:13,837 --> 00:32:15,964
That's all I know, I swear!

274
00:33:42,551 --> 00:33:44,219
But, but.

275
00:33:48,974 --> 00:33:51,435
I'm very sorry,
but the store's closing.

276
00:33:51,476 --> 00:33:52,853
Mmm-hmm.

277
00:34:29,848 --> 00:34:31,141
Revolvers.

278
00:34:31,183 --> 00:34:32,517
Yeah, revolvers.

279
00:34:37,147 --> 00:34:38,398
Revolvers.

280
00:34:39,191 --> 00:34:42,277
Well, here's where
I keep the best ones.

281
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:49,951
Here. Remington, Colt

282
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:55,874
a Roat, Smith-Wesson Colt, Navy,

283
00:34:56,708 --> 00:35:00,087
Joslyn, another Remington.

284
00:35:00,128 --> 00:35:01,797
- And this one.
- That's enough.

285
00:35:45,215 --> 00:35:46,591
Cartridges.

286
00:35:55,475 --> 00:35:57,477
You want to try the pistol?
Just step out back.

287
00:35:57,519 --> 00:35:58,895
Let's go.

288
00:36:04,568 --> 00:36:06,319
Move. Move.

289
00:37:21,728 --> 00:37:23,188
Cartridge.

290
00:37:31,655 --> 00:37:32,781
How much?

291
00:37:44,709 --> 00:37:46,253
How much?

292
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,380
$100.

293
00:37:51,466 --> 00:37:54,427
$200. It's all I've got.

294
00:37:55,553 --> 00:37:56,721
Here.

295
00:38:16,283 --> 00:38:17,409
Come here.

296
00:38:30,505 --> 00:38:31,673
Eh?

297
00:38:31,715 --> 00:38:33,008
Mmm-hmm.

298
00:38:37,012 --> 00:38:41,850
If you work for a living, why
do you kill yourself working?

299
00:39:18,595 --> 00:39:24,934
If you work for a living, why
do you kill yourself working?

300
00:39:52,379 --> 00:39:53,838
Potatoes.

301
00:39:55,256 --> 00:39:58,218
You've got to be
poor to eat potatoes.

302
00:39:59,344 --> 00:40:00,970
Really poor

303
00:40:01,721 --> 00:40:05,183
I'm rich. But I'm lonely.

304
00:40:07,435 --> 00:40:10,188
The world is divided
into two parts,

305
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:15,610
those who have friends, and those
who are lonely like poor Tuco.

306
00:40:18,029 --> 00:40:22,784
You see, I used
to have a friend, Pedro.

307
00:40:23,827 --> 00:40:27,455
Chico and Ramon, his two
brothers, were my friends, too.

308
00:40:30,834 --> 00:40:33,336
But who knows
where they are now?

309
00:40:34,963 --> 00:40:38,758
It's too bad, friends Tough
luck I haven't found you.

310
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,969
I had a good deal for you.

311
00:40:43,388 --> 00:40:47,016
There's a big son of a
bitch who's got $4,000.

312
00:40:48,393 --> 00:40:50,353
$4,000.

313
00:40:51,938 --> 00:40:53,398
And I know where to find it.

314
00:40:56,067 --> 00:40:58,653
If they would help me catch him.

315
00:40:58,695 --> 00:41:01,281
I'd divide it four ways
like a brother.

316
00:41:02,115 --> 00:41:04,909
$1,000 each.

317
00:41:05,452 --> 00:41:06,703
Hmm.

318
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,846
You're alive, Tuco Is it true?

319
00:41:28,349 --> 00:41:30,977
I'm alive and rich.

320
00:41:31,019 --> 00:41:33,771
But people are saying
you got killed in Albuquerque.

321
00:41:34,272 --> 00:41:36,065
And people talk bullshit

322
00:41:39,986 --> 00:41:43,323
I'm alive, you bastards.
I'm alive.

323
00:41:43,364 --> 00:41:46,534
And I've come to
give you $3,000.

324
00:42:05,386 --> 00:42:07,263
This morning,
I heard the whole thing.

325
00:42:07,305 --> 00:42:09,474
They say Colonel Canby's closing
in with his Northerners,

326
00:42:09,516 --> 00:42:12,435
and no later than tomorrow
that they'll be in the city.

327
00:42:12,477 --> 00:42:14,562
That's why these Southerners
are getting out.

328
00:42:15,563 --> 00:42:19,776
You see, as soon as these cowards
hear a Blue Shirt's around, they run.

329
00:42:19,817 --> 00:42:21,361
These Rebels have
no will to fight.

330
00:42:21,402 --> 00:42:22,779
Poor things.

331
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,489
They'll soon be finished.

332
00:42:24,489 --> 00:42:28,159
We get rid of these bastards, then we
begin making money on those Yankees.

333
00:42:28,201 --> 00:42:30,245
They carry gold,
not paper dollars.

334
00:42:30,245 --> 00:42:32,288
And they're going
to beat the South.

335
00:42:33,623 --> 00:42:36,876
Look. See that one with the white
beard sitting in the wagon?

336
00:42:36,876 --> 00:42:38,753
General Sibley He looks dead.

337
00:42:39,003 --> 00:42:40,713
He's finally
getting out of our hair.

338
00:42:40,755 --> 00:42:45,677
Hurray for Dixie!
Hurray! Hurray for Dixie!

339
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:51,891
Where's the owner of that horse?

340
00:42:52,684 --> 00:42:54,269
Please, mister, sir,
a bad heart condition.

341
00:42:54,269 --> 00:42:56,020
Where?

342
00:42:56,062 --> 00:42:58,731
The war has
frightened me already

343
00:42:58,773 --> 00:43:01,234
I'm looking for the
owner of that horse.

344
00:43:01,234 --> 00:43:03,361
He's tall, blond,
he smokes a cigar

345
00:43:03,403 --> 00:43:06,197
and he's a pig. Where is he now?

346
00:43:06,197 --> 00:43:09,158
You leave him be. He doesn't
know who rides every horse.

347
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,411
You stay quiet, old hen.

348
00:43:13,204 --> 00:43:16,624
Upstairs. Upstairs
in room four, senor.

349
00:43:22,338 --> 00:43:23,881
Hear that?

350
00:43:29,137 --> 00:43:31,681
You rotten criminals
How dare you?

351
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:48,169
Your spurs.

352
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:06,270
There are two kinds
of spurs, my friend,

353
00:47:06,312 --> 00:47:08,523
those that come in by the door,

354
00:47:09,315 --> 00:47:11,943
those that come in by the window.

355
00:47:11,943 --> 00:47:13,736
Take off that pistol belt.

356
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:22,912
It's empty-

357
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:26,833
Mine isn't.

358
00:47:33,923 --> 00:47:37,426
Even when Judas hanged himself,
there was a storm, too.

359
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:43,432
That could be cannon fire

360
00:47:43,766 --> 00:47:46,853
Cannon fire or storm,
it's all the same to you.

361
00:47:49,647 --> 00:47:51,482
You ever see this
before, my friend?

362
00:48:01,617 --> 00:48:03,369
Throw it over the roof beam.

363
00:48:06,038 --> 00:48:07,248
That's it.

364
00:48:19,093 --> 00:48:20,595
Now get on that.

365
00:48:30,938 --> 00:48:32,023
That's right.

366
00:48:32,773 --> 00:48:34,191
Now make sure the rope is tight.

367
00:48:35,401 --> 00:48:37,987
It's got to hold
the weight of a pig.

368
00:48:44,744 --> 00:48:46,329
Now put the rope
around your neck.

369
00:48:54,045 --> 00:48:56,047
That's very good.

370
00:48:56,964 --> 00:48:59,133
It's too big for your neck, huh?

371
00:48:59,175 --> 00:49:02,386
We fix that right away.
I have another system

372
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:05,181
a little different than yours.

373
00:49:06,057 --> 00:49:07,934
I don't shoot the rope

374
00:49:07,975 --> 00:49:09,852
I shoot the legs off the stool.

375
00:52:26,507 --> 00:52:28,050
Welcome, my friend.

376
00:52:28,092 --> 00:52:31,804
If you're looking for a summer
vacation spot you've found it.

377
00:52:31,846 --> 00:52:34,723
Our hotel is luxurious
and filled with conveniences.

378
00:52:37,309 --> 00:52:39,478
And the attractions
don't stop there.

379
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:43,732
International cuisine,
healthful and nutritious food.

380
00:52:43,774 --> 00:52:45,818
Corn <i>cobs,</i> Dixie-style.

381
00:52:45,818 --> 00:52:48,654
Our government has
spared no expense.

382
00:52:48,696 --> 00:52:51,448
As you can see,
we are treated very well.

383
00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:52,950
Have you ever heard of anyone

384
00:52:52,992 --> 00:52:54,952
by the name of Bill Carson?

385
00:52:54,994 --> 00:53:00,416
And you? Have you ever heard
of someone named Canby? No?

386
00:53:00,457 --> 00:53:02,334
Well, you see,
he's a Yankee colonel

387
00:53:02,334 --> 00:53:04,628
who decided to tear us to pieces.

388
00:53:04,753 --> 00:53:07,798
The only thing we care about
is saving our own hides.

389
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,301
And you ask me if I know someone.

390
00:53:11,218 --> 00:53:14,054
I just don't know what you
drifters could be thinking.

391
00:53:26,066 --> 00:53:29,486
Carson has a patch over one eye.
He's with the Third.

392
00:53:31,864 --> 00:53:36,076
If he's with the Third
they've already left.

393
00:53:36,076 --> 00:53:37,786
For Glorieta.

394
00:53:37,786 --> 00:53:39,872
Canby's front line is
right on their heels.

395
00:53:39,914 --> 00:53:42,041
Those poor young devils.

396
00:53:42,041 --> 00:53:44,210
And the desert
lies ahead of them.

397
00:53:44,293 --> 00:53:46,921
I really doubt that
any of them are still alive.

398
00:53:48,589 --> 00:53:50,382
And what if they
were still alive?

399
00:53:53,135 --> 00:53:54,386
Worse.

400
00:53:55,262 --> 00:53:58,474
Well, then, you must not have
heard anything about Batterville.

401
00:53:59,016 --> 00:54:01,352
It's one of those
Yankee prison camps

402
00:54:01,393 --> 00:54:03,687
you'd better hope
you never end up in.

403
00:54:04,897 --> 00:54:06,774
Keep it. It's yours.

404
00:56:32,336 --> 00:56:36,340
"We have found the accused Thomas
Larson, alias Shorty Larson,"

405
00:56:36,382 --> 00:56:39,051
"guilty of the following crimes"

406
00:56:39,093 --> 00:56:43,138
"horse theft, theft of supplies
belonging to the Union Army"

407
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:46,100
"theft of supplies belonging
to the Confederate Army,"

408
00:56:46,141 --> 00:56:48,060
wounding two vigilantes

409
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:51,105
"assault and battery on
one named Barry O'Keefe"

410
00:56:51,105 --> 00:56:54,316
perjury, blackmail, robbery

411
00:56:54,316 --> 00:56:56,068
escaping from a state prison

412
00:56:56,068 --> 00:56:58,195
"disturbing the peace,
pandering, highway robbery."

413
00:56:58,237 --> 00:56:59,696
And Shorty?

414
00:57:00,489 --> 00:57:02,032
Forgery and murder.

415
00:57:02,074 --> 00:57:04,910
Therefore, with the powers vested
in us by the laws of this state...

416
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,246
No?

417
00:57:07,246 --> 00:57:09,998
We have condemned the
aforementioned Thomas Larson,

418
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:13,710
alias Shorty Larson, to hang
by the neck until dead.

419
00:57:13,794 --> 00:57:17,131
May God have mercy
on his soul. Proceed.

420
00:57:23,637 --> 00:57:25,347
Sorry, Shorty.

421
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:28,142
Move. Come on, let's go.

422
00:57:54,001 --> 00:57:57,254
I don't know. As soon as I
hit the desert, I'm thirsty.

423
00:57:57,296 --> 00:58:02,384
Burns, huh? They say people with
fair skin can't take too much.

424
00:58:26,492 --> 00:58:29,161
Like that, you won't
have to carry so much.

425
00:58:31,163 --> 00:58:32,414
Where we going?

426
00:58:33,582 --> 00:58:36,793
Where? Where I'm going, amigo.

427
00:58:38,045 --> 00:58:39,505
Over that way.

428
00:58:39,546 --> 00:58:43,967
Another 100 miles
of beautiful, sunbaked sand.

429
00:58:43,967 --> 00:58:46,428
Even the armies are afraid
to march through there.

430
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:48,805
Sibley's men are
retreating up there.

431
00:58:48,847 --> 00:58:50,974
Canby's men are coming here.

432
00:58:52,142 --> 00:58:54,853
But no one will set
foot in this hell,

433
00:58:56,188 --> 00:58:58,357
except you and me

434
00:59:00,067 --> 00:59:02,986
100 miles, that's a nice walk.

435
00:59:06,073 --> 00:59:08,659
What was it you
told me the last time?

436
00:59:10,661 --> 00:59:14,706
"İf you save your breath I feel a
man like you could manage it."

437
00:59:16,833 --> 00:59:21,004
And if you won't manage it
you'll die, only slowly,

438
00:59:22,464 --> 00:59:24,967
very slowly, old friend.

439
00:59:30,013 --> 00:59:32,808
After you, please Start walking.

440
01:01:29,466 --> 01:01:31,009
Taking a rest?

441
01:01:32,052 --> 01:01:34,638
Come on, Blondie We don't
have very far to go.

442
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,556
Only 70 miles.

443
01:01:37,808 --> 01:01:40,811
Only eight-and-a-half hours
more before sunset.

444
01:01:41,645 --> 01:01:43,271
That's not too bad.

445
01:01:45,023 --> 01:01:46,274
Come on.

446
01:03:38,595 --> 01:03:40,347
Okay, let's eat.

447
01:03:41,264 --> 01:03:43,266
That is, I'll eat.

448
01:03:43,809 --> 01:03:44,976
Hmm?

449
01:03:45,268 --> 01:03:47,854
Meanwhile, you can
enjoy a sunbath.

450
01:03:57,656 --> 01:03:59,074
You want some water?

451
01:04:03,829 --> 01:04:05,413
Drink. Drink.

452
01:04:11,461 --> 01:04:12,838
Come on. Come on.

453
01:04:54,588 --> 01:04:57,424
Well, Blondie. So long.

454
01:06:05,116 --> 01:06:06,868
And so, Blondie

455
01:06:09,371 --> 01:06:10,872
it's goodbye.

456
01:07:07,721 --> 01:07:10,974
Whoa, whoa, whoa
whoa. Whoa, boy.

457
01:07:14,853 --> 01:07:17,022
Easy, easy. Easy, easy.

458
01:07:17,063 --> 01:07:19,274
Attaboy. That's nice.

459
01:09:48,214 --> 01:09:51,467
Water. Water.

460
01:09:57,724 --> 01:09:59,517
$200,000 in gold.

461
01:09:59,559 --> 01:10:01,394
It's yours. Just get me water.

462
01:10:06,608 --> 01:10:08,193
What's that you say?

463
01:10:08,985 --> 01:10:10,361
Who the hell are you?

464
01:10:10,361 --> 01:10:11,779
Carson.

465
01:10:12,822 --> 01:10:15,491
My name is Bill Carson
now It's Carson.

466
01:10:16,075 --> 01:10:17,660
Surprise attack.

467
01:10:19,204 --> 01:10:23,291
All dead. My name is
Jackson, not Carson

468
01:10:23,291 --> 01:10:25,668
Carson, Carson, yeah, yeah
Glad to meet you, Carson.

469
01:10:25,752 --> 01:10:29,547
I'm Lincoln's grandfather What was
that you said about the dollars?

470
01:10:29,589 --> 01:10:31,466
$200,000, all mine.

471
01:10:32,926 --> 01:10:34,761
Was the Third Cavalry's

472
01:10:36,012 --> 01:10:38,097
Baker has nothing.

473
01:10:38,765 --> 01:10:42,602
The gold, I hid the gold
The gold is safe.

474
01:10:43,686 --> 01:10:47,273
Where? Where, here? Here? Talk.

475
01:10:47,273 --> 01:10:49,984
In the cemetery.

476
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:52,654
Which cemetery?

477
01:10:52,654 --> 01:10:55,365
The one on Sad Hill.

478
01:10:56,574 --> 01:10:58,826
There's a grave by.

479
01:10:59,202 --> 01:11:03,373
Which grave? Have a name?
Have a number?

480
01:11:03,373 --> 01:11:05,875
Come on, you dummy, talk.

481
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:11,381
There's no number
There's a name.

482
01:11:12,715 --> 01:11:14,592
It's written.

483
01:11:14,634 --> 01:11:15,885
Yes?

484
01:11:21,683 --> 01:11:23,184
Water.

485
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,564
You talk first, huh?
I'll give you water later.

486
01:11:28,564 --> 01:11:30,233
Sad Hill Cemetery. Okay.

487
01:11:30,275 --> 01:11:31,567
In the grave. Okay.

488
01:11:31,609 --> 01:11:34,112
But it must have a name
or a number on it, huh?

489
01:11:34,153 --> 01:11:36,698
There must be a
thousand, five thousand.

490
01:11:41,286 --> 01:11:43,204
Don't die, huh?

491
01:11:43,204 --> 01:11:45,164
Don't die. I'll get you water.

492
01:11:45,665 --> 01:11:49,085
Stay there. Don't move
I'll get you water.

493
01:11:49,168 --> 01:11:51,838
Don't die until later
you son of a...

494
01:12:17,155 --> 01:12:18,865
Get away from there.

495
01:12:24,954 --> 01:12:26,372
He's dead.

496
01:12:26,372 --> 01:12:27,498
Yeah

497
01:12:30,084 --> 01:12:31,878
I'll kill you.

498
01:12:34,672 --> 01:12:37,759
If you do that,
you'll always be poor,

499
01:12:38,885 --> 01:12:41,554
just like the greasy
rat that you are.

500
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:45,808
If I were you, I'd keep me alive.

501
01:12:46,809 --> 01:12:50,146
What did he tell you, huh?

502
01:12:50,146 --> 01:12:51,397
A name.

503
01:12:52,648 --> 01:12:54,108
A name on a grave.

504
01:12:54,776 --> 01:12:56,277
What name?

505
01:13:10,124 --> 01:13:12,335
Blondie, don't die.

506
01:13:12,335 --> 01:13:15,838
Blondie, don't die
I'm your friend.

507
01:13:15,838 --> 01:13:17,215
Please don't die. Please

508
01:13:17,215 --> 01:13:19,425
I'm your friend.
Come on. Come on.

509
01:13:21,469 --> 01:13:23,054
Blondie.

510
01:13:23,054 --> 01:13:24,972
I'll help you I'll help you.

511
01:13:24,972 --> 01:13:26,808
Don't move. I'll be right back.

512
01:13:26,849 --> 01:13:30,103
Here's the water.
Don't die like that pig.

513
01:13:30,144 --> 01:13:34,190
Hey, Blondie, here's water.
Water, Blondie.

514
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:36,109
Don't drink, don't drink
ls no good for you.

515
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:38,027
Feel better?

516
01:13:38,027 --> 01:13:40,071
Blondie, what's the matter?

517
01:13:40,071 --> 01:13:41,823
Please, don't die.

518
01:13:50,665 --> 01:13:53,584
Hey. open up! Open up! Hurry!

519
01:13:54,252 --> 01:13:56,671
Settle down. Settle down.
Who's there?

520
01:13:58,506 --> 01:14:01,843
What do you mean, "Who's there?"
You think I'm the enemy?

521
01:14:05,221 --> 01:14:09,267
If I were a Yankee, you wouldn't
have time to ask me that.

522
01:14:09,267 --> 01:14:10,351
Come on.

523
01:14:10,435 --> 01:14:13,396
Sergeant, listen to
this corporal for a moment.

524
01:14:13,521 --> 01:14:14,605
Yes, sir.

525
01:14:14,605 --> 01:14:17,191
Sergeant, I have a
gravely wounded man here,

526
01:14:17,233 --> 01:14:19,068
if he's not dead already.

527
01:14:21,195 --> 01:14:22,447
He's still alive?

528
01:14:22,447 --> 01:14:24,115
Well, he seems to be.

529
01:14:25,825 --> 01:14:27,493
What happened? It was a trap.

530
01:14:27,535 --> 01:14:29,245
Only the two of us got away.

531
01:14:29,287 --> 01:14:31,080
Name and traveling papers.

532
01:14:33,583 --> 01:14:37,628
Here. Corporal Bill Carson Third
Regiment, 2nd Cavalry Squadron,

533
01:14:37,670 --> 01:14:40,381
arriving from San Rafael
Is that enough?

534
01:14:46,095 --> 01:14:48,347
Are you reading
when this man is dying?

535
01:14:48,848 --> 01:14:50,641
Why, Corporal,
we're trying to withdraw,

536
01:14:50,641 --> 01:14:52,685
and you're looking
for an infirmary?

537
01:14:52,727 --> 01:14:55,813
İf you want one, you'll have to
make yourself a Yankee prisoner.

538
01:14:57,273 --> 01:14:58,816
So where are we?

539
01:14:58,816 --> 01:15:00,443
Near Apache Canyon.

540
01:15:02,153 --> 01:15:03,404
Apache Canyon?

541
01:15:03,404 --> 01:15:04,614
Apache Canyon.

542
01:15:04,614 --> 01:15:07,074
Is a Mission San Antonio
around here?

543
01:15:07,116 --> 01:15:09,494
Sure, 18 miles south
Take him there.

544
01:15:09,535 --> 01:15:11,370
The brothers take care
of anyone who's wounded

545
01:15:11,412 --> 01:15:13,372
no matter what
the color of his uniform.

546
01:15:13,414 --> 01:15:16,125
And keep your eyes open,
the area is full of Yankees.

547
01:15:16,167 --> 01:15:17,960
Thank you. Goodbye, Sergeant.

548
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:19,337
Take care.

549
01:15:44,028 --> 01:15:45,321
I've got a very sick man here.

550
01:15:45,363 --> 01:15:46,948
But we have no more beds here.

551
01:15:46,989 --> 01:15:48,407
Let him have yours.

552
01:15:54,622 --> 01:15:55,790
Where's Pablo Ramirez?

553
01:15:55,790 --> 01:15:56,916
Father Ramirez.

554
01:15:56,958 --> 01:16:01,379
He's away at the moment.
He should be back any day now.

555
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:02,797
Well, it doesn't matter.

556
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,800
For the moment, we take very
good care of my friend.

557
01:16:05,841 --> 01:16:07,635
And may God be praised.

558
01:16:07,677 --> 01:16:10,096
In case you didn't know it
God is on our side, too,

559
01:16:10,137 --> 01:16:13,349
because he hates
the Yanks, huh, Blondie?

560
01:16:13,391 --> 01:16:15,851
Blondie? Father,
is he still breathing?

561
01:16:15,893 --> 01:16:18,187
Yes, of course.

562
01:16:18,187 --> 01:16:19,981
You're heavy.

563
01:16:31,409 --> 01:16:32,618
There.

564
01:17:02,481 --> 01:17:04,984
All right, put a fresh
bandage on him.

565
01:17:06,319 --> 01:17:08,154
Put him in my cell.

566
01:17:09,113 --> 01:17:10,239
Easy.

567
01:17:13,618 --> 01:17:15,911
Out, soldier Out you go. Come on.

568
01:17:15,953 --> 01:17:18,956
Look out for him, please.
He's like a brother to me.

569
01:17:24,503 --> 01:17:26,422
Hey, Father, I.

570
01:17:39,143 --> 01:17:41,854
Father, did he speak'?
Did he say anything'?

571
01:18:12,468 --> 01:18:14,804
Father, did he ask for me? Did
he speak about anything, Father'?

572
01:18:14,845 --> 01:18:16,389
Oh, no, he hasn't spoken <i>as</i> yet.

573
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:17,932
But you mustn't worry.

574
01:18:17,973 --> 01:18:19,642
He's both young and strong.

575
01:18:19,642 --> 01:18:21,977
That's what's kept
him going until now.

576
01:18:22,019 --> 01:18:24,480
He should regain his strength
in a very short time.

577
01:18:24,522 --> 01:18:25,564
Thank you, Father Thank you.

578
01:18:25,606 --> 01:18:27,149
You don't know how much
this boy's life means to me.

579
01:18:27,191 --> 01:18:29,360
Thanks be to Jesus
Thanks to all of you.

580
01:19:18,826 --> 01:19:19,910
Blondie.

581
01:19:25,833 --> 01:19:27,626
Hey, Blondie.

582
01:19:47,730 --> 01:19:51,484
The old father tells me you'll
be up and around in a few days.

583
01:19:51,525 --> 01:19:55,362
You're very lucky to have me
so close when it happened.

584
01:19:55,404 --> 01:19:57,323
Think if you'd been on your own.

585
01:19:59,116 --> 01:20:01,786
Look, I mean, when.

586
01:20:01,786 --> 01:20:04,538
When one is ill

587
01:20:04,538 --> 01:20:09,210
it's good to have somebody
close by friends or relations.

588
01:20:10,044 --> 01:20:15,257
Do you have parents
Blondie? A mother?

589
01:20:16,008 --> 01:20:17,593
Not even a mother.

590
01:20:19,011 --> 01:20:20,137
No one?

591
01:20:21,180 --> 01:20:24,058
You're all alone, huh?
Like me, Blondie.

592
01:20:24,642 --> 01:20:26,435
We're all alone in the world.

593
01:20:27,686 --> 01:20:29,855
I have you, you have me.

594
01:20:32,483 --> 01:20:34,235
Only for a little while, I mean.

595
01:20:34,985 --> 01:20:37,071
It had to happen now.

596
01:20:37,738 --> 01:20:40,241
What a dirty,
rotten trick of fate.

597
01:20:40,282 --> 01:20:42,827
We could have all that
money in our hands.

598
01:20:49,875 --> 01:20:52,378
I must tell you
the truth, Blondie.

599
01:20:52,461 --> 01:20:54,922
In my place, you would
do the same thing.

600
01:20:57,174 --> 01:20:59,134
It's all over for you now.

601
01:21:00,052 --> 01:21:02,513
There's nothing
anyone can do anymore.

602
01:21:05,307 --> 01:21:07,685
God help me. It's my fault.

603
01:21:07,685 --> 01:21:09,937
Mine, mine, mine, mine

604
01:21:21,115 --> 01:21:23,492
I'll tell you one thing, Blondie.

605
01:21:23,868 --> 01:21:27,454
If I knew that
my last hour had come, I swear

606
01:21:27,496 --> 01:21:30,791
in my place, in your place
I would do the same thing.

607
01:21:31,709 --> 01:21:35,129
I would tell about the gold.
Yes. Yes, I would

608
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:37,673
I'd tell the name on the grave.

609
01:21:37,715 --> 01:21:40,342
After all, what good is the
money to you if you're dead'?

610
01:21:40,426 --> 01:21:42,344
I know the name of the cemetery,

611
01:21:42,344 --> 01:21:44,972
but you know how many
graves there are there?

612
01:21:45,723 --> 01:21:49,101
Please, Blondie.

613
01:21:49,101 --> 01:21:55,357
Please, have a little, huh?
Here. Coffee.

614
01:21:55,357 --> 01:21:57,276
Please, tell me the name

615
01:21:58,068 --> 01:22:00,613
on the grave.

616
01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:04,992
If I get my hands
on the $200,000

617
01:22:06,535 --> 01:22:08,662
I'll always honor your memory.

618
01:22:09,580 --> 01:22:12,833
I swear, I'll always
honor your memory.

619
01:22:15,878 --> 01:22:17,546
Come closer.

620
01:22:22,843 --> 01:22:24,511
Tell me.

621
01:22:25,846 --> 01:22:27,556
Why, you dirty...

622
01:22:29,475 --> 01:22:32,102
I'll sleep better,

623
01:22:33,103 --> 01:22:37,191
knowing my good
friend is by my side,

624
01:22:38,108 --> 01:22:40,194
to protect me.

625
01:22:48,786 --> 01:22:50,955
"Tuco, water."
Well, here's water.

626
01:22:50,955 --> 01:22:54,249
But if I get that name from
you I'll give you water.

627
01:23:01,757 --> 01:23:04,635
All right, you dirty skunk
get your ass off the bed.

628
01:23:04,635 --> 01:23:06,762
Come on, come on
the party's over.

629
01:23:06,804 --> 01:23:08,847
The wagon is all ready to go.

630
01:23:08,847 --> 01:23:10,766
From the way the wounded
are pouring into this place,

631
01:23:10,808 --> 01:23:11,934
we better get
the hell out of here

632
01:23:11,976 --> 01:23:14,103
before we get
caught up in the war.

633
01:23:14,144 --> 01:23:15,312
Tuco, Father Ramirez is back.

634
01:23:15,354 --> 01:23:16,563
Yeah.

635
01:23:17,314 --> 01:23:18,607
This is something
I have to look into.

636
01:23:18,649 --> 01:23:20,526
It'll only take
a minute. Get moving.

637
01:23:21,986 --> 01:23:23,445
Where, this way? Yes.

638
01:23:41,088 --> 01:23:42,339
Hey, Pablo.

639
01:23:50,889 --> 01:23:52,850
Don't you recognize me?

640
01:23:54,518 --> 01:23:58,063
It's me, Tuco.
Let me embrace you.

641
01:24:02,109 --> 01:24:04,611
I don't know the right thing.

642
01:24:09,408 --> 01:24:11,744
I was just passing by here
I said to myself,

643
01:24:11,785 --> 01:24:13,954
"I wonder if my brother
remembers his brother."

644
01:24:18,042 --> 01:24:19,126
Did I do wrong?

645
01:24:21,295 --> 01:24:23,505
It doesn't matter
I'm very happy.

646
01:24:23,797 --> 01:24:25,466
You have seen me, Tuco.

647
01:24:28,052 --> 01:24:30,721
Yeah, well, I'm very glad I came.

648
01:24:36,393 --> 01:24:40,773
Oh, my uniform It's a long story.

649
01:24:40,773 --> 01:24:44,234
But let's talk about you
It's more important.

650
01:24:44,276 --> 01:24:46,653
You look very well.

651
01:24:46,653 --> 01:24:48,655
A bit thin, perhaps, but

652
01:24:50,574 --> 01:24:53,035
you were always thin
eh, Pablito?

653
01:24:56,497 --> 01:24:57,998
What about our parents?

654
01:24:59,958 --> 01:25:02,461
Only now do you think of them.

655
01:25:03,295 --> 01:25:05,798
To begin after nine years.

656
01:25:07,466 --> 01:25:08,967
Nine years?

657
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:14,556
So it's nine years Nine years.

658
01:25:15,724 --> 01:25:18,310
Our mother has been dead
a long time now.

659
01:25:19,937 --> 01:25:22,022
Our father died
only a few days ago.

660
01:25:23,273 --> 01:25:25,192
That's why I was away.

661
01:25:27,111 --> 01:25:30,697
He asked for you to be there
but there was only me.

662
01:25:38,664 --> 01:25:39,873
And you?

663
01:25:40,791 --> 01:25:43,544
Outside of evil, what else
have you managed to do?

664
01:25:45,337 --> 01:25:47,714
It seems to me you once
had a wife someplace.

665
01:25:51,343 --> 01:25:53,345
Not one, lots of them.

666
01:25:53,387 --> 01:25:55,722
One here, one there,
wherever I found them.

667
01:25:57,266 --> 01:25:59,726
Go on, preach me
a sermon, Pablo.

668
01:26:01,812 --> 01:26:03,772
What good would that be?

669
01:26:05,315 --> 01:26:07,776
Just keep on
the way you're going.

670
01:26:07,818 --> 01:26:09,486
Go away.

671
01:26:10,737 --> 01:26:11,905
And the Lord have
mercy on your soul.

672
01:26:11,947 --> 01:26:13,031
Sure, I'll go, I'll go.

673
01:26:13,031 --> 01:26:15,868
While I'm waiting for the
Lord to remember me,

674
01:26:15,909 --> 01:26:19,163
I, Tuco Ramirez,
brother of Brother Ramirez

675
01:26:19,204 --> 01:26:21,582
will tell you something.

676
01:26:21,582 --> 01:26:23,792
You think you're
better than I am.

677
01:26:23,834 --> 01:26:26,503
Where we came from if one
didn't want to die of poverty,

678
01:26:26,545 --> 01:26:29,006
one became a priest or a bandit.

679
01:26:29,006 --> 01:26:31,633
You chose your way I chose mine.

680
01:26:31,633 --> 01:26:33,427
Mine was harder!

681
01:26:33,468 --> 01:26:35,179
You talk about Mother and Father.

682
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:38,849
You remember, when you left to
become a priest, I stayed behind.

683
01:26:38,891 --> 01:26:42,728
I must have been 10, 12, I don't
remember which, but I stayed.

684
01:26:42,769 --> 01:26:45,230
I tried, but it was no good.

685
01:26:45,272 --> 01:26:47,399
Now I will tell you something.

686
01:26:47,399 --> 01:26:51,111
You became a priest because you were
too much of a coward to do what I do.

687
01:27:10,339 --> 01:27:11,632
Tuco.

688
01:27:22,643 --> 01:27:24,686
Please forgive me, brother.

689
01:27:53,715 --> 01:27:55,968
My belly's full.

690
01:27:57,844 --> 01:27:59,680
Nice guy, my brother.

691
01:28:00,430 --> 01:28:02,808
I didn't tell you my brother
was in charge here?

692
01:28:02,849 --> 01:28:04,977
Everything. Like the pope almost.

693
01:28:05,018 --> 01:28:08,605
He's in charge in Rome Yeah,
yeah, my brother he say to me,

694
01:28:08,647 --> 01:28:10,565
"Stay, brother Don't go home."

695
01:28:10,607 --> 01:28:12,442
We never see each other.

696
01:28:12,442 --> 01:28:16,989
"Here there's plenty to eat and drink.
Bring your friend, too."

697
01:28:17,030 --> 01:28:19,324
Whenever we see each other
he never lets me go.

698
01:28:19,366 --> 01:28:22,077
It's always the same story.

699
01:28:22,077 --> 01:28:24,830
My brother, he is crazy about me.

700
01:28:28,458 --> 01:28:32,713
That's so. Even a tramp like
me, no matter what happens.

701
01:28:33,714 --> 01:28:36,550
I know there's a brother somewhere
who will never refuse me

702
01:28:36,591 --> 01:28:38,218
a bowl of soup.

703
01:28:40,304 --> 01:28:41,471
Sure.

704
01:28:43,223 --> 01:28:46,768
Well, after a meal there's
nothing like a good cigar.

705
01:29:37,652 --> 01:29:39,946
Here's the Sierra Magdalena.

706
01:29:40,697 --> 01:29:43,283
Going this way,
we cross the Rio Grande.

707
01:29:44,117 --> 01:29:46,119
That sure is a long way.

708
01:29:47,329 --> 01:29:50,791
Here to the northwest
through all of Texas.

709
01:29:51,666 --> 01:29:53,627
After that... Then what?

710
01:29:55,754 --> 01:29:57,172
When we get there I'll tell you.

711
01:29:57,214 --> 01:29:58,840
You're not worried, are you?

712
01:30:02,594 --> 01:30:05,931
Those men aren't worried about
anything anymore, are they?

713
01:30:08,809 --> 01:30:10,685
But since I'm alive
and I've noticed

714
01:30:10,727 --> 01:30:14,272
we'll be crossing Yankee and
Confederate lines a few times,

715
01:30:15,107 --> 01:30:17,526
I thought you might
tell me where we're going.

716
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:20,195
Towards $200,000.

717
01:30:20,195 --> 01:30:21,947
Is that good enough for you?

718
01:30:41,425 --> 01:30:43,802
Hey, wake up, you.

719
01:30:43,844 --> 01:30:45,178
The troops are coming Come on.

720
01:30:45,220 --> 01:30:46,721
Blue or gray?

721
01:30:53,895 --> 01:30:57,566
They're gray like us. Let's say
"hello" to them and then get going.

722
01:30:57,607 --> 01:31:01,570
Hoorah! Hoorah for
the Confederacy!

723
01:31:01,570 --> 01:31:04,906
Hoorah! Down with General Grant!

724
01:31:04,948 --> 01:31:08,076
Hoorah for General
What's his name?

725
01:31:08,118 --> 01:31:09,870
Lee! Lee!

726
01:31:10,787 --> 01:31:14,040
God is with us because
he hates the Yanks, too!

727
01:31:16,042 --> 01:31:19,588
God's not on our side
'cause he hates idiots also.

728
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:35,687
Hut, two, three, four
Hut, two, three, four.

729
01:31:35,729 --> 01:31:39,691
Hut, two, three, four
Hut, two, three, four.

730
01:31:39,733 --> 01:31:42,402
Prisoners of war, forward.

731
01:31:43,987 --> 01:31:45,697
March!

732
01:32:37,666 --> 01:32:39,167
Halt!

733
01:32:42,337 --> 01:32:44,756
Left face!

734
01:32:47,968 --> 01:32:51,012
Form a single file. Move!

735
01:33:33,305 --> 01:33:34,639
Jonathan Frost!

736
01:33:34,681 --> 01:33:36,016
Present!

737
01:33:42,731 --> 01:33:44,274
Richard McGilley!

738
01:33:44,274 --> 01:33:45,734
Present!

739
01:33:45,734 --> 01:33:47,235
Nathaniel Sullivan!

740
01:33:47,235 --> 01:33:48,695
Present

741
01:33:49,946 --> 01:33:51,489
Robert Clark!

742
01:33:51,656 --> 01:33:52,991
Present

743
01:33:53,700 --> 01:33:54,868
Sam Richmond!

744
01:33:54,868 --> 01:33:55,994
Present.

745
01:33:59,497 --> 01:34:00,707
Bill Carson!

746
01:34:04,461 --> 01:34:06,171
Bill Carson!

747
01:34:07,339 --> 01:34:09,633
I said Bill Carson!

748
01:34:09,674 --> 01:34:12,594
Hey, Blondie,
isn't that Angel Eyes?

749
01:34:13,637 --> 01:34:16,222
All right,
what's he doing, sleeping?

750
01:34:17,474 --> 01:34:18,892
Bill Carson!

751
01:34:19,643 --> 01:34:22,812
Yeah, and you
better be Bill Carson.

752
01:34:22,854 --> 01:34:24,397
Bill Carson!

753
01:34:24,731 --> 01:34:27,067
Yeah, that's me.

754
01:34:35,659 --> 01:34:37,494
Please, Carson

755
01:34:38,912 --> 01:34:40,789
answer "present"

756
01:34:42,374 --> 01:34:44,417
What are you, deaf'?

757
01:34:50,215 --> 01:34:52,425
Now suppose you
say "present," Carson.

758
01:34:54,552 --> 01:34:57,764
I like big fat men like you.

759
01:34:57,806 --> 01:34:59,683
When they fall,
they make more noise

760
01:34:59,683 --> 01:35:01,893
and sometimes they never get up

761
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:05,063
Wallace.

762
01:35:06,815 --> 01:35:08,108
That's enough.

763
01:35:11,236 --> 01:35:12,445
Sergeant!

764
01:35:14,531 --> 01:35:16,658
The captain wants
to see you right away.

765
01:35:20,620 --> 01:35:22,455
Be sure these two
get good treatment.

766
01:35:33,383 --> 01:35:35,176
Hey, Blondie, did you hear that?

767
01:35:35,176 --> 01:35:36,845
Good treatment.

768
01:35:39,556 --> 01:35:40,724
Yeah.

769
01:35:44,185 --> 01:35:45,729
For the last time, Sergeant

770
01:35:46,563 --> 01:35:50,817
I'm telling you, I want the
prisoners treated <i>as</i> prisoners.

771
01:35:51,568 --> 01:35:53,111
No more brutality.

772
01:35:54,404 --> 01:35:55,947
There's hundreds of
prisoners out there

773
01:35:55,947 --> 01:35:58,158
and only a few men to guard them.

774
01:35:58,199 --> 01:36:00,368
Now what am I supposed to do?
I have to have respect.

775
01:36:00,660 --> 01:36:03,913
I think that you'll manage
to gain their respect

776
01:36:03,955 --> 01:36:06,332
by treating them better.

777
01:36:06,875 --> 01:36:09,544
Are our men treated that well
in Andersonville camp?

778
01:36:09,627 --> 01:36:12,464
I don't give a God damn
what they do in Andersonville.

779
01:36:12,505 --> 01:36:15,884
While I'm in charge here the
prisoners are not to be tortured,

780
01:36:15,925 --> 01:36:19,053
or cheated or murdered.

781
01:36:19,846 --> 01:36:21,347
That an accusation?

782
01:36:21,806 --> 01:36:26,644
Sergeant, gangrene is eating
my leg away, not my eyes.

783
01:36:27,604 --> 01:36:30,857
I know the prisoners here are
being robbed systematically.

784
01:36:30,899 --> 01:36:34,235
I know there's scum around who
are bivouacked near the camp

785
01:36:34,277 --> 01:36:36,905
waiting for someone
to deliver this loot.

786
01:36:37,572 --> 01:36:42,285
But as long as I'm commandant I won't
permit any such trickery. Am I clear?

787
01:36:44,788 --> 01:36:46,414
Yes.

788
01:36:46,414 --> 01:36:48,208
Just as long as
you're the commandant.

789
01:36:50,543 --> 01:36:52,045
Yes, Sergeant.

790
01:36:54,839 --> 01:36:58,259
I know this leg means
I won't last very long,

791
01:36:58,343 --> 01:37:02,931
but I pray I can manage to have
enough time to amass evidence

792
01:37:02,972 --> 01:37:05,183
and bring to a court-martial

793
01:37:05,225 --> 01:37:10,605
all those who discredit and
dishonor the uniform of the Union.

794
01:37:15,777 --> 01:37:17,779
I wish you luck.

795
01:37:52,313 --> 01:37:55,483
You and the others better
lay low for a few days.

796
01:37:56,442 --> 01:37:58,152
No, I'll keep this. You go

797
01:37:58,194 --> 01:37:59,946
Wallace will let you know

798
01:38:10,748 --> 01:38:13,251
Wallace, bring me Carson.

799
01:38:13,251 --> 01:38:14,836
Right.

800
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:32,562
Listen, Angel Eyes said for
us to lay low for a few days,

801
01:38:32,604 --> 01:38:36,107
but we'll keep close enough
to keep an eye on things.

802
01:38:36,107 --> 01:38:37,692
Come on, saddle your horses.

803
01:38:38,526 --> 01:38:39,903
Get in.

804
01:38:48,828 --> 01:38:51,956
Come on in, Tuco
Don't be bashful.

805
01:38:53,207 --> 01:38:55,335
There's no formalities here.

806
01:39:06,721 --> 01:39:08,264
It's been a long time.

807
01:39:12,393 --> 01:39:15,521
You're hungry Sit down, eat.

808
01:39:35,249 --> 01:39:37,043
I knew it, I knew it.

809
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:41,547
The minute I saw you
I said to myself,

810
01:39:42,757 --> 01:39:45,218
"Look at that pig Angel Eyes."

811
01:39:46,511 --> 01:39:48,429
<i>"I'll</i> bet he got
himself an easyjob"

812
01:39:52,308 --> 01:39:54,185
"and he never forgets a friend."

813
01:39:55,311 --> 01:39:57,271
I never forget old friends, Tuco.

814
01:39:59,941 --> 01:40:01,234
Right.

815
01:40:01,275 --> 01:40:02,860
It's good to see
old friends again.

816
01:40:04,821 --> 01:40:06,447
Good.

817
01:40:06,489 --> 01:40:08,992
Especially when they've
come from so far away

818
01:40:09,993 --> 01:40:11,911
and have so much to talk about.

819
01:40:13,788 --> 01:40:16,708
And you do have a lot to
talk about haven't you?

820
01:40:19,210 --> 01:40:22,422
You were captured
near Fort Craig.

821
01:40:27,218 --> 01:40:28,928
Well, if you were
with Sibley, that means then

822
01:40:28,970 --> 01:40:31,639
that you were coming
from Santa Fe.

823
01:40:45,153 --> 01:40:47,321
Was it hard crossing the desert?

824
01:40:47,321 --> 01:40:49,157
Mmm-Hmm. Very hard.

825
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:53,202
Especially if you don't
have anything to drink.

826
01:40:55,913 --> 01:40:58,499
Why are you going under the
name of Bill Carson now?

827
01:41:04,756 --> 01:41:07,425
One name is as good as another.

828
01:41:07,467 --> 01:41:09,260
Not wise to use your own name.

829
01:41:10,470 --> 01:41:11,763
Like you.

830
01:41:11,763 --> 01:41:13,765
I'll bet they don't
call you Angel Eyes.

831
01:41:14,932 --> 01:41:16,809
Sergeant Angel Eyes.

832
01:41:25,818 --> 01:41:28,988
Like a little music
with your meal, Tuco?

833
01:41:29,030 --> 01:41:33,201
Music? Yes, it's very good,
very good for the digestion.

834
01:41:49,175 --> 01:41:51,677
Bill Carson's a fake name, huh?

835
01:41:57,225 --> 01:41:58,559
That fake, too'?

836
01:42:00,603 --> 01:42:02,980
Bill Carson's name's
written in it.

837
01:42:04,732 --> 01:42:08,528
Have some.
It's Bill Carson's tobacco.

838
01:43:32,695 --> 01:43:34,572
Was Carson dead or alive
when you found him?

839
01:43:41,871 --> 01:43:43,789
What'd he tell you
about the money?

840
01:43:44,624 --> 01:43:46,876
I don't,

841
01:43:46,918 --> 01:43:49,587
I don't know what
you're talking about.

842
01:44:08,314 --> 01:44:09,982
More feeling.

843
01:44:28,584 --> 01:44:32,213
You can sure consider yourself
much luckier than your pal.

844
01:44:32,255 --> 01:44:35,216
Wallace will punch your friend
as long <i>as</i> the song goes.

845
01:44:35,258 --> 01:44:37,677
So many of us have
had a session in there.

846
01:44:59,448 --> 01:45:01,492
How's your digestion now?

847
01:45:05,538 --> 01:45:07,373
You'd better talk.

848
01:45:07,373 --> 01:45:09,709
I have nothing to tell you.

849
01:45:37,278 --> 01:45:38,946
Play that fiddle, you.

850
01:46:21,989 --> 01:46:26,202
Enough. Enough. I talk. I talk.

851
01:46:35,586 --> 01:46:37,755
What did he say about the money?

852
01:46:41,717 --> 01:46:44,220
It's buried in a grave.

853
01:46:45,513 --> 01:46:47,014
Where?

854
01:46:47,056 --> 01:46:48,474
Sad Hill.

855
01:46:48,516 --> 01:46:51,018
Sad Hill Cemetery.

856
01:46:53,813 --> 01:46:55,314
Which grave'?

857
01:46:56,232 --> 01:46:59,985
I don't know.
I don't know, I tell you.

858
01:47:01,362 --> 01:47:05,574
Blondie. Ask Blondie.

859
01:47:05,574 --> 01:47:08,160
He knows the name on the grave.

860
01:47:30,266 --> 01:47:32,017
Put those clothes on.

861
01:47:36,355 --> 01:47:38,023
Why?

862
01:47:38,065 --> 01:47:39,608
We're going for a ride.

863
01:47:41,110 --> 01:47:42,319
Where?

864
01:47:42,319 --> 01:47:44,071
To find $200,000.

865
01:47:45,614 --> 01:47:48,492
I know the name of
the cemetery now,

866
01:47:48,534 --> 01:47:50,995
and you know
the name of the grave.

867
01:48:11,140 --> 01:48:14,101
You're not gonna give me
the same treatment?

868
01:48:17,897 --> 01:48:19,064
Would you talk?

869
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:22,067
No, probably not.

870
01:48:24,153 --> 01:48:25,738
That's what I thought.

871
01:48:26,697 --> 01:48:28,866
Not that you're any
tougher than Tuco,

872
01:48:28,908 --> 01:48:31,952
but you're smart enough to know
that talking won't save you.

873
01:48:35,956 --> 01:48:39,126
And Tuco, is he.

874
01:48:41,378 --> 01:48:43,422
No. Not yet.

875
01:48:44,715 --> 01:48:46,675
But he's in very good hands.

876
01:48:48,260 --> 01:48:51,472
You've changed partners but
you still got the same deal.

877
01:48:51,514 --> 01:48:54,099
I'm not greedy.
I'm only taking half.

878
01:48:55,392 --> 01:48:57,144
There's two of us.

879
01:48:57,186 --> 01:48:58,896
It should make it
easier than just one.

880
01:49:04,193 --> 01:49:05,528
Yeah.

881
01:49:25,589 --> 01:49:29,218
Hold it. That's it, don't move.

882
01:49:30,010 --> 01:49:33,722
Now don't breathe
Still. That's it.

883
01:49:35,641 --> 01:49:37,601
Got it. Thank you.

884
01:49:53,534 --> 01:49:55,494
Hey, Corporal,
afraid he'll get lost?

885
01:49:55,536 --> 01:49:57,246
Where's the rebel going?

886
01:49:57,288 --> 01:50:00,916
To hell, with a rope around his
neck and a price on his head.

887
01:50:00,958 --> 01:50:02,876
$3,000, friend.

888
01:50:02,876 --> 01:50:04,753
That's a lot of money for a head

889
01:50:06,297 --> 01:50:09,008
I'll bet they didn't even pay
you a penny for your arm.

890
01:50:15,472 --> 01:50:18,934
I told you once, friend
if I ever get you down

891
01:50:18,976 --> 01:50:22,062
you're gonna need a lot of
help to get up again. A lot.

892
01:50:41,790 --> 01:50:44,043
You're a lot luckier
than that one there.

893
01:50:44,084 --> 01:50:46,712
You get some trouble, rope
and you're all finished.

894
01:50:46,754 --> 01:50:49,548
And there isn't any partner
this time to shoot you down.

895
01:52:31,859 --> 01:52:34,403
If your friends
stay out in the damp

896
01:52:34,445 --> 01:52:36,947
they're liable to
catch a cold, aren't they?

897
01:52:36,989 --> 01:52:38,574
Or a bullet.

898
01:52:43,412 --> 01:52:45,622
Hear that, boys?
Come on out here.

899
01:52:58,218 --> 01:52:59,762
Since we're all going
in the same direction,

900
01:52:59,762 --> 01:53:01,513
might as well go together.

901
01:53:02,806 --> 01:53:08,061
One, two, three, four

902
01:53:08,103 --> 01:53:10,355
five, six.

903
01:53:10,981 --> 01:53:13,650
Six. Perfect number.

904
01:53:15,444 --> 01:53:17,279
Isn't three the perfect number?

905
01:53:19,448 --> 01:53:22,242
Yeah. But I got six
more bullets in my gun.

906
01:54:26,390 --> 01:54:29,101
Sure would like to
put your paw on it, huh?

907
01:54:31,186 --> 01:54:33,313
I would like to piss It's rough.

908
01:54:33,355 --> 01:54:35,649
I've been shaken up on this
train nearly ten hours now.

909
01:54:35,983 --> 01:54:38,861
You smell like a pig already,

910
01:54:38,861 --> 01:54:41,280
but let's not try
to make things any worse.

911
01:54:43,699 --> 01:54:45,409
Get going-

912
01:54:54,418 --> 01:54:56,795
I can't while you're watching me.

913
01:55:20,485 --> 01:55:22,613
You made a lot of noise
my friend, huh?

914
01:55:44,176 --> 01:55:47,679
You don't want to break our friendship huh?
Well, I'll break it.

915
01:57:32,367 --> 01:57:34,077
Ha.

916
01:57:35,412 --> 01:57:37,122
Take your places.

917
01:57:48,467 --> 01:57:49,968
Ready!

918
01:57:50,427 --> 01:57:52,637
Aim! Fire!

919
01:58:09,905 --> 01:58:12,157
Slim, take care of the horses

920
02:02:28,621 --> 02:02:31,166
I've been looking for
you for eight months.

921
02:02:32,292 --> 02:02:34,169
Whenever I should've
had a gun in my right hand.

922
02:02:35,378 --> 02:02:36,921
I thought of you.

923
02:02:36,963 --> 02:02:40,925
Now I find you in exactly
the position that suits me.

924
02:02:40,967 --> 02:02:44,721
I had lots of time to learn
how to shoot with my left.

925
02:03:00,695 --> 02:03:02,906
When you have to shoot
shoot. Don't talk.

926
02:03:06,868 --> 02:03:09,537
Every gun makes its own tune.

927
02:03:10,497 --> 02:03:12,540
It's perfect timing Large One.

928
02:03:30,767 --> 02:03:33,103
Clem, follow him.

929
02:04:29,909 --> 02:04:32,996
Just a minute.
I'll be right there.

930
02:04:32,996 --> 02:04:36,249
Just give me a little time to
get dressed and I'll open up.

931
02:04:57,187 --> 02:04:59,481
Put your drawers on
and take your gun off.

932
02:05:11,117 --> 02:05:13,036
Hey, Blondie.

933
02:05:13,036 --> 02:05:15,330
How the hell did you get
out of that pigsty?

934
02:05:17,165 --> 02:05:21,044
My own way. I'm here with
your old friend, Angel Eyes.

935
02:05:22,086 --> 02:05:25,256
You talked, you traitor
You talked.

936
02:05:26,049 --> 02:05:27,634
No, I didn't talk.

937
02:05:28,218 --> 02:05:30,512
If I did, I probably
wouldn't be here now.

938
02:05:32,055 --> 02:05:34,224
You, me.

939
02:05:35,058 --> 02:05:37,435
So only you know
your half of the secret?

940
02:05:38,019 --> 02:05:39,103
Mmm-hmm.

941
02:05:43,066 --> 02:05:44,692
Blondie

942
02:05:44,692 --> 02:05:49,113
I'm very happy you're working
with me, and we're together again.

943
02:05:49,155 --> 02:05:51,449
I get dressed I kill
him and be right back.

944
02:05:51,491 --> 02:05:54,410
Oh, listen, I forgot to mention,

945
02:05:56,996 --> 02:05:59,624
he's not alone.
There's five of them.

946
02:06:02,001 --> 02:06:03,127
Five?

947
02:06:03,169 --> 02:06:04,504
Yeah, five of them.

948
02:06:07,757 --> 02:06:10,260
So that's why you came to Tuco?

949
02:06:13,429 --> 02:06:15,765
It doesn't matter.
I'll kill them all.

950
02:06:27,777 --> 02:06:29,696
They shot him at close range.

951
02:06:49,507 --> 02:06:51,718
Well, look who's here.

952
02:06:51,759 --> 02:06:53,970
The other one will be along.

953
02:06:56,431 --> 02:06:58,141
They'll come looking for us.

954
02:07:00,018 --> 02:07:01,519
Watch out.

955
02:07:02,562 --> 02:07:04,230
There's two of them.

956
02:07:05,565 --> 02:07:07,609
I want that blond alive.

957
02:07:16,451 --> 02:07:19,996
You, back there.
Come on, let's go.

958
02:07:53,988 --> 02:07:55,907
Were you gonna die alone?

959
02:09:47,018 --> 02:09:48,186
Halt!

960
02:10:13,127 --> 02:10:14,462
Hey, Blondie.

961
02:10:14,504 --> 02:10:16,339
Angel Eyes is mine, huh?

962
02:10:16,380 --> 02:10:17,590
All right.

963
02:10:57,255 --> 02:10:59,382
See you soon.

964
02:11:02,051 --> 02:11:03,553
Idiots.

965
02:11:04,679 --> 02:11:05,972
It's for you.

966
02:11:31,038 --> 02:11:34,125
How peaceful and quiet, amigo.

967
02:11:34,125 --> 02:11:36,502
Like a cemetery for instance?

968
02:11:37,962 --> 02:11:40,172
There should be
a bridge across that river.

969
02:11:41,007 --> 02:11:42,508
We'd better wait for nightfall.

970
02:11:42,550 --> 02:11:44,176
Trust in me, Blondie.

971
02:11:47,722 --> 02:11:49,473
I got a good sense
of where I'm going.

972
02:11:49,515 --> 02:11:51,017
Tuco has taken you this far.

973
02:11:51,058 --> 02:11:52,935
I will take you all the way...

974
02:11:53,436 --> 02:11:55,104
Gentlemen.

975
02:11:58,524 --> 02:12:00,401
Tell the captain. Yes, sir.

976
02:12:01,652 --> 02:12:03,613
Come along now Follow me.

977
02:12:50,785 --> 02:12:52,870
We found them near
the perimeter, sir.

978
02:13:07,885 --> 02:13:09,845
Where do you hail from?

979
02:13:10,137 --> 02:13:11,180
Illinois.

980
02:13:14,016 --> 02:13:15,810
And you?

981
02:13:15,851 --> 02:13:17,687
I'm with him.

982
02:13:23,943 --> 02:13:26,362
Any reason for
being around here?

983
02:13:27,196 --> 02:13:29,657
We want to enlist, General.

984
02:13:32,618 --> 02:13:35,037
You better learn
to distinguish rank

985
02:13:35,079 --> 02:13:36,956
I'm a captain.

986
02:13:38,541 --> 02:13:39,709
Get the hell out.

987
02:13:41,794 --> 02:13:44,922
It sure as hell might be you
today, so go write your will.

988
02:13:44,964 --> 02:13:46,382
Yes, sir.

989
02:13:51,387 --> 02:13:53,139
So you want to enlist?

990
02:13:54,473 --> 02:13:56,809
You gotta take
a test to prove it.

991
02:14:06,193 --> 02:14:07,528
Well, show me.

992
02:14:31,677 --> 02:14:33,095
You've got a career.

993
02:14:33,137 --> 02:14:36,015
At the least, I'd say
you'll make colonel.

994
02:14:36,057 --> 02:14:37,767
Reaiiy? Sure.

995
02:14:38,809 --> 02:14:42,688
Like it says in the manual,
"You've got every qualification",

996
02:14:42,730 --> 02:14:45,357
"to become an expert
in the use of weapons."

997
02:14:46,609 --> 02:14:50,821
For this, sir, is
the most potent weapon in war.

998
02:14:53,616 --> 02:14:56,118
The fighting spirit's
in this bottle.

999
02:14:58,120 --> 02:14:59,705
Volunteers.

1000
02:15:01,832 --> 02:15:03,709
You want to enlist?

1001
02:15:05,211 --> 02:15:08,297
Let's go. Come on,
gentlemen. Come on.

1002
02:15:11,300 --> 02:15:14,011
The shooting hasn't begun yet.
We still have time.

1003
02:15:30,236 --> 02:15:32,571
Whoever has the most liquor
to get the soldiers drunk

1004
02:15:32,613 --> 02:15:36,158
and send them to be
slaughtered is the winner.

1005
02:15:37,034 --> 02:15:42,039
We and the ones over on the other side of
the river only have one thing in common.

1006
02:15:43,749 --> 02:15:45,501
All of us reek of alcohol.

1007
02:15:53,968 --> 02:15:55,803
What did you say your name was?

1008
02:15:58,764 --> 02:16:00,099
And you?

1009
02:16:10,067 --> 02:16:11,819
Names don't matter.

1010
02:16:12,570 --> 02:16:13,946
Yes, because soon you can join

1011
02:16:13,988 --> 02:16:16,198
the gallant heroes
of Branson Bridge.

1012
02:16:18,534 --> 02:16:20,452
We have two attacks a day.

1013
02:16:20,452 --> 02:16:22,288
Two attacks a day'?

1014
02:16:22,329 --> 02:16:25,875
Sure, the Rebs have
decided that damn bridge

1015
02:16:25,916 --> 02:16:27,751
is the key to this whole area.

1016
02:16:28,794 --> 02:16:31,714
Stupid, useless bridge.

1017
02:16:31,755 --> 02:16:34,633
Flyspeck on headquarters' maps.

1018
02:16:36,385 --> 02:16:41,140
And headquarters has declared we
must take that ridiculous flyspeck

1019
02:16:42,850 --> 02:16:44,977
even if all of us are killed.

1020
02:16:45,019 --> 02:16:47,146
Otherwise,
the key will get rusty

1021
02:16:47,188 --> 02:16:49,356
and just be a spot on the wall.

1022
02:16:50,816 --> 02:16:52,776
And that's not all.

1023
02:16:52,776 --> 02:16:55,404
Both sides want
the bridge intact.

1024
02:16:55,446 --> 02:16:59,950
Intact is how the South wants
it, and we want it intact, too.

1025
02:17:02,620 --> 02:17:04,747
You'll all turn to dust

1026
02:17:04,747 --> 02:17:09,919
but one thing is sure, boys, Branson
Bridge will stand unbroken.

1027
02:17:11,420 --> 02:17:15,591
Is it bad to speak the
way I do to volunteers?

1028
02:17:16,759 --> 02:17:18,260
I've done a lot worse

1029
02:17:23,224 --> 02:17:26,560
I've done it.
I've blown it up. Boom.

1030
02:17:27,853 --> 02:17:30,814
In here, I've destroyed it all.

1031
02:17:32,024 --> 02:17:33,984
It's a court-martial
offense to imagine

1032
02:17:34,026 --> 02:17:37,446
to dream of blowing it up
A serious crime.

1033
02:17:37,488 --> 02:17:41,659
Even to think of destroying
that bridge is just...

1034
02:17:44,495 --> 02:17:46,622
Why not really
blow it up, Captain?

1035
02:17:48,332 --> 02:17:51,293
Yeah, Captain, it's nothing. Let's
scare the hell out of them.

1036
02:17:55,214 --> 02:17:57,383
I've been dreaming about it

1037
02:18:01,011 --> 02:18:03,013
I've even worked out a plan.

1038
02:18:04,640 --> 02:18:06,100
I sure have.

1039
02:18:07,351 --> 02:18:10,354
The best time is
after the attack

1040
02:18:10,396 --> 02:18:13,357
when there's a truce
to get the wounded.

1041
02:18:14,441 --> 02:18:19,113
If I could do it, I could
save many thousands of men.

1042
02:18:24,743 --> 02:18:26,996
But what I lack is the guts.

1043
02:18:32,918 --> 02:18:36,130
They're beginning their daily
slaughter right on time.

1044
02:18:36,171 --> 02:18:39,758
Captain, all companies
are awaiting your orders.

1045
02:18:39,758 --> 02:18:41,260
Be right there.

1046
02:18:54,773 --> 02:18:56,150
Let's go.

1047
02:18:57,151 --> 02:19:01,030
All right, friends, come along
and enjoy the spectacle.

1048
02:19:32,644 --> 02:19:35,314
Companies, report!

1049
02:19:35,356 --> 02:19:38,317
Company B ready!

1050
02:19:38,359 --> 02:19:40,986
Company E ready!

1051
02:19:41,028 --> 02:19:43,113
Company D ready!

1052
02:19:48,911 --> 02:19:52,164
Companies, forwards!

1053
02:20:13,477 --> 02:20:14,728
Hey, Blondie

1054
02:20:14,728 --> 02:20:17,648
it looks like the captain is really
asking for a bullet in his guts.

1055
02:20:17,689 --> 02:20:18,899
Yeah

1056
02:21:12,286 --> 02:21:15,289
I've never seen so many
men wasted so badly.

1057
02:21:35,976 --> 02:21:39,605
I have a feeling it's really
gonna be a good, long battle.

1058
02:21:43,734 --> 02:21:45,486
Blondie? Huh?

1059
02:21:46,069 --> 02:21:48,363
The money's on the other
side of the river.

1060
02:21:50,115 --> 02:21:51,408
Where?

1061
02:21:53,952 --> 02:21:57,122
Amigo, I said the other side
and that's enough.

1062
02:21:57,956 --> 02:22:01,043
But while the Confederates are
there we can't get across.

1063
02:22:02,711 --> 02:22:06,423
What would happen if somebody
were to blow up that bridge?

1064
02:22:08,091 --> 02:22:09,301
Yeah.

1065
02:22:10,302 --> 02:22:13,055
Then these idiots would go
somewhere else to fight.

1066
02:22:13,889 --> 02:22:15,182
Maybe.

1067
02:22:53,178 --> 02:22:55,764
Doctor, quick
the captain's wounded.

1068
02:22:58,433 --> 02:23:00,310
Hurry, a stretcher.

1069
02:23:02,604 --> 02:23:04,273
Easy. Easy now.

1070
02:23:15,158 --> 02:23:16,910
Get things ready.

1071
02:23:37,764 --> 02:23:39,057
A little of this will help.

1072
02:23:46,607 --> 02:23:48,525
Take a slug of this, Captain.

1073
02:23:49,234 --> 02:23:51,111
Keep your ears open.

1074
02:24:39,910 --> 02:24:42,621
- What are you doing?
- No, leave me alone.

1075
02:26:22,053 --> 02:26:25,891
Blondie, you realize
we might be risking our lives.

1076
02:26:26,725 --> 02:26:28,977
Yeah, and if I get killed

1077
02:26:29,060 --> 02:26:32,481
you'll never get your hands
on all that beautiful money.

1078
02:26:32,522 --> 02:26:34,107
Yeah, Tuco

1079
02:26:35,275 --> 02:26:36,902
it sure would be a pity.

1080
02:27:08,141 --> 02:27:09,309
Doc.

1081
02:27:10,936 --> 02:27:12,312
Doctor.

1082
02:27:13,063 --> 02:27:15,273
Could you help me
live a little more?

1083
02:27:16,274 --> 02:27:18,151
I expect good news.

1084
02:28:08,743 --> 02:28:12,080
Why don't we tell each other
our half of the secret?

1085
02:28:12,122 --> 02:28:13,540
Why don't we?

1086
02:28:15,584 --> 02:28:17,085
You go first.

1087
02:28:19,212 --> 02:28:21,298
No, I think it's better that,

1088
02:28:24,301 --> 02:28:25,719
you start.

1089
02:28:29,806 --> 02:28:31,224
All right.

1090
02:28:33,643 --> 02:28:35,729
The name of the cemetery is.

1091
02:28:53,872 --> 02:28:55,665
Sad Hill. Now it's your turn.

1092
02:29:04,382 --> 02:29:06,134
The name on the grave is.

1093
02:29:10,764 --> 02:29:12,349
Arch Stanton.

1094
02:29:14,392 --> 02:29:17,354
Arch Stanton? Are you sure?

1095
02:29:18,605 --> 02:29:20,482
Yeah, sure, I'm sure.

1096
02:41:09,065 --> 02:41:11,484
It'll be a lot easier with that.

1097
02:41:51,732 --> 02:41:54,652
Two can dig a lot
quicker than one.

1098
02:41:58,614 --> 02:42:00,074
You're not digging.

1099
02:42:12,545 --> 02:42:15,715
If you shoot me, you won't
see a cent of that money

1100
02:42:22,221 --> 02:42:24,014
I'll tell you why.

1101
02:42:25,015 --> 02:42:26,851
'Cause there's nothing in there.

1102
02:42:35,484 --> 02:42:36,986
Why, you son of a.

1103
02:42:36,986 --> 02:42:38,612
You thought I'd trust you?

1104
02:42:42,158 --> 02:42:44,118
$200,000 is a lot of money.

1105
02:42:46,162 --> 02:42:48,038
We're gonna have to earn it.

1106
02:42:51,584 --> 02:42:52,752
How?

1107
02:43:04,221 --> 02:43:06,557
I'll write the name
on the bottom of this stone.

1108
02:43:10,603 --> 02:43:11,979
The gun.

1109
02:49:18,804 --> 02:49:22,432
You pig. You want to get me killed?
When'd you unload it?

1110
02:49:24,685 --> 02:49:26,145
Last night.

1111
02:49:27,229 --> 02:49:31,942
You see, in this world there's
two kinds of people, my friend,

1112
02:49:31,984 --> 02:49:36,071
those with loaded guns
and those who dig.

1113
02:49:36,655 --> 02:49:37,865
You dig.

1114
02:49:38,448 --> 02:49:39,658
Where?

1115
02:49:50,586 --> 02:49:51,795
Here.

1116
02:49:56,091 --> 02:49:57,634
There's no name on it!

1117
02:49:59,219 --> 02:50:01,180
There's no name here either.

1118
02:50:03,015 --> 02:50:05,934
You see, that's what
Bill Carson told me.

1119
02:50:05,934 --> 02:50:10,022
It was the grave marked "Unknown"
right beside Arch Stanton.

1120
02:50:17,654 --> 02:50:19,364
Go ahead.

1121
02:51:17,089 --> 02:51:19,716
Blondie! It's all ours, Blondie.

1122
02:51:36,566 --> 02:51:37,818
You're joking, Blondie.

1123
02:51:37,818 --> 02:51:40,570
You wouldn't play
a joke on me like that.

1124
02:51:41,905 --> 02:51:44,283
It's no joke. It's a rope, Tuco.

1125
02:51:45,117 --> 02:51:46,451
Now I want you to stand up there

1126
02:51:46,493 --> 02:51:48,120
and put your head in that noose.

1127
02:52:55,645 --> 02:52:59,858
Well, now, seems
just like old times.

1128
02:53:04,112 --> 02:53:06,156
Four for you

1129
02:53:07,699 --> 02:53:09,368
and four.

1130
02:53:12,537 --> 02:53:14,039
Four for me.

1131
02:53:52,744 --> 02:53:55,497
Hey, Blondie.

1132
02:53:56,623 --> 02:53:58,125
Sorry, Tuco.

1133
02:54:02,337 --> 02:54:03,422
Blondie.

1134
02:54:12,848 --> 02:54:15,851
Blondie!

1135
02:54:34,703 --> 02:54:35,787
Blondie.

1136
02:55:03,523 --> 02:55:06,443
Blondie!

1137
02:55:32,636 --> 02:55:34,054
Blondie!

1138
02:56:34,489 --> 02:56:36,533
Hey, Blondie!

1139
02:56:38,410 --> 02:56:41,371
You know what you are'?

1140
02:56:44,958 --> 02:56:48,086
Just a dirty son of a bitch!
