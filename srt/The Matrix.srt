1
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:50,093
Call: received

2
00:00:50,343 --> 00:00:53,763
<i>- Is everything in place?
- You're not to relieve me.</i>

3
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:56,641
<i>I know, but I felt like taking a shift.</i>

4
00:00:57,183 --> 00:00:59,561
<i>You like him, don't you?
You like watching him.</i>

5
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:02,814
<i>- Don't be ridiculous.
- We're going to kill him.</i>

6
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:05,525
<i>Morpheus believes he is the One.</i>

7
00:01:05,692 --> 00:01:06,735
<i>Do you?</i>

8
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:08,737
<i>It doesn't matter what I believe.</i>

9
00:01:08,987 --> 00:01:10,613
<i>You don't, do you?</i>

10
00:01:10,864 --> 00:01:12,949
<i>- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?</i>

11
00:01:13,158 --> 00:01:14,784
<i>Are you sure this line is clean?</i>

12
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:17,036
<i>Yeah, of course I'm sure.</i>

13
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,830
<i>I better go.</i>

14
00:01:56,785 --> 00:01:58,578
- Freeze! Police!
- Hands on your head!

15
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,205
Do it! Do it now!

16
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:24,229
- Lieutenant.
- Oh, shit.

17
00:02:25,063 --> 00:02:28,274
Lieutenant, you were given
specific orders.

18
00:02:28,525 --> 00:02:30,235
I'm just doing my job.

19
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,281
You give me that "juris-my-dick-tion"
crap, you can cram it up your ass.

20
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,243
The orders were for your protection.

21
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,955
I think we can handle one little girl.

22
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:48,837
I sent two units!

23
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:50,672
They're bringing her down now!

24
00:02:50,922 --> 00:02:54,050
No, lieutenant, your men
are already dead.

25
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:24,205
Shit.

26
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,210
Morpheus, the line was traced.
I don't know how.

27
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,087
<i>I know. They cut the hard line.</i>

28
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:33,464
<i>There's no time.
Get to another exit.</i>

29
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:36,134
- Are there any agents?
<i>- Yes.</i>

30
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:37,510
Goddamn it.

31
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,304
<i>You have to focus, Trinity.</i>

32
00:03:39,554 --> 00:03:41,931
<i>There's a phone at Wells and Lake.</i>

33
00:03:42,307 --> 00:03:43,975
<i>You can make it.</i>

34
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:45,894
- All right.
<i>- Go.</i>

35
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:49,082
That's impossible.

36
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:26,077
Get up, Trinity. Just get up.

37
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:27,954
Get up.

38
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,334
She got out.

39
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:16,919
It doesn't matter.

40
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:20,339
- The informant is real.
- Yes.

41
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:22,258
We have the name of their next target.

42
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:24,177
The name is Neo.

43
00:06:27,472 --> 00:06:28,973
We'll need a search running.

44
00:06:29,265 --> 00:06:31,184
It has already begun.

45
00:07:25,947 --> 00:07:27,156
What?

46
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:34,413
What the hell?

47
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:44,006
"Follow the white rabbit."

48
00:07:55,852 --> 00:07:57,019
Who is it?

49
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,563
It's Choi.

50
00:08:03,693 --> 00:08:05,528
Yeah. Yeah.

51
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:13,244
You're two hours late.

52
00:08:13,828 --> 00:08:15,580
I know. It's her fault.

53
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:16,831
You got the money?

54
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,126
Two grand.

55
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:22,128
Hold on.

56
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:41,189
Hallelujah.

57
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:44,317
You're my savior.
My own personal Jesus Christ.

58
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:46,444
You get caught using that....

59
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:48,821
I know. This never happened.
You don't exist.

60
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:52,033
- Right.
- Something wrong, man?

61
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:54,327
You look a little whiter than usual.

62
00:08:55,453 --> 00:08:57,622
My computer, it....

63
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:05,171
Ever have that feeling where you're
not sure if you're awake or dreaming?

64
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:08,716
All the time.
It's called mescaline.

65
00:09:09,217 --> 00:09:11,344
It's the only way to fly.

66
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,722
It just sounds like you
need to unplug.

67
00:09:15,473 --> 00:09:17,475
Get some R and R?

68
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:21,646
What do you think, Dujour?
Should we take him with us?

69
00:09:23,648 --> 00:09:24,857
Definitely.

70
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:28,194
No, I can't. I have work tomorrow.

71
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:29,946
Come on.

72
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:32,823
It'll be fun. I promise.

73
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,831
Yeah.

74
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,501
Sure. I'll go.

75
00:10:11,112 --> 00:10:12,196
Hello, Neo.

76
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:14,699
How do you know that name?

77
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:17,243
I know a lot about you.

78
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:20,204
- Who are you?
- My name is Trinity.

79
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:22,373
Trinity.

80
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,167
The Trinity?

81
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:27,336
That cracked the IRS D-base?

82
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,046
That was a long time ago.

83
00:10:29,297 --> 00:10:31,215
- Jesus.
- What?

84
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:33,467
I just thought...

85
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:36,387
...you were a guy.

86
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,097
Most guys do.

87
00:10:39,307 --> 00:10:41,517
That was you on my computer.

88
00:10:42,143 --> 00:10:43,227
How did you do that?

89
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:46,605
Right now, all I can tell you...

90
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:48,774
...is that you're in danger.

91
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:51,652
- I brought you here to warn you.
- Of what?

92
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:53,904
They're watching you, Neo.

93
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,907
- Who is?
- Please just listen.

94
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:02,246
I know why you're here, Neo.

95
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,999
I know what you've been doing.

96
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:07,126
I know why you hardly sleep...

97
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:10,546
...why you live alone and why,
night after night...

98
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:13,132
...you sit at your computer.

99
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,843
You're looking for him.

100
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:19,638
I know, because I was once
looking for the same thing.

101
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:22,266
And when he found me...

102
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:25,978
...he told me I wasn't really
looking for him...

103
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:28,647
...I was looking for an answer.

104
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:32,401
It's the question that drives us, Neo.

105
00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:35,738
It's the question
that brought you here.

106
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:39,200
You know the question...

107
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,951
...just as I did.

108
00:11:42,495 --> 00:11:44,121
What is the Matrix?

109
00:11:44,372 --> 00:11:46,832
The answer is out there, Neo.

110
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,502
It's looking for you.

111
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:51,962
And it will find you...

112
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:54,256
...if you want it to.

113
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,014
Shit.

114
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:03,391
Shit, shit.

115
00:12:13,651 --> 00:12:16,487
You have a problem with authority,
Mr. Anderson.

116
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:20,783
You believe that you are special,
that the rules do not apply to you.

117
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:23,494
Obviously, you are mistaken.

118
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:29,333
This is one of the top
software companies in the world...

119
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,962
...because employees understand
they are part of a whole.

120
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:37,842
Thus, if an employee has a problem,
the company has a problem.

121
00:12:40,094 --> 00:12:43,305
The time has come to make
a choice, Mr. Anderson.

122
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:48,060
Either you choose to be at your desk
on time from this day forth...

123
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:51,272
...or you choose to find another job.

124
00:12:52,148 --> 00:12:53,482
Do I make myself clear?

125
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:56,152
Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.
Perfectly clear.

126
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:05,494
Thomas Anderson?

127
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:09,165
Yeah, that's me.

128
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:11,167
Okay.

129
00:13:17,173 --> 00:13:18,340
Great.

130
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:20,926
Have a nice day.

131
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,443
Hello?

132
00:13:37,735 --> 00:13:41,071
<i>Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is?</i>

133
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:45,075
- Morpheus.
<i>- Yes.</i>

134
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:47,328
<i>I've been looking for you.</i>

135
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:50,748
<i>I don't know if you're ready to see
what I want to show you.</i>

136
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:54,168
<i>But unfortunately, you and I
have run out of time.</i>

137
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:58,130
<i>They're coming for you, and I don't know
what they're going to do.</i>

138
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,715
Who's coming for me?

139
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:02,051
<i>Stand up and see for yourself.</i>

140
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:03,802
What? Right now?

141
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:06,597
<i>Yes. Now.</i>

142
00:14:07,473 --> 00:14:09,350
<i>Do it slowly.</i>

143
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:10,976
<i>The elevator.</i>

144
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,650
- Oh, shit!
<i>- Yes.</i>

145
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:23,405
What do they want?

146
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:26,909
<i>I don't know. If you don't want
to find out, get out of there.</i>

147
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:28,118
How?

148
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:31,497
<i>I can guide you,
but you must do exactly as I say.</i>

149
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:34,375
- Okay.
<i>- The cubicle across from you is empty.</i>

150
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:39,630
- But what if they--
<i>- Go. Now.</i>

151
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:48,764
<i>Stay here for just a moment.</i>

152
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,732
<i>When I tell you,
go to the end of the row...</i>

153
00:14:58,983 --> 00:15:00,943
<i>...to the office
at the end of the hall.</i>

154
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:03,571
<i>Stay as low as you can.</i>

155
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:06,991
<i>Go. Now.</i>

156
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,925
<i>Good. Now, outside
there is a scaffold.</i>

157
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:29,972
- How do you know this?
<i>- We don't have time.</i>

158
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:33,058
<i>To your left there's a window.
Go to it.</i>

159
00:15:35,311 --> 00:15:36,854
<i>Open it.</i>

160
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:39,481
<i>Take the scaffold to the roof.</i>

161
00:15:39,732 --> 00:15:42,318
No way! No way!
This is crazy!

162
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:44,945
<i>There are two ways
out of this building.</i>

163
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:48,991
<i>One is that scaffold.
The other is in their custody.</i>

164
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:52,453
<i>You take a chance either way.
I leave it to you.</i>

165
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,791
This is insane!

166
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,836
Why is this happening to me?

167
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:02,755
What'd I do?

168
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,883
I'm nobody.
I didn't do anything.

169
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:07,926
I'm gonna die.

170
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:18,771
Shit!

171
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,167
Oh, shit!

172
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,924
I can't do this.

173
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:00,604
Shit.

174
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:54,700
As you can see, we've had our eye on
you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.

175
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:58,662
It seems that you've been living...

176
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,039
...two lives.

177
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,960
In one life,
you're Thomas A. Anderson...

178
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:08,547
...program writer for
a respectable software company.

179
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,885
You have a social security number.
You pay your taxes.

180
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:14,595
And you...

181
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,808
...help your landlady
carry out her garbage.

182
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:25,439
The other life is lived in computers...

183
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:28,692
...where you go by
the hacker alias "Neo"...

184
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:33,739
...and are guilty of virtually every
computer crime we have a law for.

185
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:36,992
One of these lives...

186
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:39,077
...has a future.

187
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:41,413
And one of them does not.

188
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:48,962
I'm going to be as forthcoming
as I can be, Mr. Anderson.

189
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,298
You're here...

190
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:53,884
...because we need your help.

191
00:18:57,513 --> 00:19:00,516
We know that you've been contacted
by a certain...

192
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:02,559
...individual.

193
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:07,523
A man who calls himself "Morpheus."

194
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:12,528
Whatever you think you know
about this man is irrelevant.

195
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:15,197
He is considered by many authorities...

196
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:18,492
...to be the most dangerous man alive.

197
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:22,412
My colleagues...

198
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:25,791
...believe that I am wasting
my time with you.

199
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:29,503
But I believe you wish
to do the right thing.

200
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:33,298
We're willing to wipe the slate clean...

201
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:35,801
...give you a fresh start.

202
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:39,221
All we're asking in return
is your cooperation...

203
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:42,975
...in bringing
a known terrorist to justice.

204
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:45,602
Yeah.

205
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,981
That sounds like a really good deal.

206
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:52,359
But I got a better one.

207
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,111
How about...

208
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:56,530
...I give you the finger...

209
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:01,118
...and you give me my phone call.

210
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:05,163
Mr. Anderson...

211
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:10,377
...you disappoint me.

212
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:13,255
You can't scare me
with this gestapo crap.

213
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:14,882
I know my rights.

214
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:16,633
I want my phone call.

215
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,386
Tell me, Mr. Anderson...

216
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:21,680
...what good is a phone call...

217
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:25,517
...if you're unable to speak?

218
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:01,511
You're going to help us,
Mr. Anderson...

219
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:04,181
...whether you want to or not.

220
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:05,867
<i>This line is tapped,
so I must be brief.</i>

221
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:10,414
<i>They got to you first, but they've
underestimated how important you are.</i>

222
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:12,499
<i>If they knew what I know...</i>

223
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:14,751
<i>...you would probably be dead.</i>

224
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:19,464
What are you talking about?
What is happening to me?

225
00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:24,553
<i>You are the One, Neo. You may have
spent the last few years...</i>

226
00:22:24,803 --> 00:22:27,764
<i>...looking for me, but I've spent
my entire life...</i>

227
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:29,516
<i>...looking for you.</i>

228
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:33,228
<i>Now, do you still want to meet?</i>

229
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:37,065
- Yes.
<i>- Then go to the Adams Street bridge.</i>

230
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:48,493
Get in.

231
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:01,590
What's this?

232
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,384
It's necessary, Neo.
For our protection.

233
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:06,803
- From what?
- From you.

234
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:09,806
- Take off your shirt.
- What?

235
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:11,141
Stop the car.

236
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:16,897
Listen, coppertop.

237
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:19,149
We don't have time for 20 Questions.

238
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:22,027
Right now, there's only one rule:

239
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,653
Our way...

240
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:25,072
...or the highway.

241
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,704
Fine.

242
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:37,042
Please, Neo, you have to trust me.

243
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:40,253
- Why?
- Because you have been down there.

244
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:42,214
You know that road.

245
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:44,841
You know exactly where it ends.

246
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:49,304
And I know that's
not where you want to be.

247
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:05,028
Apoc, lights.

248
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:09,699
Lie back.
Lift up your shirt.

249
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:13,870
- What's that?
- You're bugged.

250
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:23,088
Try and relax.

251
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:30,554
Come on.

252
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:32,639
Come on.

253
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:35,392
It's on the move.

254
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:38,395
Come on, you shit.

255
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,482
- You're gonna lose it.
- No, I'm not.

256
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:43,733
Clear!

257
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:54,452
Jesus Christ!
That thing's real!?

258
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:29,529
This is it.

259
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:35,327
Let me give you one piece of advice.

260
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:37,954
Be honest.

261
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:41,750
He knows more than you can imagine.

262
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:51,801
At last.

263
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:54,429
Welcome, Neo.

264
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:57,557
As you no doubt have guessed...

265
00:25:57,807 --> 00:25:59,059
...I am Morpheus.

266
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:01,686
It's an honor to meet you.

267
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:03,188
No...

268
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:05,065
...the honor is mine.

269
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:08,485
Please, come. Sit.

270
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,210
I imagine...

271
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:28,380
...that right now you're feeling
a bit like Alice...

272
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:32,509
...tumbling down the rabbit hole?

273
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:34,427
You could say that.

274
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:37,973
I can see it in your eyes.

275
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:41,851
You have the look of a man
who accepts what he sees...

276
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:44,354
...because he's expecting to wake up.

277
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:48,358
Ironically, this is not
far from the truth.

278
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:51,444
Do you believe in fate, Neo?

279
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:52,696
No.

280
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:54,155
Why not?

281
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:57,200
I don't like the idea that
I'm not in control of my life.

282
00:26:58,285 --> 00:27:01,621
I know exactly what you mean.

283
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:08,295
Let me tell you why you're here.

284
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:10,880
You know something.

285
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:13,049
What you know,
you can't explain.

286
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,135
But you feel it.

287
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:17,637
You felt it your entire life:

288
00:27:18,221 --> 00:27:22,392
Something's wrong with the world.
You don't know what, but it's there.

289
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:25,103
Like a splinter in your mind...

290
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:27,230
...driving you mad.

291
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:30,900
It is this feeling
that has brought you to me.

292
00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:35,280
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

293
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:38,450
The Matrix?

294
00:27:40,952 --> 00:27:42,620
Do you want to know...

295
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:45,081
...what it is?

296
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:49,336
The Matrix is everywhere.

297
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:51,296
It is all around us.

298
00:27:51,546 --> 00:27:53,506
Even now, in this very room.

299
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:56,551
You can see it when you
look out your window...

300
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:59,137
...or when you turn on your television.

301
00:27:59,554 --> 00:28:02,098
You can feel it when you go to work...

302
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:05,310
...when you go to church...

303
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:07,812
...when you pay your taxes.

304
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:11,858
It is the world that has been
pulled over your eyes...

305
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:13,693
...to blind you from the truth.

306
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:17,155
What truth?

307
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:22,952
That you are a slave.

308
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:26,748
Like everyone else,
you were born into bondage...

309
00:28:26,998 --> 00:28:31,669
...born into a prison that you cannot
smell or taste or touch.

310
00:28:31,961 --> 00:28:33,254
A prison...

311
00:28:33,505 --> 00:28:34,631
...for your mind.

312
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:43,973
Unfortunately, no one can be...

313
00:28:44,307 --> 00:28:46,684
...told what the Matrix is.

314
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:52,023
You have to see it for yourself.

315
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:03,827
This is your last chance.

316
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:06,413
After this, there is no turning back.

317
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:08,331
You take the blue pill...

318
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:11,709
...the story ends, you wake up
in your bed and believe...

319
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,753
...whatever you want to believe.

320
00:29:14,003 --> 00:29:15,338
You take the red pill...

321
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:17,549
...you stay in Wonderland...

322
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:20,760
...and I show you how deep
the rabbit hole goes.

323
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:31,855
Remember...

324
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:35,733
...all I'm offering is the truth.
Nothing more.

325
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,374
Follow me.

326
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:55,587
Apoc, are we on-line?

327
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:57,213
Almost.

328
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,594
Time is always against us.

329
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:04,471
Please take a seat there.

330
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:24,365
- You did all this?
- Mm-hm.

331
00:30:28,495 --> 00:30:30,497
The pill you took is
part of a trace program.

332
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:35,877
It disrupts your carrier signals
so we can pinpoint your location.

333
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:37,462
What does that mean?

334
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:40,215
It means buckle your
seat belt, Dorothy...

335
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:41,883
...because Kansas...

336
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:43,176
...is going bye-bye.

337
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:22,465
Did you...?

338
00:31:33,476 --> 00:31:37,564
Have you ever had a dream, Neo,
that you were so sure was real?

339
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:41,609
What if you were unable
to wake from that dream?

340
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:44,362
How would you know the difference
between the dream world...

341
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:46,406
...and the real world?

342
00:31:48,032 --> 00:31:49,200
This can't be.

343
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:50,410
Be what?

344
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,620
Be real?

345
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:58,001
- Going into replication.
- Apoc?

346
00:31:58,209 --> 00:31:59,210
Still nothing.

347
00:31:59,794 --> 00:32:01,004
It's cold.

348
00:32:01,254 --> 00:32:02,630
It's cold!

349
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:08,177
Tank, we'll need a signal soon.

350
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,348
- I got a fibrillation.
- Apoc, location.

351
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:14,058
Targeting almost there.

352
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:18,771
He's going into arrest.

353
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:21,524
- Lock. I got him!
- Now, Tank, now!

354
00:35:18,785 --> 00:35:19,869
Welcome...

355
00:35:20,203 --> 00:35:22,121
...to the real world.

356
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:25,374
We've done it, Trinity.

357
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:27,168
We found him.

358
00:35:27,418 --> 00:35:30,213
- I hope you're right.
- I don't have to hope.

359
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:32,381
I know it.

360
00:35:37,553 --> 00:35:38,596
Am I dead?

361
00:35:39,096 --> 00:35:41,265
Far from it.

362
00:35:55,238 --> 00:35:56,656
He still needs a lot of work.

363
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,283
What are you doing?

364
00:35:59,534 --> 00:36:01,744
Your muscles atrophied.
We're rebuilding them.

365
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:03,871
Why do my eyes hurt?

366
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,457
You've never used them before.

367
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:11,254
Rest, Neo.

368
00:36:11,504 --> 00:36:13,172
The answers are coming.

369
00:37:27,747 --> 00:37:29,332
Morpheus, what's happened to me?

370
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:31,042
What is this place?

371
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:33,961
More important than "what" is "when."

372
00:37:34,462 --> 00:37:35,504
"When"?

373
00:37:35,713 --> 00:37:37,757
You believe it's the year 1999...

374
00:37:38,007 --> 00:37:40,259
...when in fact, it's closer to 2199.

375
00:37:41,385 --> 00:37:44,138
I can't tell you exactly
what year it is...

376
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:46,015
...because we honestly don't know.

377
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:49,352
There's nothing I can say
that will explain it for you.

378
00:37:49,602 --> 00:37:52,355
Come with me.
See for yourself.

379
00:37:52,897 --> 00:37:54,649
This is my ship.

380
00:37:54,941 --> 00:37:57,860
The <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>
It's a hovercraft.

381
00:38:00,696 --> 00:38:02,448
This is the main deck.

382
00:38:08,204 --> 00:38:09,455
This is the core...

383
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:15,711
...where we broadcast our pirate signal
and hack into the Matrix.

384
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:22,259
Most of my crew you already know.

385
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:28,683
This is Apoc...

386
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:30,810
...Switch...

387
00:38:32,395 --> 00:38:33,562
- ...and Cypher.
- Hi.

388
00:38:33,813 --> 00:38:37,525
The ones you don't know:
Tank and his big brother, Dozer.

389
00:38:38,401 --> 00:38:40,820
The little one behind you is Mouse.

390
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:48,411
You wanted to know
what the Matrix is?

391
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:50,663
Trinity.

392
00:39:11,684 --> 00:39:13,269
Try to relax.

393
00:39:18,149 --> 00:39:19,984
This will feel a little weird.

394
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:33,330
This...

395
00:39:33,497 --> 00:39:35,207
...is the Construct.

396
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:37,752
It's our loading program.

397
00:39:38,002 --> 00:39:40,463
We can load anything, from clothing...

398
00:39:40,713 --> 00:39:42,089
...to equipment...

399
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:43,716
...weapons...

400
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:46,177
...training simulations...

401
00:39:46,552 --> 00:39:49,096
...anything we need.

402
00:39:51,891 --> 00:39:54,310
Right now we're inside
a computer program?

403
00:39:54,602 --> 00:39:56,520
Is it really so hard to believe?

404
00:39:57,021 --> 00:39:59,648
Your clothes are different.
The plugs in your body are gone.

405
00:40:00,858 --> 00:40:02,943
Your hair has changed.

406
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:06,655
Your appearance now is what we call
"residual self-image."

407
00:40:07,364 --> 00:40:09,992
It is the mental projection
of your digital self.

408
00:40:15,873 --> 00:40:16,999
This isn't real?

409
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:18,793
What is "real"?

410
00:40:19,168 --> 00:40:21,420
How do you define "real"?

411
00:40:21,712 --> 00:40:23,631
If you're talking about
what you can feel...

412
00:40:23,881 --> 00:40:26,300
...what you can smell, taste and see...

413
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:30,429
...then "real" is simply electrical
signals interpreted by your brain.

414
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,019
This is the world that you know.

415
00:40:38,437 --> 00:40:41,482
The world as it was at the end
of the 20th century.

416
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:48,197
It exists now only as part of
a neural-interactive simulation...

417
00:40:48,447 --> 00:40:49,698
...that we call the Matrix.

418
00:40:54,245 --> 00:40:57,039
You've been living
in a dream world, Neo.

419
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,166
This is the world...

420
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:01,210
...as it exists today.

421
00:41:14,265 --> 00:41:17,226
Welcome to "the desert...

422
00:41:18,102 --> 00:41:19,687
...of the real."

423
00:41:23,065 --> 00:41:25,442
We have only bits and pieces
of information.

424
00:41:25,693 --> 00:41:29,488
But what we know for certain
is that in the early 21st century...

425
00:41:29,738 --> 00:41:32,992
...all of mankind was united
in celebration.

426
00:41:33,242 --> 00:41:37,997
We marveled at our own magnificence
as we gave birth to AI.

427
00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:39,915
AI.

428
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:42,334
You mean artificial intelligence.

429
00:41:42,585 --> 00:41:47,006
A singular consciousness that spawned
an entire race of machines.

430
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,302
We don't know who struck first,
us or them.

431
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:54,930
But we know that it was us
that scorched the sky.

432
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:58,767
They were dependent on solar power...

433
00:41:59,018 --> 00:42:02,354
...and it was believed that
they would be unable to survive...

434
00:42:02,688 --> 00:42:06,192
...without an energy source
as abundant as the sun.

435
00:42:06,442 --> 00:42:11,322
Throughout human history, we have
been dependent on machines to survive.

436
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:16,994
Fate, it seems, is not
without a sense of irony.

437
00:42:20,206 --> 00:42:24,627
The human body generates more
bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.

438
00:42:24,877 --> 00:42:29,006
And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.

439
00:42:30,925 --> 00:42:33,093
Combined with a form of fusion...

440
00:42:33,427 --> 00:42:38,265
...the machines had found all the energy
they would ever need.

441
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:46,065
There are fields, Neo,
endless fields...

442
00:42:46,315 --> 00:42:49,568
...where human beings
are no longer born.

443
00:42:50,277 --> 00:42:52,112
We are grown.

444
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,746
For the longest time,
I wouldn't believe it.

445
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:03,666
And then I saw the fields
with my own eyes...

446
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,627
...watched them liquefy the dead...

447
00:43:06,877 --> 00:43:10,214
...so they could be fed intravenously
to the living.

448
00:43:10,756 --> 00:43:15,010
And standing there,
facing the pure, horrifying precision...

449
00:43:15,261 --> 00:43:18,180
...I came to realize
the obviousness of the truth.

450
00:43:20,808 --> 00:43:22,601
What is the Matrix?

451
00:43:23,811 --> 00:43:24,853
Control.

452
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:29,608
The Matrix is a computer-generated
dream world...

453
00:43:30,401 --> 00:43:33,487
...built to keep us under control...

454
00:43:34,655 --> 00:43:37,825
...in order to change a human being...

455
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:39,618
...into this.

456
00:43:40,995 --> 00:43:42,121
No.

457
00:43:43,747 --> 00:43:45,332
I don't believe it.

458
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:46,917
It's not possible.

459
00:43:47,501 --> 00:43:52,089
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.
I just said it would be the truth.

460
00:43:52,339 --> 00:43:53,632
Stop!

461
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:55,384
Let me out!

462
00:43:56,093 --> 00:43:58,012
Let me out! I want out!

463
00:43:59,972 --> 00:44:02,641
- Easy, Neo. Easy.
- Get this thing out of me.

464
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:04,560
Get this thing out of me!

465
00:44:06,353 --> 00:44:07,855
Don't touch me!

466
00:44:08,105 --> 00:44:09,732
Stay away from me!

467
00:44:10,149 --> 00:44:11,650
I don't believe it.

468
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:13,569
I don't believe it.

469
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:15,321
I don't believe it.

470
00:44:15,571 --> 00:44:17,614
- He's gonna pop.
- Breathe, Neo.

471
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:19,074
Just breathe.

472
00:44:37,468 --> 00:44:39,261
I can't go back, can I?

473
00:44:40,095 --> 00:44:41,513
No.

474
00:44:42,348 --> 00:44:43,557
But if you could...

475
00:44:44,391 --> 00:44:45,893
...would you really want to?

476
00:44:48,395 --> 00:44:49,772
I owe you an apology.

477
00:44:50,356 --> 00:44:51,732
We have a rule.

478
00:44:52,191 --> 00:44:55,444
We never free a mind
once it's reached a certain age.

479
00:44:55,611 --> 00:44:56,695
It's dangerous.

480
00:44:57,404 --> 00:44:59,114
The mind has trouble letting go.

481
00:44:59,365 --> 00:45:01,658
I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.

482
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:04,787
I did what I did because...

483
00:45:05,496 --> 00:45:06,955
...I had to.

484
00:45:15,381 --> 00:45:19,468
When the Matrix was first built,
there was a man born inside...

485
00:45:19,968 --> 00:45:23,764
...who had the ability
to change whatever he wanted...

486
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:27,059
...to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.

487
00:45:28,811 --> 00:45:32,272
It was he who freed the first of us...

488
00:45:33,148 --> 00:45:34,775
...taught us the truth.

489
00:45:36,235 --> 00:45:39,321
As long as the Matrix exists...

490
00:45:39,655 --> 00:45:41,740
...the human race will never be free.

491
00:45:45,953 --> 00:45:47,496
After he died...

492
00:45:48,247 --> 00:45:50,958
...the Oracle prophesied his return...

493
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,711
...and that his coming would hail
the destruction of the Matrix...

494
00:45:54,962 --> 00:45:56,630
...end the war...

495
00:45:56,964 --> 00:45:58,215
...bring freedom to our people.

496
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:04,179
That is why there are those of us who
spent our lives searching the Matrix...

497
00:46:04,513 --> 00:46:06,098
...looking for him.

498
00:46:08,517 --> 00:46:10,602
I did what I did because...

499
00:46:12,229 --> 00:46:14,356
...I believe that search is over.

500
00:46:19,445 --> 00:46:20,863
Get some rest.

501
00:46:21,488 --> 00:46:23,282
You're going to need it.

502
00:46:25,993 --> 00:46:27,035
For what?

503
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,290
Your training.

504
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,310
Morning. Did you sleep?

505
00:46:52,186 --> 00:46:53,395
You will tonight.

506
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:55,314
I guarantee it.

507
00:46:56,815 --> 00:46:58,734
I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.

508
00:46:59,193 --> 00:47:01,612
- You don't have any--
- Holes? Nope.

509
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:07,242
Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100%
pure, old-fashioned, homegrown human.

510
00:47:07,493 --> 00:47:08,702
Born free right here...

511
00:47:09,244 --> 00:47:10,579
...in the real world.

512
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:12,498
Genuine child of Zion.

513
00:47:13,332 --> 00:47:15,792
- Zion?
- If the war was over tomorrow...

514
00:47:16,043 --> 00:47:17,544
...Zion's where the party would be.

515
00:47:17,961 --> 00:47:19,254
It's a city?

516
00:47:19,505 --> 00:47:22,674
The last human city.
The only place we have left.

517
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:25,511
Where is it?

518
00:47:27,262 --> 00:47:30,682
Deep underground near the Earth's core,
where it's still warm.

519
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:34,186
You live long enough,
you might see it.

520
00:47:36,438 --> 00:47:41,276
Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm excited
to see what you're capable of...

521
00:47:41,527 --> 00:47:43,278
...if Morpheus is right and all.

522
00:47:43,779 --> 00:47:46,532
We're not supposed to
talk about this, but...

523
00:47:46,782 --> 00:47:48,200
...if you are...

524
00:47:49,284 --> 00:47:51,286
...it's a very exciting time.

525
00:47:52,329 --> 00:47:55,040
We got a lot to do.
We gotta get to it.

526
00:47:58,961 --> 00:48:01,880
We're supposed to start
with these programs first.

527
00:48:02,881 --> 00:48:06,343
That's major boring shit.
Let's do something more fun.

528
00:48:06,677 --> 00:48:08,136
How about...

529
00:48:09,721 --> 00:48:11,473
...combat training?

530
00:48:17,521 --> 00:48:18,981
"Jujitsu"?

531
00:48:19,856 --> 00:48:21,525
I'm going to learn jujitsu?

532
00:48:32,869 --> 00:48:34,079
Holy shit!

533
00:48:34,329 --> 00:48:36,665
"Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."

534
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:38,292
How about some more?

535
00:48:38,542 --> 00:48:39,835
Hell, yes.

536
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:42,963
Hell, yeah.

537
00:48:55,142 --> 00:48:56,226
How is he?

538
00:48:56,476 --> 00:48:58,645
Ten hours straight.
He's a machine.

539
00:49:09,865 --> 00:49:11,241
I know kung fu.

540
00:49:12,909 --> 00:49:13,910
Show me.

541
00:49:15,704 --> 00:49:17,456
This is a sparring program...

542
00:49:17,706 --> 00:49:20,500
...similar to the programmed reality
of the Matrix.

543
00:49:20,751 --> 00:49:23,086
It has the same basic rules.
Like gravity.

544
00:49:23,337 --> 00:49:26,798
These rules are no different
than those of a computer system.

545
00:49:27,341 --> 00:49:28,842
Some of them can be bent.

546
00:49:29,051 --> 00:49:31,511
Others can be broken.

547
00:49:32,054 --> 00:49:33,138
Understand?

548
00:49:34,222 --> 00:49:35,265
Then hit me...

549
00:49:35,849 --> 00:49:36,975
...if you can.

550
00:50:15,972 --> 00:50:17,015
Good!

551
00:50:17,766 --> 00:50:18,934
Adaptation.

552
00:50:19,226 --> 00:50:20,435
Improvisation.

553
00:50:20,727 --> 00:50:22,062
But your weakness...

554
00:50:22,312 --> 00:50:23,689
...is not your technique.

555
00:50:30,654 --> 00:50:32,739
Morpheus is fighting Neo.

556
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:46,188
How did I beat you?

557
00:51:52,778 --> 00:51:53,862
You're too fast.

558
00:51:54,404 --> 00:51:55,739
Do you believe that...

559
00:51:56,114 --> 00:51:58,617
...my being stronger or faster...

560
00:51:58,867 --> 00:52:02,537
...has anything to do
with my muscles in this place?

561
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:08,376
You think you're breathing air?

562
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:23,099
Again!

563
00:52:34,569 --> 00:52:36,988
Jesus Christ, he's fast!

564
00:52:37,239 --> 00:52:39,449
His neuro-kinetics
are way above normal.

565
00:52:44,913 --> 00:52:46,373
What are you waiting for?

566
00:52:46,623 --> 00:52:48,583
You're faster than this.

567
00:52:50,794 --> 00:52:53,004
Don't think you are.

568
00:52:53,255 --> 00:52:54,923
Know you are.

569
00:53:05,308 --> 00:53:08,103
Come on! Stop trying to hit me,
and hit me!

570
00:53:18,029 --> 00:53:19,781
I don't believe it.

571
00:53:21,324 --> 00:53:23,451
I know what you're trying to do.

572
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,289
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.

573
00:53:27,622 --> 00:53:29,708
But I can only show you the door.

574
00:53:30,292 --> 00:53:32,127
You have to walk through it.

575
00:53:34,504 --> 00:53:36,631
Tank, load the jump program.

576
00:53:48,226 --> 00:53:50,937
You have to let it all go, Neo.
Fear...

577
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:53,648
...doubt and disbelief.

578
00:53:54,816 --> 00:53:57,527
Free your mind.

579
00:54:05,785 --> 00:54:06,912
Whoa.

580
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:15,420
Okey-dokey.

581
00:54:17,505 --> 00:54:18,673
Free my mind.

582
00:54:19,132 --> 00:54:20,258
What if he makes it?

583
00:54:20,508 --> 00:54:23,219
- No one's ever made their first jump.
- I know.

584
00:54:24,554 --> 00:54:27,015
- But what if he does?
- He won't.

585
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:28,683
Come on.

586
00:54:28,934 --> 00:54:30,101
All right.

587
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,604
No problem. Free my mind.

588
00:54:33,396 --> 00:54:36,191
Free my mind. No problem. Right.

589
00:54:55,585 --> 00:54:57,253
What does that mean?

590
00:54:57,629 --> 00:54:59,464
It doesn't mean anything.

591
00:55:00,048 --> 00:55:02,634
Everybody falls the first time.

592
00:55:03,093 --> 00:55:04,386
Right, Trin?

593
00:55:25,073 --> 00:55:27,701
- I thought it wasn't real.
- Your mind makes it real.

594
00:55:30,954 --> 00:55:33,206
If you're killed in the Matrix...

595
00:55:33,373 --> 00:55:34,416
...you die here?

596
00:55:35,041 --> 00:55:37,502
The body cannot live without the mind.

597
00:56:07,991 --> 00:56:11,369
I don't remember you ever
bringing me dinner.

598
00:56:14,456 --> 00:56:17,292
There is something about him,
isn't there?

599
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:19,544
You're a believer now?

600
00:56:20,545 --> 00:56:21,755
I keep wondering...

601
00:56:22,005 --> 00:56:25,675
...if Morpheus is so sure,
why not take him to see the Oracle?

602
00:56:26,593 --> 00:56:29,512
Morpheus will take him
when he's ready.

603
00:56:39,314 --> 00:56:40,857
The Matrix is a system, Neo.

604
00:56:42,609 --> 00:56:43,902
That system is our enemy.

605
00:56:44,527 --> 00:56:46,863
But when you're inside,
what do you see?

606
00:56:47,113 --> 00:56:50,909
Businessmen, teachers,
lawyers, carpenters.

607
00:56:51,367 --> 00:56:53,953
The very minds of the people
we are trying to save.

608
00:56:54,204 --> 00:56:57,165
But until we do, these people are
a part of that system...

609
00:56:57,415 --> 00:56:59,334
...and that makes them our enemy.

610
00:56:59,501 --> 00:57:00,710
You have to understand...

611
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,297
...most of these people are not
ready to be unplugged.

612
00:57:04,547 --> 00:57:06,132
And many of them are so inert...

613
00:57:06,382 --> 00:57:08,802
...so hopelessly dependent
on the system...

614
00:57:09,052 --> 00:57:11,763
...that they will fight to protect it.

615
00:57:13,264 --> 00:57:17,018
Were you listening to me or looking
at the woman in the red dress?

616
00:57:17,185 --> 00:57:18,937
- I was--
- Look again.

617
00:57:20,188 --> 00:57:21,272
Freeze it.

618
00:57:27,904 --> 00:57:29,531
- This isn't the Matrix?
- No.

619
00:57:31,324 --> 00:57:35,161
It's another training program
designed to teach you one thing:

620
00:57:35,787 --> 00:57:38,206
If you are not one of us,
you are one of them.

621
00:57:38,748 --> 00:57:41,543
- What are they?
- Sentient programs.

622
00:57:42,293 --> 00:57:46,589
They can move in and out of any
software still hardwired to their system.

623
00:57:46,965 --> 00:57:50,343
That means that anyone
we haven't unplugged...

624
00:57:50,677 --> 00:57:52,011
...is potentially an agent.

625
00:57:52,971 --> 00:57:54,806
Inside the Matrix...

626
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:57,100
...they are everyone...

627
00:57:57,433 --> 00:57:59,144
...and they are no one.

628
00:57:59,394 --> 00:58:02,522
We have survived by hiding
and running from them...

629
00:58:02,772 --> 00:58:04,399
...but they are the gatekeepers.

630
00:58:04,649 --> 00:58:07,610
They're guarding all the doors
and holding all the keys.

631
00:58:07,861 --> 00:58:10,697
Sooner or later, someone will
have to fight them.

632
00:58:10,864 --> 00:58:12,073
Someone?

633
00:58:12,407 --> 00:58:13,825
I won't lie to you, Neo.

634
00:58:14,284 --> 00:58:19,122
Every single man or woman who
has fought an agent, has died.

635
00:58:19,372 --> 00:58:21,749
But where they have failed,
you will succeed.

636
00:58:21,916 --> 00:58:23,001
Why?

637
00:58:23,251 --> 00:58:25,545
I've seen an agent punch
through a concrete wall.

638
00:58:25,795 --> 00:58:29,382
Men have emptied entire clips at them
and hit nothing but air.

639
00:58:29,632 --> 00:58:34,262
Yet their strength and speed are still
based in a world built on rules.

640
00:58:34,512 --> 00:58:35,638
Because of that...

641
00:58:35,889 --> 00:58:39,267
...they will never be as strong
or as fast as you can be.

642
00:58:43,563 --> 00:58:45,440
What are you telling me?

643
00:58:46,149 --> 00:58:47,609
That I can dodge bullets?

644
00:58:49,611 --> 00:58:50,987
No, Neo.

645
00:58:51,487 --> 00:58:54,407
I'm trying to tell you
that when you're ready...

646
00:58:55,283 --> 00:58:56,618
...you won't have to.

647
00:59:00,747 --> 00:59:01,956
<i>We got trouble.</i>

648
00:59:20,892 --> 00:59:23,353
- Did Zion send the warning?
- No, another ship.

649
00:59:26,606 --> 00:59:27,899
Shit.

650
00:59:28,149 --> 00:59:31,027
- Squiddy's sweeping in quick.
- Squiddy?

651
00:59:31,236 --> 00:59:34,447
A sentinel. A killing machine
designed for one thing.

652
00:59:34,697 --> 00:59:35,907
Search and destroy.

653
00:59:37,242 --> 00:59:38,409
Set her down there.

654
00:59:59,681 --> 01:00:01,182
How are we doing, Tank?

655
01:00:09,899 --> 01:00:11,067
Power off-line.

656
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:13,528
EMP armed...

657
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:15,613
- ...and ready.
- EMP?

658
01:00:15,905 --> 01:00:17,782
Electromagnetic pulse.

659
01:00:18,032 --> 01:00:20,910
Disables any electrical system
in the blast radius.

660
01:00:21,077 --> 01:00:23,371
It's the only weapon we have
against the machines.

661
01:00:29,168 --> 01:00:32,297
- Where are we?
- Their old service and waste systems.

662
01:00:33,548 --> 01:00:34,674
Sewers.

663
01:00:34,882 --> 01:00:37,593
There used to be cities
that spanned hundreds of miles.

664
01:00:38,094 --> 01:00:40,013
Now these sewers are
all that's left.

665
01:00:40,263 --> 01:00:41,597
Quiet.

666
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:23,639
Whoa! Neo.

667
01:01:25,475 --> 01:01:27,643
You scared the bejesus out of me.

668
01:01:28,728 --> 01:01:30,646
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

669
01:01:33,149 --> 01:01:34,400
Is that...?

670
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:36,235
The Matrix?

671
01:01:36,402 --> 01:01:37,612
Yeah.

672
01:01:39,405 --> 01:01:42,575
- Do you always look at it encoded?
- Well, you have to.

673
01:01:42,825 --> 01:01:45,912
The image translators work
for the construct program.

674
01:01:46,162 --> 01:01:49,582
But there's way too much information
to decode the Matrix.

675
01:01:49,832 --> 01:01:52,794
You get used to it.
I don't even see the code.

676
01:01:53,044 --> 01:01:56,464
All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.

677
01:01:57,632 --> 01:01:59,008
Do you...

678
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:00,385
...want a drink?

679
01:02:00,635 --> 01:02:01,677
Sure.

680
01:02:05,223 --> 01:02:06,682
You know...

681
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,143
...I know what you're thinking.

682
01:02:09,394 --> 01:02:11,479
Because right now I'm thinking
the same thing.

683
01:02:11,813 --> 01:02:15,149
Actually, I've been thinking it
ever since I got here.

684
01:02:17,068 --> 01:02:20,071
Why, oh, why didn't I take
the blue pill?

685
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:34,377
Good shit, huh?

686
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:35,920
Dozer makes it.

687
01:02:36,379 --> 01:02:37,547
It's good for two things:

688
01:02:37,797 --> 01:02:40,883
Degreasing engines and
killing brain cells.

689
01:02:41,884 --> 01:02:44,095
So can I ask you something?

690
01:02:47,098 --> 01:02:48,724
Did he tell you why he did it?

691
01:02:51,352 --> 01:02:53,187
Why you're here?

692
01:02:56,858 --> 01:02:58,609
Jesus!

693
01:02:59,819 --> 01:03:01,737
What a mind job.

694
01:03:03,156 --> 01:03:05,950
So you're here to save the world.

695
01:03:07,452 --> 01:03:09,537
What do you say
to something like that?

696
01:03:14,709 --> 01:03:16,085
A little piece of advice.

697
01:03:17,879 --> 01:03:19,297
You see an agent...

698
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:21,924
...you do what we do:

699
01:03:22,258 --> 01:03:23,801
Run.

700
01:03:24,135 --> 01:03:25,887
You run your ass off.

701
01:03:33,144 --> 01:03:34,854
Thanks for the drink.

702
01:03:39,567 --> 01:03:40,735
Sweet dreams.

703
01:03:44,739 --> 01:03:48,159
Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?

704
01:03:48,826 --> 01:03:49,952
You know...

705
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:53,831
...I know this steak doesn't exist.

706
01:03:54,832 --> 01:03:57,585
I know that when I put it
in my mouth...

707
01:03:57,835 --> 01:04:00,922
...the Matrix is telling my brain
that it is...

708
01:04:01,214 --> 01:04:02,340
...juicy...

709
01:04:02,632 --> 01:04:04,342
...and delicious.

710
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:08,513
After nine years...

711
01:04:09,555 --> 01:04:11,098
...you know what I realize?

712
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:20,149
Ignorance is bliss.

713
01:04:25,196 --> 01:04:27,031
Then we have a deal.

714
01:04:29,534 --> 01:04:31,452
I don't want to remember nothing.

715
01:04:31,702 --> 01:04:34,205
Nothing. You understand?

716
01:04:38,084 --> 01:04:40,086
And I want to be rich.

717
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:44,131
You know, someone important.

718
01:04:45,633 --> 01:04:46,759
Like an actor.

719
01:04:47,969 --> 01:04:51,097
Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.

720
01:04:53,266 --> 01:04:54,809
Okay.

721
01:04:55,184 --> 01:04:57,603
You get my body
back in a power plant...

722
01:04:57,979 --> 01:04:59,730
...reinsert me into the Matrix...

723
01:05:00,064 --> 01:05:01,482
...I'll get you what you want.

724
01:05:01,732 --> 01:05:03,734
Access codes to the Zion mainframe.

725
01:05:03,985 --> 01:05:06,153
No. I told you, I don't know them.

726
01:05:09,115 --> 01:05:11,117
I can get you the man who does.

727
01:05:11,867 --> 01:05:13,661
Morpheus.

728
01:05:23,754 --> 01:05:27,216
Here you go, buddy.
Breakfast of champions.

729
01:05:28,551 --> 01:05:31,345
Close your eyes, it feels
like you're eating runny eggs.

730
01:05:31,554 --> 01:05:33,264
Or a bowl of snot.

731
01:05:33,806 --> 01:05:35,391
You know what it reminds me of?

732
01:05:37,226 --> 01:05:39,562
Tastee Wheat. Did you
ever eat Tastee Wheat?

733
01:05:40,187 --> 01:05:41,897
No, but technically,
neither did you.

734
01:05:42,148 --> 01:05:44,191
That's exactly my point. Exactly.

735
01:05:44,442 --> 01:05:45,818
Because you have to wonder...

736
01:05:46,068 --> 01:05:49,322
...how do the machines really know
what Tastee Wheat tasted like?

737
01:05:49,572 --> 01:05:50,990
Maybe they got it wrong.

738
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:54,452
Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat
tasted like, actually tasted like...

739
01:05:54,744 --> 01:05:56,746
...oatmeal or tuna fish.

740
01:05:57,121 --> 01:05:59,957
That makes you wonder.
Take chicken, for example.

741
01:06:00,207 --> 01:06:02,209
Maybe they didn't know
what to make it taste like...

742
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:04,503
...which is why it tastes
like everything.

743
01:06:04,754 --> 01:06:06,547
- And maybe they--
- Shut up.

744
01:06:08,174 --> 01:06:09,634
It's a single-celled protein...

745
01:06:09,884 --> 01:06:12,928
...combined with synthetic aminos,
vitamins and minerals.

746
01:06:13,179 --> 01:06:14,430
Everything the body needs.

747
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:17,558
It doesn't have everything
the body needs.

748
01:06:20,311 --> 01:06:23,397
I understand you've run through
the agent training program.

749
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,484
You know, I wrote that program.

750
01:06:26,776 --> 01:06:28,069
Here it comes.

751
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:30,279
- What did you think of her?
- Of who?

752
01:06:30,655 --> 01:06:33,699
The woman in the red dress.
I designed her.

753
01:06:34,033 --> 01:06:36,786
She doesn't talk very much...

754
01:06:37,036 --> 01:06:40,998
...but if you'd like to meet her,
I can arrange a more personal milieu.

755
01:06:41,248 --> 01:06:42,625
The digital pimp hard at work.

756
01:06:42,875 --> 01:06:45,127
Pay no attention to
these hypocrites, Neo.

757
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:48,255
To deny our own impulses...

758
01:06:48,506 --> 01:06:51,634
...is to deny the very thing
that makes us human.

759
01:06:53,552 --> 01:06:54,929
Dozer, when you're done...

760
01:06:55,137 --> 01:06:56,722
...bring the ship up to broadcast depth.

761
01:06:57,306 --> 01:06:58,641
We're going in.

762
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:00,768
I'm taking Neo to see her.

763
01:07:04,689 --> 01:07:05,940
See who?

764
01:07:06,941 --> 01:07:08,192
The Oracle.

765
01:07:13,698 --> 01:07:15,241
Everyone please observe...

766
01:07:15,574 --> 01:07:18,285
...the "fasten seat belt"
and "no smoking" signs are on.

767
01:07:18,786 --> 01:07:22,164
Sit back and enjoy your flight.

768
01:07:46,605 --> 01:07:47,606
We're in.

769
01:08:03,247 --> 01:08:04,415
We'll be back in an hour.

770
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:21,182
Unbelievable...

771
01:08:21,432 --> 01:08:22,767
...isn't it?

772
01:08:26,353 --> 01:08:28,189
- God!
- What?

773
01:08:28,856 --> 01:08:30,232
I used to eat there.

774
01:08:32,485 --> 01:08:34,111
Really good noodles.

775
01:08:38,908 --> 01:08:41,410
I have these memories from my life.

776
01:08:43,871 --> 01:08:45,539
None of them happened.

777
01:08:46,248 --> 01:08:47,500
What does that mean?

778
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:49,960
That the Matrix cannot tell you
who you are.

779
01:08:50,878 --> 01:08:52,087
But an oracle can?

780
01:08:52,546 --> 01:08:53,756
That's different.

781
01:08:58,469 --> 01:08:59,720
Did you go to her?

782
01:09:01,263 --> 01:09:02,431
Yes.

783
01:09:02,932 --> 01:09:04,308
What did she tell you?

784
01:09:07,561 --> 01:09:09,063
She told me....

785
01:09:10,105 --> 01:09:11,273
What?

786
01:09:15,069 --> 01:09:16,403
We're here.

787
01:09:16,779 --> 01:09:19,073
Neo, come with me.

788
01:09:39,051 --> 01:09:41,470
So is this the same oracle
that made...

789
01:09:41,637 --> 01:09:42,888
...the prophecy?

790
01:09:43,138 --> 01:09:47,476
Yes. She's very old. She's been
with us since the beginning.

791
01:09:47,935 --> 01:09:49,937
- The beginning?
- Of the Resistance.

792
01:09:52,189 --> 01:09:54,567
And she knows what? Everything?

793
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:58,529
She would say she knows enough.

794
01:09:59,655 --> 01:10:01,448
And she's never wrong.

795
01:10:03,659 --> 01:10:06,829
Try not to think of it
in terms of right and wrong.

796
01:10:07,162 --> 01:10:08,747
She is a guide, Neo.

797
01:10:09,123 --> 01:10:11,000
She can help you to find the path.

798
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:12,751
She helped you?

799
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:14,503
Yes.

800
01:10:15,254 --> 01:10:16,589
What did she tell you?

801
01:10:19,049 --> 01:10:21,260
That I would find the One.

802
01:10:34,398 --> 01:10:36,525
I told you I can only
show you the door.

803
01:10:37,234 --> 01:10:39,320
You have to walk through it.

804
01:10:43,115 --> 01:10:44,199
Hello, Neo.

805
01:10:44,450 --> 01:10:46,118
You're right on time.

806
01:10:54,043 --> 01:10:57,838
Make yourself at home, Morpheus.
Neo, come with me.

807
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:05,095
These are the other Potentials.

808
01:11:05,346 --> 01:11:06,889
You can wait here.

809
01:11:47,721 --> 01:11:50,265
Do not try and bend the spoon.

810
01:11:50,641 --> 01:11:52,768
That's impossible.

811
01:11:53,602 --> 01:11:57,606
Instead, only try
to realize the truth.

812
01:11:58,148 --> 01:11:59,525
What truth?

813
01:11:59,775 --> 01:12:01,443
There is no spoon.

814
01:12:04,029 --> 01:12:05,364
There is no spoon?

815
01:12:05,614 --> 01:12:10,077
Then you'll see that it is not the spoon
that bends. It is only yourself.

816
01:12:26,135 --> 01:12:27,594
The Oracle will you see now.

817
01:12:38,313 --> 01:12:39,857
I know you're Neo.

818
01:12:40,482 --> 01:12:41,650
Be right with you.

819
01:12:42,693 --> 01:12:45,070
- You're the Oracle?
- Bingo.

820
01:12:47,781 --> 01:12:50,659
Not quite what you
were expecting, right?

821
01:12:51,702 --> 01:12:53,871
Almost done.

822
01:12:56,373 --> 01:12:58,000
Smell good, don't they?

823
01:12:59,251 --> 01:13:00,502
Yeah.

824
01:13:00,753 --> 01:13:02,588
I'd ask you to sit down...

825
01:13:02,838 --> 01:13:05,215
...but you're not going to anyway.

826
01:13:05,716 --> 01:13:08,594
- And don't worry about the vase.
- What vase?

827
01:13:11,722 --> 01:13:12,890
That vase.

828
01:13:13,849 --> 01:13:14,892
I'm sorry.

829
01:13:15,142 --> 01:13:17,019
I said, don't worry about it.

830
01:13:18,187 --> 01:13:20,147
I'll get one of my kids to fix it.

831
01:13:20,773 --> 01:13:21,982
How did you know?

832
01:13:24,026 --> 01:13:27,821
What's really going to bake
your noodle later on is...

833
01:13:28,155 --> 01:13:31,116
...would you still have broken it
if I hadn't said anything?

834
01:13:35,913 --> 01:13:37,831
You're cuter than I thought.

835
01:13:40,876 --> 01:13:43,128
I can see why she likes you.

836
01:13:44,004 --> 01:13:45,089
Who?

837
01:13:45,339 --> 01:13:47,174
Not too bright, though.

838
01:13:50,469 --> 01:13:53,555
You know why Morpheus
brought you to see me.

839
01:13:55,682 --> 01:13:56,850
So...

840
01:13:57,810 --> 01:13:59,186
...what do you think?

841
01:14:01,021 --> 01:14:02,773
Do you think you are the One?

842
01:14:04,733 --> 01:14:05,776
I don't know.

843
01:14:09,196 --> 01:14:10,614
You know what that means?

844
01:14:11,448 --> 01:14:12,616
It's Latin.

845
01:14:12,991 --> 01:14:15,202
Means, "Know thyself."

846
01:14:16,662 --> 01:14:18,622
I'll let you in on a little secret.

847
01:14:20,874 --> 01:14:24,711
Being the One is just
like being in love.

848
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:28,298
No one can tell you you're in love.
You just know it...

849
01:14:28,549 --> 01:14:29,675
...through and through.

850
01:14:30,008 --> 01:14:32,052
Balls to bones.

851
01:14:34,388 --> 01:14:35,430
Well...

852
01:14:37,391 --> 01:14:39,476
...I'd better have a look at you.

853
01:14:40,811 --> 01:14:42,312
Open your mouth. Say, "Ah."

854
01:14:56,702 --> 01:14:58,370
Okay....

855
01:14:58,996 --> 01:15:03,959
Now I'm supposed to say,
"Hmm, that's interesting, but...."

856
01:15:04,459 --> 01:15:05,586
Then you say:

857
01:15:06,253 --> 01:15:07,462
But what?

858
01:15:07,713 --> 01:15:11,675
But you already know
what I'm going to tell you.

859
01:15:13,093 --> 01:15:16,054
- I'm not the One.
- Sorry, kid.

860
01:15:17,681 --> 01:15:19,683
You got the gift...

861
01:15:20,601 --> 01:15:22,895
...but it looks like
you're waiting for something.

862
01:15:27,566 --> 01:15:28,609
What?

863
01:15:28,859 --> 01:15:31,737
Your next life, maybe. Who knows?

864
01:15:32,321 --> 01:15:34,573
That's the way these things go.

865
01:15:35,449 --> 01:15:38,035
- What's funny?
- Morpheus.

866
01:15:41,496 --> 01:15:43,207
He almost had me convinced.

867
01:15:43,457 --> 01:15:44,583
I know.

868
01:15:46,126 --> 01:15:48,253
Poor Morpheus.

869
01:15:50,631 --> 01:15:53,759
Without him, we're lost.

870
01:15:55,302 --> 01:15:57,471
What do you mean, "without him"?

871
01:16:01,475 --> 01:16:03,393
Are you sure you want
to hear this?

872
01:16:05,604 --> 01:16:08,357
Morpheus believes in you, Neo.

873
01:16:10,067 --> 01:16:12,236
And no one, not you, not even me...

874
01:16:12,486 --> 01:16:14,738
...can convince him otherwise.

875
01:16:15,113 --> 01:16:17,491
He believes it so blindly...

876
01:16:17,783 --> 01:16:22,120
...that he's going to sacrifice
his life to save yours.

877
01:16:22,329 --> 01:16:23,497
What?

878
01:16:23,664 --> 01:16:26,333
You're going to
have to make a choice.

879
01:16:26,959 --> 01:16:30,545
In the one hand,
you'll have Morpheus' life.

880
01:16:31,046 --> 01:16:33,924
And in the other hand,
you'll have your own.

881
01:16:35,342 --> 01:16:37,636
One of you is going to die.

882
01:16:39,721 --> 01:16:43,016
Which one will be up to you.

883
01:16:44,393 --> 01:16:46,311
I'm sorry, kiddo. I really am.

884
01:16:46,561 --> 01:16:48,230
You have a good soul.

885
01:16:49,314 --> 01:16:52,025
And I hate giving
good people bad news.

886
01:16:55,153 --> 01:16:56,613
Don't worry about it.

887
01:16:56,863 --> 01:16:59,283
As soon as you
step outside that door...

888
01:16:59,533 --> 01:17:01,660
...you'll start feeling better.

889
01:17:02,369 --> 01:17:06,164
You'll remember you don't believe
in any of this fate crap.

890
01:17:06,999 --> 01:17:09,751
You're in control of your own life.

891
01:17:10,585 --> 01:17:11,878
Remember?

892
01:17:13,547 --> 01:17:14,756
Here...

893
01:17:16,633 --> 01:17:18,176
...take a cookie.

894
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:22,055
I promise, by the time
you're done eating it...

895
01:17:23,015 --> 01:17:25,392
...you'll feel right as rain.

896
01:17:34,609 --> 01:17:35,944
What was said...

897
01:17:36,570 --> 01:17:38,030
...was for you...

898
01:17:38,572 --> 01:17:40,407
...and for you alone.

899
01:18:03,347 --> 01:18:04,431
They're on the way.

900
01:18:34,252 --> 01:18:35,295
What is that?

901
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:51,478
Oh, déjà vu.

902
01:18:54,981 --> 01:18:56,066
What did you just say?

903
01:18:56,316 --> 01:18:57,818
Nothing.
Just déjà vu.

904
01:18:58,068 --> 01:18:59,694
- What did you see?
- What happened?

905
01:19:01,113 --> 01:19:03,281
A black cat went past us...

906
01:19:03,532 --> 01:19:05,158
...then another just like it.

907
01:19:05,409 --> 01:19:06,952
Was it the same cat?

908
01:19:07,911 --> 01:19:10,747
- I'm not sure.
- Switch, Apoc.

909
01:19:14,835 --> 01:19:16,044
What is it?

910
01:19:16,294 --> 01:19:20,715
A déjà vu is usually a glitch in the
Matrix when they change something.

911
01:19:23,677 --> 01:19:24,928
Oh, my God.

912
01:19:26,721 --> 01:19:27,722
Let's go.

913
01:19:32,978 --> 01:19:34,771
They cut the hard line.
It's a trap! Get out!

914
01:19:40,235 --> 01:19:41,486
Oh, no.

915
01:20:21,776 --> 01:20:24,237
That's what they changed.
We're trapped.

916
01:20:24,488 --> 01:20:26,364
Be calm. Give me your phone.

917
01:20:26,615 --> 01:20:28,158
They'll be able to track it.

918
01:20:28,408 --> 01:20:29,826
We have no choice.

919
01:20:31,244 --> 01:20:32,454
Operator.

920
01:20:32,787 --> 01:20:35,624
<i>Find a structural drawing of
this building. Find it fast.</i>

921
01:20:43,465 --> 01:20:46,051
- Got it!
<i>- I need the main wet-wall.</i>

922
01:20:48,887 --> 01:20:50,138
Eighth floor.

923
01:20:50,347 --> 01:20:51,932
<i>They're on the eighth floor.</i>

924
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:53,683
Switch, straight ahead.

925
01:20:54,434 --> 01:20:55,602
Neo....

926
01:21:01,733 --> 01:21:03,860
I hope the Oracle
gave you some good news.

927
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:13,662
<i>Now left. That's it.</i>

928
01:21:13,954 --> 01:21:14,996
Good.

929
01:21:24,714 --> 01:21:26,007
Where are they?

930
01:22:26,443 --> 01:22:27,611
They're in the walls.

931
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:30,238
In the walls!

932
01:22:51,635 --> 01:22:53,303
It's an agent!

933
01:23:00,602 --> 01:23:01,936
Morpheus!

934
01:23:02,103 --> 01:23:03,355
You must get Neo out!

935
01:23:03,605 --> 01:23:05,440
He's all that matters!

936
01:23:05,732 --> 01:23:07,942
- No, Morpheus! Don't!
- Trinity, go!

937
01:23:08,902 --> 01:23:10,236
Go!

938
01:23:16,493 --> 01:23:18,411
- We can't leave him!
- We have to!

939
01:23:42,727 --> 01:23:44,521
Cypher, come on!

940
01:23:49,442 --> 01:23:53,279
The great Morpheus.
We meet at last.

941
01:23:53,822 --> 01:23:54,948
And you are?

942
01:23:55,198 --> 01:23:56,950
A Smith.

943
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:58,493
Agent Smith.

944
01:23:59,077 --> 01:24:01,121
You all look the same to me.

945
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:58,052
Take him.

946
01:25:04,684 --> 01:25:06,144
No!

947
01:25:11,274 --> 01:25:13,109
- Operator.
<i>- I need an exit, fast.</i>

948
01:25:15,195 --> 01:25:18,114
There was an accident.
Goddamn car accident.

949
01:25:18,448 --> 01:25:20,241
<i>All of a sudden, boom.</i>

950
01:25:20,492 --> 01:25:21,868
Somebody up there still likes me.

951
01:25:22,118 --> 01:25:23,369
I got you.

952
01:25:23,870 --> 01:25:25,789
<i>Just get me out of here fast.</i>

953
01:25:26,039 --> 01:25:28,708
Nearest exit, Franklin and Erie.
An old TV repair shop.

954
01:25:28,958 --> 01:25:30,001
Right.

955
01:25:33,129 --> 01:25:34,714
- Operator.
<i>- Tank, it's me.</i>

956
01:25:34,964 --> 01:25:36,132
Is Morpheus alive?

957
01:25:36,508 --> 01:25:37,801
Is Morpheus alive, Tank?

958
01:25:38,218 --> 01:25:40,136
<i>Yes. They're moving him.
I don't know where.</i>

959
01:25:40,345 --> 01:25:42,639
He's alive. We need an exit.

960
01:25:42,889 --> 01:25:43,973
You're not far from Cypher.

961
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:45,391
<i>- Cypher?</i>
- I know.

962
01:25:45,642 --> 01:25:47,727
<i>- I sent him to Franklin and Erie.</i>
- Got it.

963
01:25:56,820 --> 01:25:58,029
Got him.

964
01:26:08,957 --> 01:26:09,999
Where are they?

965
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:11,501
Making the call.

966
01:26:12,168 --> 01:26:13,336
Good.

967
01:26:26,474 --> 01:26:27,725
You first.

968
01:26:30,937 --> 01:26:32,146
Shit!

969
01:26:35,441 --> 01:26:37,110
Tank!

970
01:26:37,277 --> 01:26:38,903
No!

971
01:26:40,822 --> 01:26:42,991
I don't know. It just went dead.

972
01:27:09,809 --> 01:27:11,019
<i>Hello, Trinity.</i>

973
01:27:11,436 --> 01:27:12,770
Cypher? Where's Tank?

974
01:27:18,359 --> 01:27:19,402
You know...

975
01:27:21,112 --> 01:27:23,239
...for a long time...

976
01:27:24,449 --> 01:27:27,327
...I thought I was in love with you.

977
01:27:28,119 --> 01:27:30,163
<i>I used to dream about you.</i>

978
01:27:31,247 --> 01:27:33,958
You're a beautiful woman, Trinity.

979
01:27:34,208 --> 01:27:36,586
<i>Too bad things had to
turn out this way.</i>

980
01:27:37,128 --> 01:27:38,171
You killed them.

981
01:27:38,671 --> 01:27:40,173
- What?
- Oh, God.

982
01:27:40,423 --> 01:27:41,841
I'm tired, Trinity.

983
01:27:43,259 --> 01:27:45,136
I'm tired of this war...

984
01:27:45,428 --> 01:27:48,264
...tired of fighting.
I'm tired of this ship...

985
01:27:48,598 --> 01:27:53,227
...of being cold, of eating
the same goddamn goop every day.

986
01:27:55,438 --> 01:27:56,564
But most of all...

987
01:27:57,148 --> 01:28:00,526
<i>...I'm tired of that jackoff
and all of his bullshit.</i>

988
01:28:01,653 --> 01:28:02,946
Surprise, asshole!

989
01:28:03,488 --> 01:28:05,698
I bet you never saw this coming...

990
01:28:05,949 --> 01:28:06,991
...did you?

991
01:28:09,285 --> 01:28:11,663
God, I wish I could be there...

992
01:28:12,246 --> 01:28:13,748
...when they break you.

993
01:28:14,791 --> 01:28:17,961
I wish I could walk in
just when it happens...

994
01:28:18,670 --> 01:28:20,380
...so right then...

995
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:21,965
...you'd know it was me.

996
01:28:22,465 --> 01:28:23,633
You gave them Morpheus.

997
01:28:23,883 --> 01:28:25,343
<i>He lied to us, Trinity.</i>

998
01:28:25,927 --> 01:28:27,428
He tricked us!

999
01:28:27,971 --> 01:28:29,973
If you had told us the truth...

1000
01:28:30,223 --> 01:28:33,101
...we would've told you to shove
that red pill up your ass!

1001
01:28:33,351 --> 01:28:35,478
That is not true, Cypher.
He set us free.

1002
01:28:35,728 --> 01:28:38,606
"Free." You call this free?

1003
01:28:41,025 --> 01:28:43,528
All I do is what he tells me to do.

1004
01:28:45,113 --> 01:28:48,032
If I had to choose between
that and the Matrix...

1005
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:50,410
...I choose the Matrix.

1006
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:52,328
The Matrix isn't real.

1007
01:28:52,578 --> 01:28:53,997
<i>I disagree, Trinity.</i>

1008
01:28:54,247 --> 01:28:56,499
I think the Matrix...

1009
01:28:56,833 --> 01:28:59,419
...can be more real than this world.

1010
01:29:01,587 --> 01:29:04,090
All I do is pull the plug here.

1011
01:29:04,465 --> 01:29:05,675
But there...

1012
01:29:06,217 --> 01:29:08,511
<i>...you have to watch Apoc die.</i>

1013
01:29:09,512 --> 01:29:10,763
Trinity.

1014
01:29:16,269 --> 01:29:19,230
<i>- Welcome to the real world.</i>
- But you're out, Cypher.

1015
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:21,899
<i>- You can't go back.</i>
- That's what you think.

1016
01:29:22,150 --> 01:29:23,651
<i>They'll reinsert my body.</i>

1017
01:29:23,901 --> 01:29:27,530
<i>I go back to sleep. When I wake up,
I won't remember a thing.</i>

1018
01:29:27,739 --> 01:29:28,781
By the way...

1019
01:29:29,032 --> 01:29:31,993
...if you have anything important
to say to Switch...

1020
01:29:32,493 --> 01:29:33,578
<i>...say it now.</i>

1021
01:29:33,828 --> 01:29:36,873
- No, please don't.
- Not like this.

1022
01:29:38,583 --> 01:29:40,209
Not like this.

1023
01:29:44,672 --> 01:29:45,715
Too late.

1024
01:29:46,466 --> 01:29:47,759
Goddamn you, Cypher!

1025
01:29:48,009 --> 01:29:49,886
Don't hate me, Trinity.

1026
01:29:50,261 --> 01:29:52,138
I'm just a messenger.

1027
01:29:52,555 --> 01:29:55,725
And right now,
I'm going to prove it to you.

1028
01:29:56,809 --> 01:29:58,478
If Morpheus was right...

1029
01:29:59,020 --> 01:30:00,897
...there's no way
I can pull this plug.

1030
01:30:01,481 --> 01:30:02,982
<i>If Neo's the One...</i>

1031
01:30:03,483 --> 01:30:05,318
<i>...then there'd have to be...</i>

1032
01:30:05,568 --> 01:30:08,154
...some kind of a miracle to stop me.

1033
01:30:08,321 --> 01:30:09,530
Right?

1034
01:30:10,156 --> 01:30:12,241
I mean, how can he be the One...

1035
01:30:12,408 --> 01:30:13,493
...if he's dead?

1036
01:30:14,869 --> 01:30:17,121
<i>You never did answer me before...</i>

1037
01:30:17,413 --> 01:30:19,749
<i>...if you bought into
Morpheus' bullshit.</i>

1038
01:30:20,124 --> 01:30:23,336
Come on. All I want
is a little yes or no.

1039
01:30:24,712 --> 01:30:27,048
Look into his eyes...

1040
01:30:27,799 --> 01:30:29,300
<i>...those big, pretty eyes...</i>

1041
01:30:32,053 --> 01:30:33,387
...and tell me...

1042
01:30:34,097 --> 01:30:35,348
<i>...yes...</i>

1043
01:30:35,681 --> 01:30:37,058
<i>...or no.</i>

1044
01:30:38,351 --> 01:30:39,894
- Yes.
<i>- No!</i>

1045
01:30:40,061 --> 01:30:41,229
I don't believe it.

1046
01:30:42,647 --> 01:30:47,401
Believe it or not, you piece of shit,
you're still going to burn!

1047
01:31:05,670 --> 01:31:07,046
You first.

1048
01:31:15,263 --> 01:31:17,557
- You're hurt.
- I'll be all right.

1049
01:31:20,351 --> 01:31:21,519
Dozer?

1050
01:31:39,787 --> 01:31:42,165
Have you ever stood and stared at it?

1051
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:46,169
Marveled at its beauty...

1052
01:31:46,544 --> 01:31:48,796
...its genius?

1053
01:31:49,964 --> 01:31:51,841
Billions of people...

1054
01:31:52,091 --> 01:31:54,844
...just living out their lives.

1055
01:31:55,887 --> 01:31:57,555
Oblivious.

1056
01:32:02,143 --> 01:32:05,021
Did you know that the first Matrix...

1057
01:32:05,271 --> 01:32:09,942
...was designed to be a perfect
human world where none suffered...

1058
01:32:10,443 --> 01:32:13,362
...where everyone would be happy.

1059
01:32:13,905 --> 01:32:15,406
It was a disaster.

1060
01:32:15,656 --> 01:32:19,994
No one would accept the program.
Entire crops were lost.

1061
01:32:20,870 --> 01:32:22,622
Some believe that...

1062
01:32:22,872 --> 01:32:27,251
...we lacked the programming language
to describe your perfect world.

1063
01:32:27,501 --> 01:32:29,045
But I believe that...

1064
01:32:29,212 --> 01:32:30,379
...as a species...

1065
01:32:30,630 --> 01:32:34,467
...human beings define
their reality through misery...

1066
01:32:34,717 --> 01:32:36,093
...and suffering.

1067
01:32:36,344 --> 01:32:39,055
So the perfect world was a dream...

1068
01:32:39,305 --> 01:32:44,143
...that your primitive cerebrum
kept trying to wake up from.

1069
01:32:45,478 --> 01:32:49,148
Which is why the Matrix was
redesigned to this.

1070
01:32:49,607 --> 01:32:51,108
The peak...

1071
01:32:51,359 --> 01:32:52,777
...of your civilization.

1072
01:32:53,027 --> 01:32:55,279
I say, "your civilization"...

1073
01:32:55,529 --> 01:32:59,659
...because when we started thinking
for you, it became our civilization...

1074
01:32:59,909 --> 01:33:02,995
...which is, of course,
what this is all about.

1075
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:06,916
Evolution, Morpheus.

1076
01:33:07,208 --> 01:33:08,542
Evolution.

1077
01:33:10,836 --> 01:33:12,713
Like the dinosaur.

1078
01:33:14,882 --> 01:33:16,509
Look out that window.

1079
01:33:17,218 --> 01:33:19,345
You had your time.

1080
01:33:20,054 --> 01:33:23,975
The future is our world, Morpheus.

1081
01:33:24,308 --> 01:33:26,686
The future is our time.

1082
01:33:30,940 --> 01:33:32,108
There could be a problem.

1083
01:33:33,025 --> 01:33:36,404
- What are they doing to him?
- They're breaking into his mind.

1084
01:33:36,654 --> 01:33:38,823
It's like hacking a computer.
All it takes is time.

1085
01:33:39,073 --> 01:33:40,283
How much time?

1086
01:33:40,533 --> 01:33:43,661
Depends on the mind.
But eventually, it'll crack...

1087
01:33:43,911 --> 01:33:48,332
...and his alpha patterns
will change from this to this.

1088
01:33:48,582 --> 01:33:51,544
When it does, he'll tell them
anything they want to know.

1089
01:33:51,794 --> 01:33:52,837
What do they want?

1090
01:33:53,087 --> 01:33:57,133
The leader of every ship is given
codes to Zion's mainframe computer.

1091
01:33:57,383 --> 01:34:00,303
If an agent got the codes
and got into Zion's mainframe...

1092
01:34:00,553 --> 01:34:03,639
...they could destroy us.
We can't let that happen.

1093
01:34:03,806 --> 01:34:06,058
Trinity, Zion's more important than me...

1094
01:34:06,225 --> 01:34:07,393
...or you...

1095
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:08,853
...or even Morpheus.

1096
01:34:12,648 --> 01:34:14,317
There has to be
something we can do.

1097
01:34:14,734 --> 01:34:16,736
There is. We pull the plug.

1098
01:34:19,822 --> 01:34:21,574
You're going to kill him?

1099
01:34:21,824 --> 01:34:22,992
Kill Morpheus?

1100
01:34:23,617 --> 01:34:25,244
We don't have a choice.

1101
01:34:32,043 --> 01:34:34,962
Never send a human
to do a machine's job.

1102
01:34:35,212 --> 01:34:36,964
If the insider has failed...

1103
01:34:37,214 --> 01:34:40,426
...they'll sever the connection
as soon as possible, unless--

1104
01:34:40,676 --> 01:34:42,386
They're dead. In either case--

1105
01:34:42,636 --> 01:34:46,182
We have no choice. Continue as planned.
Deploy the sentinels.

1106
01:34:46,432 --> 01:34:47,516
Immediately.

1107
01:34:52,772 --> 01:34:55,441
Morpheus, you were more
than a leader to us.

1108
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:58,611
You were a father.

1109
01:35:00,154 --> 01:35:02,114
We'll miss you always.

1110
01:35:08,996 --> 01:35:10,206
Stop!

1111
01:35:11,374 --> 01:35:12,708
I don't believe this is happening.

1112
01:35:12,875 --> 01:35:14,919
- Neo, this has to be done.
- Does it?

1113
01:35:15,711 --> 01:35:17,088
I don't know.

1114
01:35:17,421 --> 01:35:19,882
- This can't be just coincidence.
- What?

1115
01:35:20,091 --> 01:35:21,342
The Oracle.

1116
01:35:21,592 --> 01:35:23,386
She told me this would happen.

1117
01:35:23,803 --> 01:35:27,973
She told me that I would
have to make a choice.

1118
01:35:28,432 --> 01:35:29,642
What choice?

1119
01:35:32,645 --> 01:35:35,147
- What are you doing?
- I'm going in.

1120
01:35:35,481 --> 01:35:37,817
- No, you're not.
- I have to.

1121
01:35:38,025 --> 01:35:41,654
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself
so that we could get you out.

1122
01:35:41,904 --> 01:35:43,823
There is no way
that you're going back in.

1123
01:35:44,407 --> 01:35:47,660
Morpheus did what he did because
he believed I'm something I'm not.

1124
01:35:49,161 --> 01:35:50,204
What?

1125
01:35:50,913 --> 01:35:52,540
I'm not the One, Trinity.

1126
01:35:52,915 --> 01:35:55,876
- The Oracle hit me with that too.
- No, you have to be.

1127
01:35:56,127 --> 01:35:58,796
I'm sorry, I'm not.
I'm just another guy.

1128
01:35:59,463 --> 01:36:00,714
No, Neo, that's not true.

1129
01:36:01,298 --> 01:36:03,926
- It can't be true.
- Why?

1130
01:36:08,347 --> 01:36:11,684
This is loco. They've got Morpheus
in a military-controlled building.

1131
01:36:11,934 --> 01:36:16,313
Even if you somehow got inside, those
are agents holding him. Three of them.

1132
01:36:17,606 --> 01:36:21,527
I want Morpheus back too, but
what you're talking about is suicide.

1133
01:36:21,777 --> 01:36:23,362
That's what it looks like...

1134
01:36:23,529 --> 01:36:24,572
...but it's not.

1135
01:36:24,822 --> 01:36:27,199
I can't explain to you why it's not.

1136
01:36:28,284 --> 01:36:31,996
Morpheus believed something, and
he was ready to give his life for it.

1137
01:36:32,246 --> 01:36:35,249
I understand that now.
That's why I have to go.

1138
01:36:35,541 --> 01:36:38,043
- Why?
- Because I believe in something.

1139
01:36:38,210 --> 01:36:39,837
What?

1140
01:36:40,546 --> 01:36:42,256
I believe I can bring him back.

1141
01:36:59,231 --> 01:37:01,150
- What are you doing?
- Going with you.

1142
01:37:01,442 --> 01:37:03,444
- No, you're not.
- "No"?

1143
01:37:04,612 --> 01:37:06,739
Let me tell you what I believe.

1144
01:37:07,239 --> 01:37:09,617
Morpheus means more to me
than he does to you.

1145
01:37:09,950 --> 01:37:14,246
I believe if you are serious about
saving him, you will need my help.

1146
01:37:14,497 --> 01:37:16,540
And since I am the ranking officer...

1147
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:19,668
...if you don't like it,
I believe you can go to hell.

1148
01:37:20,419 --> 01:37:22,838
Because you aren't going anywhere else.

1149
01:37:23,255 --> 01:37:24,798
Tank...

1150
01:37:24,965 --> 01:37:26,091
...load us up.

1151
01:37:35,726 --> 01:37:39,021
I'd like to share
a revelation that I've had...

1152
01:37:39,438 --> 01:37:40,981
...during my time here.

1153
01:37:41,232 --> 01:37:45,236
It came to me when I tried
to classify your species...

1154
01:37:45,486 --> 01:37:47,738
...and I realized...

1155
01:37:47,988 --> 01:37:50,282
...that you're not actually mammals.

1156
01:37:52,493 --> 01:37:54,954
Every mammal on this planet...

1157
01:37:55,287 --> 01:38:00,209
...instinctively develops an equilibrium
with the surrounding environment.

1158
01:38:00,459 --> 01:38:02,294
But you humans do not.

1159
01:38:02,836 --> 01:38:06,382
You move to an area
and you multiply...

1160
01:38:06,632 --> 01:38:11,136
...and multiply until every
natural resource is consumed.

1161
01:38:11,470 --> 01:38:13,556
The only way you can survive...

1162
01:38:13,847 --> 01:38:16,809
...is to spread to another area.

1163
01:38:22,231 --> 01:38:25,109
There is another organism
on this planet...

1164
01:38:25,359 --> 01:38:27,319
...that follows the same pattern.

1165
01:38:27,945 --> 01:38:29,613
Do you know what it is?

1166
01:38:29,989 --> 01:38:31,824
A virus.

1167
01:38:33,158 --> 01:38:36,203
Human beings are a disease.

1168
01:38:36,579 --> 01:38:38,122
A cancer of this planet.

1169
01:38:38,372 --> 01:38:40,499
You are a plague.

1170
01:38:41,041 --> 01:38:42,459
And we...

1171
01:38:42,626 --> 01:38:44,003
...are the cure.

1172
01:38:45,004 --> 01:38:46,422
Okay, so what do you need?

1173
01:38:47,047 --> 01:38:48,173
Besides a miracle.

1174
01:38:48,757 --> 01:38:49,967
Guns.

1175
01:38:50,801 --> 01:38:52,011
Lots of guns.

1176
01:39:01,895 --> 01:39:03,105
Neo....

1177
01:39:04,857 --> 01:39:07,401
No one has ever done
anything like this.

1178
01:39:08,611 --> 01:39:10,529
That's why it's going to work.

1179
01:39:14,617 --> 01:39:16,535
Why isn't the serum working?

1180
01:39:17,161 --> 01:39:19,455
Perhaps we're asking
the wrong questions.

1181
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:22,791
Leave me with him.

1182
01:39:25,377 --> 01:39:26,503
Now.

1183
01:39:37,723 --> 01:39:39,308
Hold on, Morpheus.

1184
01:39:39,558 --> 01:39:42,269
They're coming for you.
They're coming.

1185
01:39:44,647 --> 01:39:46,774
Can you hear me, Morpheus?

1186
01:39:47,024 --> 01:39:49,693
I'm going to be honest...

1187
01:39:50,069 --> 01:39:51,278
...with you.

1188
01:39:55,658 --> 01:39:57,076
I...

1189
01:39:57,951 --> 01:39:59,078
...hate...

1190
01:39:59,328 --> 01:40:01,288
...this place...

1191
01:40:01,622 --> 01:40:03,916
...this zoo...

1192
01:40:04,166 --> 01:40:05,292
...this prison...

1193
01:40:05,542 --> 01:40:08,712
...this reality,
whatever you want to call it.

1194
01:40:08,962 --> 01:40:11,256
I can't stand it any longer.

1195
01:40:12,007 --> 01:40:13,884
It's the smell.

1196
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:17,137
If there is such a thing.

1197
01:40:17,471 --> 01:40:20,766
I feel saturated by it.

1198
01:40:22,267 --> 01:40:23,560
I can...

1199
01:40:23,811 --> 01:40:25,354
...taste...

1200
01:40:25,521 --> 01:40:27,564
...your stink.

1201
01:40:27,815 --> 01:40:31,443
And every time I do, I fear that
I have somehow been infected by it.

1202
01:40:31,610 --> 01:40:32,611
It's repulsive.

1203
01:40:33,612 --> 01:40:34,988
Isn't it?

1204
01:40:37,157 --> 01:40:39,451
I must get out of here.

1205
01:40:39,868 --> 01:40:42,079
I must get free.

1206
01:40:42,329 --> 01:40:45,207
And in this mind is the key.

1207
01:40:45,457 --> 01:40:47,126
My key.

1208
01:40:47,376 --> 01:40:50,254
Once Zion is destroyed,
there is no need for me to be here.

1209
01:40:50,504 --> 01:40:52,131
Do you understand?

1210
01:40:52,423 --> 01:40:53,799
I need the codes.

1211
01:40:54,049 --> 01:40:56,385
I have to get inside Zion...

1212
01:40:56,719 --> 01:40:59,221
...and you have to tell me how.

1213
01:40:59,638 --> 01:41:01,515
You're going to tell me...

1214
01:41:01,765 --> 01:41:03,934
...or you're going to die.

1215
01:41:24,121 --> 01:41:27,249
Please remove any metallic items
you're carrying. Keys, loose change.

1216
01:41:31,170 --> 01:41:32,212
Holy shit!

1217
01:41:44,308 --> 01:41:47,019
Backup. Send backup.

1218
01:42:10,834 --> 01:42:11,960
Freeze!

1219
01:44:26,803 --> 01:44:28,013
What were you doing?

1220
01:44:29,848 --> 01:44:31,141
He doesn't know.

1221
01:44:31,391 --> 01:44:32,893
Know what?

1222
01:45:00,963 --> 01:45:03,465
I think they're trying to save him.

1223
01:45:18,313 --> 01:45:20,065
There is no spoon.

1224
01:45:49,678 --> 01:45:51,847
Find them and destroy them!

1225
01:45:53,473 --> 01:45:55,308
We're under attack!

1226
01:46:27,424 --> 01:46:28,592
Trinity!

1227
01:46:29,092 --> 01:46:30,177
Help!

1228
01:46:52,199 --> 01:46:53,408
Only human.

1229
01:46:54,367 --> 01:46:55,452
Dodge this.

1230
01:47:08,673 --> 01:47:10,175
- How did you do that?
- Do what?

1231
01:47:10,592 --> 01:47:14,513
You moved like they do.
I've never seen anyone move that fast.

1232
01:47:15,639 --> 01:47:17,015
It wasn't fast enough.

1233
01:47:19,768 --> 01:47:21,061
Can you fly that thing?

1234
01:47:22,187 --> 01:47:23,188
Not yet.

1235
01:47:26,483 --> 01:47:27,526
Operator.

1236
01:47:27,734 --> 01:47:30,904
<i>I need a pilot program
for a B-212 helicopter.</i>

1237
01:47:31,363 --> 01:47:32,656
<i>Hurry.</i>

1238
01:47:40,580 --> 01:47:42,207
Let's go.

1239
01:47:57,305 --> 01:47:58,390
No.

1240
01:48:49,983 --> 01:48:52,611
Morpheus, get up.
Get up, get up.

1241
01:49:30,649 --> 01:49:31,691
He's not going to make it.

1242
01:49:41,493 --> 01:49:42,535
Got you.

1243
01:50:48,601 --> 01:50:49,769
Trinity!

1244
01:51:31,436 --> 01:51:32,854
I knew it.

1245
01:51:33,480 --> 01:51:34,689
He's the One.

1246
01:51:50,663 --> 01:51:52,874
Do you believe it now, Trinity?

1247
01:51:55,752 --> 01:51:56,920
Morpheus....

1248
01:51:58,588 --> 01:51:59,672
The Oracle.

1249
01:52:00,924 --> 01:52:03,301
- She told me--
- She told you...

1250
01:52:03,676 --> 01:52:05,261
...what you needed to hear.

1251
01:52:05,553 --> 01:52:06,888
That's all.

1252
01:52:07,931 --> 01:52:10,892
Sooner or later you'll realize,
just as I did...

1253
01:52:11,226 --> 01:52:13,520
...there's a difference
between knowing the path...

1254
01:52:14,270 --> 01:52:15,563
...and walking the path.

1255
01:52:18,608 --> 01:52:19,818
- Operator.
<i>- Tank.</i>

1256
01:52:20,735 --> 01:52:23,279
- It's good to hear your voice.
<i>- We need an exit.</i>

1257
01:52:23,530 --> 01:52:26,324
Got one ready. Subway station,
State and Balboa.

1258
01:52:39,379 --> 01:52:41,798
- Damn it!
- The trace was completed.

1259
01:52:42,048 --> 01:52:45,635
- We have their position.
- Sentinels are standing by.

1260
01:52:47,345 --> 01:52:48,847
Order the strike.

1261
01:52:55,395 --> 01:52:57,397
They're not out yet.

1262
01:53:08,575 --> 01:53:09,909
You first, Morpheus.

1263
01:53:30,597 --> 01:53:32,891
Neo, I want to tell you something...

1264
01:53:36,144 --> 01:53:40,106
...but I'm afraid of
what it could mean if I do.

1265
01:53:43,693 --> 01:53:46,988
Everything the Oracle
told me has come true.

1266
01:53:49,741 --> 01:53:51,284
Everything but this.

1267
01:53:52,785 --> 01:53:53,828
But what?

1268
01:54:18,728 --> 01:54:19,896
Neo!

1269
01:54:20,146 --> 01:54:21,773
- What happened?
- An agent.

1270
01:54:22,023 --> 01:54:23,942
- Send me back.
- I can't.

1271
01:54:25,985 --> 01:54:27,946
Mr. Anderson.

1272
01:54:30,156 --> 01:54:31,533
Run, Neo. Run.

1273
01:54:36,829 --> 01:54:38,456
What is he doing?

1274
01:54:38,706 --> 01:54:39,958
He's beginning to believe.

1275
01:55:06,943 --> 01:55:08,319
You're empty.

1276
01:55:08,903 --> 01:55:10,196
So are you.

1277
01:55:43,354 --> 01:55:46,357
I'm going to enjoy watching you die...

1278
01:55:47,483 --> 01:55:48,526
...Mr. Anderson.

1279
01:56:29,484 --> 01:56:31,569
Jesus, he's killing him.

1280
01:57:57,739 --> 01:57:59,866
You hear that, Mr. Anderson?

1281
01:58:00,616 --> 01:58:03,619
That is the sound of inevitability.

1282
01:58:06,205 --> 01:58:09,542
It is the sound of your death.

1283
01:58:10,460 --> 01:58:12,795
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

1284
01:58:13,045 --> 01:58:14,672
My name...

1285
01:58:17,675 --> 01:58:19,719
...is Neo.

1286
01:58:51,959 --> 01:58:54,170
- What happened?
- I don't know. I lost him.

1287
01:58:56,672 --> 01:58:57,715
Oh, shit.

1288
01:59:10,102 --> 01:59:11,562
Sentinels.

1289
01:59:12,313 --> 01:59:14,565
- How long?
- Five, maybe six minutes.

1290
01:59:16,609 --> 01:59:18,778
Tank, charge the EMP.

1291
01:59:19,028 --> 01:59:22,073
- We can't use that until he's out.
- I know. Don't worry.

1292
01:59:23,241 --> 01:59:24,325
He's gonna make it.

1293
01:59:24,575 --> 01:59:26,452
Flat or pumps? No, just--

1294
01:59:26,702 --> 01:59:29,580
What the shit? That's my phone!

1295
01:59:29,997 --> 01:59:31,582
That guy took my phone!

1296
01:59:33,960 --> 01:59:36,254
Got him!
He's on the run.

1297
01:59:36,504 --> 01:59:39,173
Mr. Wizard, get me out of here!

1298
01:59:39,423 --> 01:59:41,300
<i>I got an old exit.
Wabash and Lake.</i>

1299
01:59:45,263 --> 01:59:46,264
Oh, shit!

1300
02:00:07,827 --> 02:00:09,829
Help! Need a little help!

1301
02:00:11,455 --> 02:00:12,665
<i>The door.</i>

1302
02:00:28,639 --> 02:00:30,141
<i>The door on your left.</i>

1303
02:00:31,058 --> 02:00:32,310
<i>Your other left!</i>

1304
02:00:39,025 --> 02:00:40,276
<i>The back door.</i>

1305
02:01:01,047 --> 02:01:02,173
Oh, no.

1306
02:01:03,841 --> 02:01:05,343
Here they come.

1307
02:01:34,121 --> 02:01:35,373
He's going to make it.

1308
02:01:45,591 --> 02:01:48,719
<i>The fire escape at the end
of the alley, room 303.</i>

1309
02:02:23,838 --> 02:02:24,922
They're inside.

1310
02:02:27,258 --> 02:02:28,300
Hurry, Neo.

1311
02:03:24,523 --> 02:03:25,649
It can't be.

1312
02:03:33,449 --> 02:03:34,825
Check him.

1313
02:03:38,829 --> 02:03:40,372
He's gone.

1314
02:03:47,088 --> 02:03:49,507
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

1315
02:03:57,098 --> 02:03:58,140
Neo....

1316
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:01,560
I'm not afraid anymore.

1317
02:04:03,187 --> 02:04:04,522
The Oracle told me...

1318
02:04:04,688 --> 02:04:10,111
...I'd fall in love, and that
the man I loved would be the One.

1319
02:04:13,239 --> 02:04:15,199
So you see...

1320
02:04:15,908 --> 02:04:17,910
...you can't be dead.

1321
02:04:19,495 --> 02:04:21,330
You can't be...

1322
02:04:22,873 --> 02:04:25,042
...because I love you.

1323
02:04:26,877 --> 02:04:28,587
You hear me?

1324
02:04:29,713 --> 02:04:31,382
I love you.

1325
02:04:55,114 --> 02:04:56,407
Now, get up.

1326
02:05:05,082 --> 02:05:06,250
No.

1327
02:05:32,985 --> 02:05:34,028
How?

1328
02:05:34,904 --> 02:05:35,946
He is the One.

1329
02:07:02,700 --> 02:07:04,159
Neo!

1330
02:08:00,424 --> 02:08:02,134
<i>I know you're out there.</i>

1331
02:08:02,384 --> 02:08:04,219
<i>I can feel you now.</i>

1332
02:08:04,636 --> 02:08:08,265
<i>I know that you're afraid.
You're afraid of us.</i>

1333
02:08:08,599 --> 02:08:10,434
<i>You're afraid of change.</i>

1334
02:08:11,894 --> 02:08:13,228
<i>I don't know the future.</i>

1335
02:08:13,395 --> 02:08:15,981
<i>I didn't come here to tell you
how this is going to end.</i>

1336
02:08:16,231 --> 02:08:19,193
<i>I came here to tell you
how it's going to begin.</i>

1337
02:08:20,152 --> 02:08:21,737
<i>I'll hang up this phone.</i>

1338
02:08:21,987 --> 02:08:25,074
<i>And then I'll show these people
what you don't want them to see.</i>

1339
02:08:25,324 --> 02:08:27,201
<i>I'm going to show them a world...</i>

1340
02:08:27,451 --> 02:08:29,203
<i>...without you.</i>

1341
02:08:29,495 --> 02:08:33,123
<i>A world without rules and controls,
without borders or boundaries.</i>

1342
02:08:33,374 --> 02:08:37,086
<i>A world where anything is possible.</i>

1343
02:08:39,713 --> 02:08:41,048
<i>Where we go from there...</i>

1344
02:08:41,298 --> 02:08:43,258
<i>...is a choice I leave to you.</i>
