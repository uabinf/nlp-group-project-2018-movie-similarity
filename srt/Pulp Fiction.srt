I'm through doing that shit.

00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,744
You always say that.
The same thing every time.

3

too dangerous."

I know that's what I always say.
I'm always right too.

5

You forget about it in a day or two.
The days of me forgetting are over.

6
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,964
The days of me remembering
have just begun.

7
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,249
You know, when you go on like this,
what you sound like?

8
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:53,261
I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.
You sound like a duck.

9
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,847
Quack, quack, quack. Take heart, 'cause
you're never gonna have to hear it again.

10
00:00:56,932 --> 00:01:00,351
Since I'm never gonna do it again, you're
never gonna have to hear me quack.

11
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:05,147
After tonight? Correct. I
got all tonight to quack.

Oh, yes!

Thank you.
You're welcome.

14
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:15,658
I mean, the way it is now,

15
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,536
you're takin' the same risk
as when you rob a bank.

16
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,663
Takin' more of a risk.
Banks are easier.

17
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,749
Federal banks ain't supposed to stop
you in any way during a robbery.

18
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:28,045
They're insured. Why should they give a fuck?
I don't even need a gun in a federal bank.

19
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,591
Heard about this one bloke, he walks
into a bank with a portable phone.

20
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:34,635
He gives the phone to a teller.
The bloke on the other end says,

21
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,280
"We got this guy's little girl. If you don't
give him all your money, we're gonna kill her."

22
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,188
- Did it work?
- Fuckin' right it worked. That's what I'm talkin' about.

23
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:47,023

not a pistol, not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone.

24
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:51,736
Cleans the place out. They don't lift a fuckin' finger.
Did they hurt the little girl?

25
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,531
There probably never was a little girl.
The point of the story isn't a little girl.

26
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,576
The point of the story is they
robbed a bank with a telephone.

27
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,621
- You want to rob banks?
- I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.

28

easier than what we've been doing.

- No more liquor stores?
- What've we been talkin' about? Yeah, no more liquor stores.

30
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,422
Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be.
There's too many foreigners own liquor stores.

31

Vietnamese, Koreans,
don't even speak fuckin' English.

32

You tell 'em empty out the register, they
don't know what you're talkin' about.

33
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,803
They make it too personal.

34

We keep on, one of these gook fuckers gonna
make us kill him. I'm not gonna kill anybody.

35
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:26,520
I don't want to either. But they'll probably
put us in a situation where it's us or them.

36
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,522
And if it's not the gooks,

37
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:31,233
it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned
the store for 15 fucking generations.

Why not?

blown off stickin' up one of them.

you catch with their pants down.

52
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,494
They're not expectin' to get robbed.
Not as expectin' anyway.

53

I bet you could cut down on the hero
factor in a place like this. Correct.

- Thank you.
- Made more from the wallets than we did from the register.

Yes, we did. A lot of

- Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.

- He fell out of a window.
- Hmm. Hmm.

to say it would be that he was thrown out.

Another way would be
he was thrown out by Marsellus.

out of a window by Marsellus because of you.

No.

about ever leaving that island alive,

966
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:33,947
so three days before
the Japanese took the island,

967
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:39,244
your granddad asked a gunner on an
Air Force transport, name of Winocki...

968
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:42,247
a man he'd never met before
in his life...

969

his gold watch.

he paid a visit to your grandmother,

his dad's gold watch.

He was captured, put in
a Vietnamese prison camp.

He knew if the gooks
ever saw the watch,

978
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:27,543
it'd be confiscated,
taken away.

979
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:31,338
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.

980
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:35,342

greasy, yellow hands on his boy's birthright,

981

he could hide something-his ass.

Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I
smelled some coffee back there.

1766
02:03:26,649 --> 02:03:30,110
Would you make me a cup?
Uh, yeah, sure.

1767
02:03:31,571 --> 02:03:34,489
Oh, uh, um, how do you take it?

1768
02:03:34,574 --> 02:03:37,117
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

1769
02:03:39,203 --> 02:03:42,623
About the car, is there anything
I need to know? Does it stall?

1770
02:03:42,707 --> 02:03:46,084
Does it smoke? Does it make a lot of noise?
Is there gas in it?

1771
02:03:46,210 --> 02:03:49,630
Aside from how it looks, the car's cool.
Positive?

1772
02:03:49,714 --> 02:03:53,091
Don't get me on the road and I find
out the brake lights don't work.

1773
02:03:53,217 --> 02:03:57,262
As far as I know, the motherfucker's
tip-top. Good enough.

1774
02:03:57,347 --> 02:03:59,348
Let's go back to the kitchen.

1775
02:04:02,518 --> 02:04:04,895
[EXHALES]

1776
02:04:05,021 --> 02:04:07,981
Here you go, Mr. Wolf.
Thank you, Jimmie.

1777
02:04:12,820 --> 02:04:14,738
Mmm.

1778
02:04:15,823 --> 02:04:17,908
Okay, first thing.
You two.

1779
02:04:17,992 --> 02:04:20,911
Take the body,
stick it in the trunk.

1780
02:04:20,995 --> 02:04:23,664
This looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

1781
02:04:23,790 --> 02:04:27,751
That would lead me to believe you got
cleansers and shit. Yeah. Under the sink.

1782
02:04:27,835 --> 02:04:31,254
Good. What I need you two fellas to
do is take those cleaning products...

1783
02:04:31,339 --> 02:04:35,342
and clean the inside of the car-
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.

1784
02:04:35,426 --> 02:04:39,346
Go in the back seat, scoop up all those
little pieces of brain and skull.

1785
02:04:39,430 --> 02:04:42,349
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.

1786
02:04:42,433 --> 02:04:45,352
It don't need to be spick-and-span.
You don't need to eat off it.

1787
02:04:45,436 --> 02:04:49,773
Just give it a good once-over. What you need
to take care of are the really messy parts.

1788
02:04:49,857 --> 02:04:53,944
The pools of blood that have collected,
you gotta soak that shit up.

1789
02:04:54,028 --> 02:04:56,446
We need to raid
your linen closet.

1790
02:04:56,531 --> 02:04:59,449
I need blankets, I need
comforters, quilts, bedspreads.

1791
02:04:59,534 --> 02:05:03,161
The thicker the better, the darker the better.
No whites. Can't use 'em.

1792
02:05:03,246 --> 02:05:08,542
We'll need to camouflage the front
seat and back seat and floorboards...

1793
02:05:08,626 --> 02:05:10,544
with quilts and blankets,

1794
02:05:10,628 --> 02:05:14,548
so if a cop starts stickin' his big snout
in the car, the subterfuge won't last,

1795
02:05:14,632 --> 02:05:17,467
but at a glance the car
will appear to be normal.

1796
02:05:17,552 --> 02:05:19,594
Jimmie, lead the way.
Boys, get to work.

1797
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:21,430
"Please" would be nice.

1798
02:05:22,890 --> 02:05:25,892
- Come again?
- I said, a "please" would be nice.

1799
02:05:27,729 --> 02:05:31,606
Get it straight, Buster. I'm not here to say please.
I'm here to tell you what to do.

1800
02:05:33,401 --> 02:05:36,319
And if self-preservation
is an instinct you possess,

1801
02:05:36,404 --> 02:05:38,822
you'd better fuckin' do it
and do it quick.

1802
02:05:38,906 --> 02:05:42,784
I'm here to help. If my help's not
appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.

1803
02:05:42,869 --> 02:05:46,163
No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that;
your help is definitely appreciated.

1804
02:05:46,247 --> 02:05:49,166
Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't mean
disrespect, okay? I respect you.

1805
02:05:49,250 --> 02:05:52,085
I just don't like people
barkin' orders at me.

1806
02:05:52,170 --> 02:05:55,172
If I'm curt with you,
it's because time is a factor.

1807
02:05:55,256 --> 02:05:59,885
I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys
to act fast if you wanna get out of this.

1808
02:05:59,969 --> 02:06:03,430
So pretty please, with sugar
on top, clean the fuckin' car.

1809
02:06:07,935 --> 02:06:11,605
Don't be lookin' at me like that, all right?
I can feel your look.

1810
02:06:14,317 --> 02:06:16,985
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

1811
02:06:17,070 --> 02:06:18,987
[SIPPING]

1812
02:06:19,072 --> 02:06:20,989
Green.

1813
02:06:22,617 --> 02:06:25,535
Nothin' except for
the mess inside.

1814
02:06:27,747 --> 02:06:30,165
Mmm, about 20 minutes.

1815
02:06:31,667 --> 02:06:33,627
Nobody who'll be missed.

1816
02:06:35,671 --> 02:06:38,632
You're a good man, Joe.
Thanks a bunch.

1817
02:06:39,717 --> 02:06:41,635
How we comin', Jimmie?
Pretty good.

1818
02:06:41,719 --> 02:06:44,846
I got it all here, but, uh,
[SIGHS]

1819
02:06:44,972 --> 02:06:48,391
Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand something.
Winston, Jimmie, Winston.

1820
02:06:48,476 --> 02:06:51,978
Okay. You gotta understand
something, uh, Winston.

1821
02:06:52,063 --> 02:06:53,980
Uh-Uh, no, thank you.

1822
02:06:54,065 --> 02:06:57,192
Uh, this is our
best linen here,

1823
02:06:57,276 --> 02:07:00,195
and it's, uh-
it was a wedding present...

1824
02:07:00,279 --> 02:07:02,656
from my Uncle Conrad
and my Aunt Ginny.

1825
02:07:02,782 --> 02:07:07,202
They're not with us anymore. I wanna
help-Let me ask you a question.

1826
02:07:07,286 --> 02:07:10,205
If you don't mind. No, no, please.
Go ahead.

1827
02:07:11,791 --> 02:07:16,670
Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt
ginny, were they millionaires?

1828
02:07:17,839 --> 02:07:19,756
No.

1829
02:07:19,841 --> 02:07:22,259
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.

1830
02:07:22,343 --> 02:07:25,720
And I'm positive that if
Uncle Conrad and Aunt...

1831
02:07:25,847 --> 02:07:28,265
Ginny.
Ginny were here,

1832
02:07:28,349 --> 02:07:32,602
they would furnish you
with a whole bedroom set,

1833
02:07:32,687 --> 02:07:35,856
which your Uncle Marsellus
is more than happy to do.

1834
02:07:39,819 --> 02:07:43,738
I like oak myself.
That's what I have in my bedroom.

1835
02:07:44,866 --> 02:07:46,825
How about you, Jimmie?

1836
02:07:48,035 --> 02:07:49,995
You an oak man?

1837
02:07:51,080 --> 02:07:53,039
Oak's nice.

1838
02:07:58,880 --> 02:08:02,716
Oh, man, I will never forgive
your ass for this shit.

1839
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:05,218
This is some fucked-up,
repugnant shit.

1840
02:08:05,303 --> 02:08:08,722
Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy
that once a man admits that he is wrong,

1841
02:08:08,806 --> 02:08:11,725
that he is immediately forgiven
for all wrongdoings?

1842
02:08:11,809 --> 02:08:14,728
Get the fuck out my face
with that shit!

1843
02:08:14,812 --> 02:08:17,606
The motherfucker that said that shit never
had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull...

1844
02:08:17,732 --> 02:08:21,484
on account of your dumb ass. I got a threshold,
Jules, for the abuse that I will take.

1845
02:08:21,569 --> 02:08:25,155
Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car,
and you got me in the red.

1846
02:08:25,239 --> 02:08:28,658
I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous
to have a race car in the fuckin' red.

1847
02:08:28,743 --> 02:08:30,619
That's all. I could blow.

1848
02:08:30,745 --> 02:08:32,662
Oh, you ready to blow?
Yeah.

1849
02:08:32,747 --> 02:08:35,665
Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin'
motherfucker, motherfucker.

1850
02:08:35,750 --> 02:08:38,668
Every time my fingers touch brain,
I'm Superfly T.N.T.

1851
02:08:38,753 --> 02:08:40,670
I'm the Guns of the Navarone.

1852
02:08:40,755 --> 02:08:43,673
In fact, what the fuck
am I doin' in the back?

1853
02:08:43,758 --> 02:08:47,010
You're the motherfucker should be on brain detail!
We're fuckin' switchin'!

1854
02:08:47,094 --> 02:08:49,554
I'm washin' windows, you're
pickin' up this nigger's skull!

1855
02:08:59,273 --> 02:09:01,233
Fine job, gentlemen.

1856
02:09:02,568 --> 02:09:04,986
You may get out of this yet.

1857
02:09:05,071 --> 02:09:07,489
I can't believe
this is the same car.

1858
02:09:07,573 --> 02:09:10,992
Well, let's not start suckin'
each other's dicks quite yet.

1859
02:09:11,077 --> 02:09:14,496
Phase one is complete-clean the car-which
moves us right along to phase two:

1860
02:09:14,580 --> 02:09:16,498
clean you two.

1861
02:09:18,084 --> 02:09:19,918
Strip.

1862
02:09:20,044 --> 02:09:23,797
All the way? [WOLF]
To your bare ass.

1863
02:09:23,881 --> 02:09:26,925
Quickly, gentlemen.
We got about 15 minutes...

1864
02:09:27,009 --> 02:09:29,928
before Jimmie's better half
comes pulling into the driveway.

1865
02:09:30,012 --> 02:09:32,514
Goddamn, this morning air
is some chilly shit.

1866
02:09:32,598 --> 02:09:34,516
Are you sure this is
absolutely necessary?

1867
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:37,018
You know what you two look like?
[VINCENT] What?

1868
02:09:37,103 --> 02:09:40,522
Like a couple of guys who just
blew off somebody's head.

1869
02:09:40,606 --> 02:09:43,984
Strippin' off those bloody rags
is absolutely necessary.

1870
02:09:48,281 --> 02:09:50,740
Toss 'em in Jimmie's
garbage bag.

1871
02:09:50,825 --> 02:09:55,245
Don't do nothin' stupid, like leavin' this
shit out front for the garbage man to pick up.

1872
02:09:55,329 --> 02:09:59,541
Don't worry, we're taking it with us.
Jim, the soap.

1873
02:10:01,002 --> 02:10:02,919
Vincent. [WOLF]
Okay, gentlemen.

1874
02:10:03,004 --> 02:10:06,464
You both been to county
before, I'm sure. Here it comes.

1875
02:10:06,590 --> 02:10:09,467
Goddamn! The water's fuckin' cold!
Yo! Yo! Yo!

1876
02:10:09,552 --> 02:10:12,721
Better you than me, gentlemen.
[CHUCKLING]

1877
02:10:12,847 --> 02:10:15,765
Don't be afraid of the soap. Spread it around.
[YELLING CONTINUES]

1878
02:10:15,850 --> 02:10:18,727
- Get 'em there a little bit. Vincent's hair.
- Hey, get out of my hair!

1879
02:10:18,811 --> 02:10:21,688
- Come on, do it, goddamn it! Do it!
- Uh, um-.

1880
02:10:22,773 --> 02:10:24,691
Towel.

1881
02:10:35,202 --> 02:10:38,371
[WOLF] You're dry enough.
Toss 'em their clothes.

1882
02:10:38,456 --> 02:10:41,750
[WOLF LAUGHING] Perfect.

1883
02:10:41,834 --> 02:10:45,253
Perfect. We couldn't have
planned this better.

1884
02:10:45,338 --> 02:10:47,255
You guys look like-.

1885
02:10:47,340 --> 02:10:49,716
What do they look like, Jimmie?

1886
02:10:49,842 --> 02:10:53,428
Dorks. They look like a couple of dorks.
[LAUGHING]

1887
02:10:53,512 --> 02:10:57,015
- [BOTH LAUGHING]
- Ha-ha-ha. They're your clothes, motherfucker.

1888
02:10:57,099 --> 02:10:59,809
Come on, gentlemen. We're laughing
our way right into prison.

1889
02:10:59,894 --> 02:11:01,853
Don't make me beg.

1890
02:11:04,899 --> 02:11:08,318
Okay, gentlemen, let's get our
rules of the road straight.

1891
02:11:08,402 --> 02:11:11,946
We're going to a place called
Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.

1892
02:11:12,031 --> 02:11:14,949
Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel
are sympathetic to our dilemma.

1893
02:11:15,034 --> 02:11:16,910
The place is North Hollywood,

1894
02:11:16,994 --> 02:11:20,997
so a few twists and turns aside,
we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.

1895
02:11:21,082 --> 02:11:24,417
Now, I'll drive the tainted car.
Jules, you ride with me.

1896
02:11:25,795 --> 02:11:27,754
Vincent, you follow
in my Acura.

1897
02:11:27,838 --> 02:11:31,674
Now, if we come across the
path of any John Q. Laws,

1898
02:11:31,801 --> 02:11:34,886
nobody does a fuckin' thing
'til I do something. Right.

1899
02:11:35,012 --> 02:11:37,847
What did I say?
Don't do shit unless.

1900
02:11:37,973 --> 02:11:40,266
Unless what?
Unless you do it first.

1901
02:11:40,351 --> 02:11:42,727
Spoken like a true prodigy.

1902
02:11:42,812 --> 02:11:46,231
How about you, Lash LaRue? Can you keep
your spurs from jingling and jangling?

1903
02:11:46,315 --> 02:11:50,443
The gun went off. I don't know why.
I'm cool, I promise you.

1904
02:11:50,528 --> 02:11:53,446
Fair enough. Now, I drive real
fuckin' fast, so keep up.

1905
02:11:53,531 --> 02:11:56,032
If I get my car back any
different than I gave it,

1906
02:11:56,117 --> 02:11:58,993
Monster Joe's gonna be
disposing of two bodies.

1907
02:11:59,078 --> 02:12:02,789
[METAL DOOR SLAMMING]
[ENGINE IDLING]

1908
02:12:02,873 --> 02:12:04,582
Outta my way, Rex.

1909
02:12:06,127 --> 02:12:08,545
- We cool?
- Like it never happened.

1910
02:12:08,629 --> 02:12:12,382
- [VINCENT] All right.
- Boys, this is Raquel.

1911
02:12:12,466 --> 02:12:15,093
Someday all this will be hers.

1912
02:12:15,177 --> 02:12:17,971
Hi. So, what's with the outfits?

1913
02:12:18,097 --> 02:12:21,516
You guys going to a volleyball
game or something? [WOLF LAUGHS]

1914
02:12:21,600 --> 02:12:24,060
I'm takin' milady
out to breakfast.

1915
02:12:24,145 --> 02:12:26,813
Maybe I could drop you two off.
Where do you live?

1916
02:12:26,939 --> 02:12:28,314
Redondo.
Inglewood.

1917
02:12:28,399 --> 02:12:31,818
It's-
It's your future. I...

1918
02:12:31,902 --> 02:12:34,654
I see a-a cab ride.

1919
02:12:34,738 --> 02:12:37,699
Move outta the sticks, fellas.
Say good night, Raquel.

02:22:19,614 --> 02:22:22,533
You let him go!
You let him go!

2077
02:22:22,617 --> 02:22:25,536
- Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you!
- Tell that bitch to be cool.

2078
02:22:25,662 --> 02:22:28,581
Say, "Bitch, be cool!" Say,
"Bitch, be cool!" Be cool! Be cool!

2079
02:22:28,665 --> 02:22:31,333
- Tell that bitch to chill!
- You're gonna die so fuckin' bad!

2080
02:22:31,460 --> 02:22:34,336
Chill that fuckin' bitch out!
Chill out, honey bunny!

2081
02:22:34,421 --> 02:22:36,172
- Let go of him!
- Chill out, honey bunny!

2082
02:22:36,298 --> 02:22:39,175
Now, promise her it's gonna be all right!
I promise!

2083
02:22:39,301 --> 02:22:41,135
Tell her to chill!
Chill out, honey bunny!

2084
02:22:41,261 --> 02:22:43,179
Now tell me her name.
Yolanda.

2085
02:22:43,263 --> 02:22:46,682
All right, now, Yolanda, we're not
gonna do anything stupid, are we?

2086
02:22:46,767 --> 02:22:49,685
- Don't you hurt him!
- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody!

2087
02:22:49,770 --> 02:22:53,230
We're all gonna be like three little Fonzies here.
And what's Fonzie like?

2088
02:22:53,356 --> 02:22:56,984
Come on, Yolanda! What's Fonzie like?
He's cool.

2089
02:22:57,110 --> 02:22:58,986
What?
Cool.

2090
02:22:59,071 --> 02:23:01,906
Correctamundo.
And that's what we're gonna be.

2091
02:23:01,990 --> 02:23:03,908
We're gonna be cool.

2092
02:23:03,992 --> 02:23:08,871
Now, Ringo,
I'm gonna count to three.

2093
02:23:08,955 --> 02:23:11,040
And when I count three,

2094
02:23:11,124 --> 02:23:14,043
I want you to
let go of your gun,

2095
02:23:14,127 --> 02:23:17,630
put your palms flat on the table
and sit your ass down.

2096
02:23:18,673 --> 02:23:20,716
And when you do it,

2097
02:23:20,801 --> 02:23:22,885
you do it cool.

2098
02:23:22,969 --> 02:23:25,262
You ready?

2099
02:23:25,347 --> 02:23:27,431
One,

2100
02:23:27,516 --> 02:23:29,725
two,

2101
02:23:29,810 --> 02:23:31,727
three.

2102
02:23:38,693 --> 02:23:41,821
[PANTING] Okay, now you let him go!
Yolanda!

2103
02:23:41,905 --> 02:23:45,491
I thought you were gonna be cool. Now,
when you yell at me, it makes me nervous.

2104
02:23:45,575 --> 02:23:47,660
When I get nervous,
I get scared.

2105
02:23:47,744 --> 02:23:51,539
When motherfuckers get scared, that's
when motherfuckers accidentally get shot.

2106
02:23:53,208 --> 02:23:56,836
Just know,
you hurt him, you die.

2107
02:23:56,920 --> 02:24:00,297
Well, that seems to be
the situation.

2108
02:24:00,382 --> 02:24:02,299
But I don't want that.

2109
02:24:02,384 --> 02:24:04,301
And you don't want that.

2110
02:24:04,386 --> 02:24:07,096
And Ringo here definitely
doesn't want that.

2111
02:24:07,180 --> 02:24:09,306
So let's see what we can do.

2112
02:24:11,685 --> 02:24:14,937
Now...
here's the situation.

2113
02:24:15,021 --> 02:24:18,858
Normally both your asses would be
dead as fuckin' fried chicken,

2114
02:24:18,942 --> 02:24:22,361
but you happened to pull this shit
while I'm in a transitional period,

2115
02:24:22,445 --> 02:24:25,364
and I don't wanna kill you;
I wanna help you.

2116
02:24:25,448 --> 02:24:29,368
But I can't give you this case,
'cause it don't belong to me.

2117
02:24:29,452 --> 02:24:32,371
Besides, I been through too much
shit over this case this morning...

2118
02:24:32,455 --> 02:24:35,374
to just hand it over
to your dumb ass.

2119
02:24:35,458 --> 02:24:37,251
- Vincent!
- [YELLS]

2120
02:24:37,377 --> 02:24:40,296
Be cool! Yolanda, it's cool, baby.
Get back!

2121
02:24:40,380 --> 02:24:43,048
It's cool!
We still just talkin'.

2122
02:24:43,175 --> 02:24:46,594
Come on. Point the gun at me. Point the gun at me.
[YOLANDA WHIMPERING]

2123
02:24:46,678 --> 02:24:49,471
There you go.
Now, Vincent, you just hang back...

2124
02:24:49,556 --> 02:24:51,473
and don't do a goddamn thing.

2125
02:24:51,558 --> 02:24:53,434
Tell her it's still cool.

2126
02:24:53,560 --> 02:24:56,437
It's still cool, honey bunny.
How we doin', baby?

2127
02:24:57,898 --> 02:25:00,524
I- I gotta go pee.

2128
02:25:00,609 --> 02:25:02,526
I wanna go home.

2129
02:25:02,611 --> 02:25:06,197
Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you.
And Ringo's proud of you.

2130
02:25:06,281 --> 02:25:09,200
It's almost over.
Tell her you're proud of her.

2131
02:25:09,284 --> 02:25:12,578
- I'm proud of you, honey bunny.
- I love you.

2132
02:25:12,704 --> 02:25:15,873
I love you too, honey bunny.
Now,

2133
02:25:15,957 --> 02:25:19,919
I want you to go in that
bag and find my wallet.

2134
02:25:22,422 --> 02:25:26,383
Which one is it? It's the one
that says "bad motherfucker."

2135
02:25:40,649 --> 02:25:43,192
That's it. That's my
bad motherfucker.

2136
02:25:43,276 --> 02:25:46,403
Open it up.
Take out the money.

2137
02:25:51,409 --> 02:25:53,619
[JULES] Count it.

2138
02:25:59,918 --> 02:26:02,461
How much is there?

2139
02:26:04,339 --> 02:26:06,257
About 1,500 dollars.

2140
02:26:06,341 --> 02:26:09,510
Okay, put it in your pocket.
It's yours.

2141
02:26:09,594 --> 02:26:12,805
Now, with the rest of those
wallets and the register,

2142
02:26:12,889 --> 02:26:15,009
that makes this a pretty
successful little score, huh?

2143
02:26:15,058 --> 02:26:18,936
Jules, you give that fuckin' nimrod 1,500
dollars, and I'll shoot him on general principle.

2144
02:26:19,020 --> 02:26:22,439
No, Yolanda! Yolanda! He ain't gonna
do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing!

2145
02:26:22,524 --> 02:26:24,566
Vince, shut the fuck up!

2146
02:26:24,693 --> 02:26:28,570
Shut up! Come on, Yolanda.
Stay with me, baby.

2147
02:26:28,655 --> 02:26:31,573
Now, I ain't givin' it
to him, Vincent.

2148
02:26:31,658 --> 02:26:33,534
I'm buyin' something
for my money.

2149
02:26:34,828 --> 02:26:37,997
Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo?
What?

2150
02:26:38,081 --> 02:26:42,793
Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't have to kill your ass.

2151
02:26:42,877 --> 02:26:45,546
You read the Bible, Ringo?

2152
02:26:46,673 --> 02:26:48,590
Not regularly, no.

2153
02:26:48,675 --> 02:26:51,051
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

2154
02:26:51,136 --> 02:26:54,680
Ezekiel 25:17.

2155
02:26:54,764 --> 02:26:57,599
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

2156
02:26:57,684 --> 02:26:59,601
"by the inequities of the selfish...

2157
02:26:59,686 --> 02:27:01,562
"and the tyranny of evil men.

2158
02:27:01,646 --> 02:27:05,024
"Blessed is he who, in the name of charity
and good will,

2159
02:27:05,108 --> 02:27:07,526
"shepherds the weak
through the Valley of darkness,

2160
02:27:07,610 --> 02:27:11,697
"for he is truly his brother's keeper
and the finder of lost children.

2161
02:27:11,781 --> 02:27:16,076
"And I will strike down upon thee with
great Vengeance and furious anger...

2162
02:27:16,161 --> 02:27:19,204
"those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers.

2163
02:27:19,289 --> 02:27:22,291
"And you will know
I am the Lord...

2164
02:27:22,375 --> 02:27:25,919
when I lay my vengeance
upon you."

2165
02:27:27,047 --> 02:27:29,465
I been sayin' that shit
for years,

2166
02:27:29,549 --> 02:27:32,676
and if you heard it,
that meant your ass.

2167
02:27:32,761 --> 02:27:35,679
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.

2168
02:27:35,764 --> 02:27:38,682
I just thought it was some coldblooded
shit to say to a motherfucker...

2169
02:27:38,767 --> 02:27:41,185
before I popped a cap
in his ass.

2170
02:27:41,269 --> 02:27:44,688
But I saw some shit this morning
made me think twice.

2171
02:27:44,773 --> 02:27:47,691
See, now I'm thinkin'
maybe it means...

2172
02:27:47,776 --> 02:27:52,654
you're the evil man,
and I'm the righteous man,

2173
02:27:52,739 --> 02:27:55,657
and Mr. 9-millimeter here,
he's the shepherd...

2174
02:27:55,742 --> 02:27:59,286
protecting my righteous ass
in the Valley of Darkness.

2175
02:27:59,371 --> 02:28:01,288
Or it could mean...

2176
02:28:01,373 --> 02:28:04,792
you're the righteous man,
and I'm the shepherd,

2177
02:28:04,876 --> 02:28:08,796
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.

2178
02:28:08,880 --> 02:28:11,131
Yeah, I'd like that.

2179
02:28:11,216 --> 02:28:14,093
But that shit ain't the truth.

2180
02:28:14,177 --> 02:28:16,053
The truth is,

2181
02:28:17,097 --> 02:28:19,056
you're the weak...

2182
02:28:20,433 --> 02:28:23,811
and I'm the tyranny of evil men.

2183
02:28:25,271 --> 02:28:27,189
But I'm tryin', Ringo.

2184
02:28:28,441 --> 02:28:31,360
I'm tryin' real hard...

2185
02:28:31,444 --> 02:28:33,737
to be the shepherd.

2186
02:28:49,045 --> 02:28:50,963
Go.

2187
02:29:08,648 --> 02:29:11,024
