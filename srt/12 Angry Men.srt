00:00:04,594 --> 00:00:10,594
A Team Nanban (594mgnav) Release

2
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:18,745
Thank you very much, sir.

3
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:20,997
You did a wonderful job. Wonderful.

4
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:23,458
Shh. Shh.

5
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:24,959
We did it, Pete. We did it.

6
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:28,755
- For a moment, we had our doubts.
- Shh.

7
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:32,258
To continue, you've listened
to a long and complex case...

8
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,135
murder in the first degree.

9
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:39,182
A premeditated murder is the most serious
charge tried in our criminal courts.

10
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:41,017
You've listened to the testimony.

11
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:44,020
You've had the law read to you and
interpreted as it applies in this case.

12
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:48,124
It's now your duty to sit down and try
and separate the facts from the fancy.

13
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:52,587
One man is dead. Another
man's life is at stake.

14
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,366
If there's a reasonable doubt in your
minds as to the guilt of the accused...

15
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,368
a reasonable doubt...

16
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,246
then you must bring me
a verdict of not guilty.

17
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,207
Now if, however, there's
no reasonable doubt...

18
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:08,185
then you must in good conscience
find the accused guilty.

19
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:13,424
However you decide, your
verdict must be unanimous.

20
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,886
In the event that you find
the accused guilty...

21
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:20,306
the bench will not entertain
a recommendation for mercy.

22
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,601
The death sentence is
mandatory in this case.

23
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:27,413
You're faced with a grave responsibility.
Thank you, gentlemen.

24
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,459
The alternate jurors are excused.

25
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,467
The jury will now retire.

26
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,462
Try this one.
See if I can get it...

27
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,548
It's a muggy day.

28
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,162
Hey. Oh, oh.

29
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,301
- Piece of gum?
- No, thanks.

30
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,470
This thing is...

31
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,197
- Huh?
- ... move it.

32
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,976
- Come on, I'll give you a hand.
- Give me a hand with that.

33
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,410
That's it.

34
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,651
- You know something?
- Yeah?

35
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,486
I called the weather
bureau this morning.

36
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,488
This is gonna be the
hottest day of the year.

37
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,156
Could be.

38
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,158
Boy, you'd think they'd at least
air-condition these places.

39
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,578
- What is your name, sir?
- Oh, it's, uh... That one, yeah.

40
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,080
Thank you very much.

41
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,916
Okay, gentlemen, everybody's here.

42
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,836
Now, if there's anything you want,
I'll be right outside the door.

43
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,188
- Just knock.
- Okay, thanks. We will.

44
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,893
Good morning.

45
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,437
I never knew they locked the door.

46
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,705
Sure they lock the door.
What'd you think?

47
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,209
I don't know. It just
never occurred to me.

48
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:03,612
What's that for?

49
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,573
Oh, I thought we might
want to vote by ballot.

50
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:08,325
Great idea. Maybe we can
get him elected senator.

51
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,346
Just in case, you know.

52
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:17,960
- How'd you like it?
- Oh, I don't know.

53
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,712
It was pretty interesting.

54
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,756
Yeah? I almost fell asleep.

55
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:24,425
I mean, I've never
been on a jury before.

56
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,236
No? I've sat on many juries.

57
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:31,307
What gets me is the way those
lawyers talk and talk and talk...

58
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,559
even when it's an open-and-shut
case like this one.

59
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,352
Did you ever hear so
much talk about nothin'?

60
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,313
Well, I guess they're entitled.

61
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,874
Yeah. They're entitled.
It's the system, but...

62
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:45,154
If you ask me, I'd slap those tough kids
down before they start any trouble.

63
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,323
It would save us a lot
of time and money.

64
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,949
- Hey, let's get started, huh?
- That's a good idea.

65
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,660
Yeah, let's get goin', huh? We
probably all got things to do here.

66
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,434
I figured we'd start out
with a five-minute break.

67
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,789
There's one gentleman
in the bathroom.

68
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,831
- Mr. Foreman.
- Huh?

69
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,709
- Are, uh... Are we gonna sit in order?
- Gee, I don't know.

70
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,561
I, uh... Well, I guess so.

71
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,009
Uh, you're in my seat.

72
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,111
- Oh. Excuse me.
- That's all right.

73
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,407
Hey, that's not a bad view, huh?

74
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,480
What did you think of the case?

75
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,607
I mean, it had a lot
of interest for me.

76
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,835
No real... dead spots.
You know what I mean?

77
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,155
I tell you, we were lucky
to get a murder case.

78
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,199
I figured us for an
assault or burglary.

79
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,535
Boy, they can be the dullest.

80
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,412
Hey.

81
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,081
That the Woolworth Building?

82
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,083
That's right.

83
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,751
Isn't that funny?

84
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,212
You know, I've lived here all my life.
I've never been inside that.

85
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,381
If you had to
sort out all that junk...

86
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,550
Like that thing with the movies.

87
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:50,636
Yeah. You can say that again. And what
about that business with the knife?

88
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,597
I mean, asking grown-up people
to believe that kind of jazz, huh?

89
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,142
Well, I expected that.
You know what we're dealing with.

90
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,686
Yeah, I guess so.

91
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,479
Well, your horn works.
Now try your lights.

92
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,607
- What do you got, a cold?
- And how.

93
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,901
These hot-weather
colds can kill you.

94
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,404
I can hardly touch my nose.
You know what I mean?

95
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:12,032
I sure do. I just got over one.

96
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,306
Aw, come on. Mr. Foreman,
let's go here, huh?

97
00:08:14,332 --> 00:08:16,579
Well, that guy's still
in the bathroom.

98
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,498
Hey, what's new? I didn't get a
chance to see a paper this morning.

99
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,666
Hmm?

100
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,169
I was only wondering
how the market closed.

101
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,963
You got a seat on the Exchange?

102
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,798
I'm a broker.

103
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:32,261
I run a messenger service...
the Beck and Call Company.

104
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,471
The name is my wife's idea.

105
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:38,184
Got 37 men working.
Started with nothing.

106
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:41,437
Okay, men, let's
take our seats, huh?

107
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,442
Yeah, we can all get outta
here pretty quick, huh?

108
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,532
I don't know about the rest of you,

109
00:08:47,558 --> 00:08:49,737
but I happen to have tickets
to that ball game tonight.

110
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,655
Yanks and Cleveland.

111
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,532
Yeah, we got this kid,
Modjelewski, in there.

112
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,284
Ooh, he's a real bull, this kid.

113
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,494
You know... Phoom!

114
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,830
A real jug handle. You know?

115
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,166
Phoom!

116
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,585
You're a real baseball fan,
aren't you? Huh? Yeah.

117
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,128
Where do we sit here?

118
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:09,298
Well, I thought we'd sit in order,
you know, by jury numbers.

119
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,800
One, two, three, four, five...
so on, around the table.

120
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,135
If that's okay with you gentlemen.

121
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,303
- Sure.
- What's the difference?

122
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,431
- I think it's reasonable to sit in order.
- Let it be.

123
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,767
- Number 12. Do I sit down here?
- Yeah. That's 12. We go around...

124
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:23,103
- We start with you. One, right?
- One, yeah. Two, three, four, five, six.

125
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,522
What was your impression of
the prosecuting attorney?

126
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,316
Okay. Two. You're two.

127
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,567
I beg pardon?

128
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,821
I thought he was really sharp, the way
he handled all those points one by one.

129
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:36,033
Logical sequence.
I was very impressed.

130
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:39,119
I think he... he did an expert job.

131
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,206
A lot of drive too,
you know? Real drive.

132
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,941
Okay, fellas, can we
hold it down a minute?

133
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:44,375
Sure.

134
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,043
Uh, fellas.

135
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:49,605
Say, we'd like to get started.
Gentleman at the window.

136
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,425
- We'd like to get started.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

137
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:57,179
Pretty tough to figure, isn't it? Kid
kills his father... bing, just like that.

138
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,848
Aw, listen, you analyze the figures,
you'll see it happens all the time.

139
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,850
They let those kids
run wild up there.

140
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,645
Well, maybe it serves 'em right.
You know what I mean?

141
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,313
Is... Is everyone here?

142
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,232
The old man is inside.

143
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,943
Oh. Would you, uh,
knock on the door for him?

144
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,987
You a Yankee fan?

145
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:14,630
No. Baltimore.

146
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,049
- Baltimore?
- Yeah.

147
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,869
That's like being hit in the head
with a crowbar once a day.

148
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:23,872
Who have they got?

149
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,375
No, I mean, who have they got
besides good groundskeepers?

150
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,002
Say, uh, we'd like to get started.

151
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:31,146
Oh, forgive me, gentlemen.
I... I didn't mean to keep you waiting.

152
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,716
Baltimore?

153
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:36,593
Okay, gentlemen,
if I can have your attention.

154
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,638
You fellas can handle this thing
any way that you want to.

155
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,224
I'm, um... You know,
I'm not gonna make any rules.

156
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:45,602
Uh, we can, well, discuss it
first and, uh, then vote on it.

157
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,355
That's, of course, uh...
That's, uh, one way.

158
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,400
And, uh, well, we can vote
on it right now, and...

159
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,986
I think it's customary to
take a preliminary vote.

160
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,656
Yeah, let's... Let's vote. Who knows?
Maybe we all can get outta here, huh?

161
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,450
Uh-huh.

162
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:02,619
Okay, then I think that, uh...

163
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,581
Of course you know that we have a
first-degree murder charge here...

164
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,750
and if we vote the
accused guilty...

165
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:11,086
uh, we've got to send
him to the chair.

166
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,923
- Um, that's mandatory.
- I think we know that.

167
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,759
- Let's see who's where.
- We might as well.

168
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,654
- Okay. Uh, anyone doesn't want to vote?
- All right with me.

169
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:26,435
Okay. Then, uh, just remember that this
has to be 12 to nothing either way.

170
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,978
Um, that's the law.

171
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,105
Okay, are we ready?

172
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,208
Now, all those voting guilty,
please raise your hands.

173
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,716
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

174
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,620
eight, nine, 10, 11.

175
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,623
Okay. That's 11 guilty.

176
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,224
Those voting not guilty.

177
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,461
One. Right.

178
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,855
That's 11 guilty. One not guilty.

179
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,341
Well, now we know where we are.

180
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:01,612
Boy, oh, boy. There's always one.

181
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,431
So, what do we do now?

182
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,350
Well, I guess we talk.

183
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,768
Boy, oh, boy.

184
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,703
You really think he's innocent?

185
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,691
I don't know.

186
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,653
I mean, you sat in court with the
rest of us. You heard what we did.

187
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,863
The kid's a dangerous killer.
You could see it.

188
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,573
He's 18 years old.

189
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,742
Well, that's old enough. He...

190
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,495
He stabbed his own father
four inches into the chest.

191
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,831
They proved it a dozen
different ways in court.

192
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:31,458
Would you like me to
list them for you?

193
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,835
No.

194
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:35,003
Then what do you want?

195
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:38,006
- I just want to talk.
- What's there to talk about?

196
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,425
Eleven men in here
think he's guilty.

197
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,760
No one had to think about
it twice except you.

198
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,055
I want to ask you something.
Do you believe his story?

199
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,850
I don't know whether I believe
it or not. Maybe I don't.

200
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,518
So how come you vote not guilty?

201
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,520
Well, there were 11
votes for guilty.

202
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,356
It's not easy to raise my hand
and send a boy off to die...

203
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,525
without talking about it first.

204
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:59,044
- Well, now, who says it's easy?
- No one.

205
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,489
What, just because I voted fast?

206
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,992
I honestly think the guy's guilty.

207
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,870
You couldn't change my mind if
you talked for a hundred years.

208
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,972
I'm not trying to change
your mind. It's just that...

209
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,791
We're talking about
somebody's life here.

210
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,960
We can't decide it in five minutes.
Supposing we're wrong.

211
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,462
"Supposing we're wrong."

212
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,547
Supposing this whole building
should fall down on my head.

213
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,649
- You can suppose anything.
- That's right.

214
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,218
Look, what's the difference
how long it takes?

215
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,888
Suppose we do it in
five minutes. So what?

216
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,098
Let's take an hour.

217
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,117
The ball game doesn't
start till 8:00.

218
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:33,996
Hmm?

219
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,983
Who's got something to say?

220
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,485
I'm willing to sit for an hour.

221
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,279
Great. I heard a pretty
good story last night.

222
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,464
That's not why we're sitting here.

223
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,719
All right, then you tell me.
What are we sitting here for?

224
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,805
I don't know. Maybe no reason.

225
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:56,251
Look, this kid's been kicked
around all of his life...

226
00:13:56,252 --> 00:14:00,255
you know, born in a slum,
mother dead since he was nine.

227
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,549
He lived for a year and a half
in an orphanage when his...

228
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,552
his father was serving a
jail term for forgery.

229
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,971
It's not a very happy beginning.

230
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,182
He's a... a wild, angry kid.

231
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,975
That's all he's ever been.
And you know why?

232
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,771
'Cause he's been hit on the head
by somebody once a day every day.

233
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,065
He's had a... He's had a
pretty miserable 18 years.

234
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:21,109
I... I just think we owe
him a few words. That's all.

235
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,738
I don't mind telling you this, mister.
We don't owe him a thing.

236
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,908
He got a fair trial, didn't he?
What do you think that trial cost?

237
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,873
He's lucky he got it.
You know what I mean?

238
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:33,497
- You know it.
- Now, look, we're all grown-ups in here.

239
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,457
We heard the facts, didn't we?

240
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:39,336
You're not gonna tell me that we're supposed
to believe this kid, knowing what he is.

241
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,797
Listen, I've lived among
them all my life.

242
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:45,217
You can't believe a word they say.
You know that.

243
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,135
I mean, they're born liars.

244
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,556
- Only an ignorant man can believe that.
- Now listen...

245
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,475
Do you think you were born
with a monopoly on the truth?

246
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:56,144
I think certain things should
be pointed out to this man.

247
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,313
Come on. This isn't Sunday.
We don't need a sermon.

248
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,666
Come on. We have a job
to do. Now let's do it.

249
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,753
Rice Pops. It's a product
I work on at the agency.

250
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,198
"The breakfast with
the built-in bounce."

251
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,908
- I wrote that line.
- Very catchy.

252
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,160
- Yeah.
- Say, do you mind?

253
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,954
Oh, I'm sorry.

254
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,498
I have this habit of doodling.
Keeps me thinking clearly.

255
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,292
Yeah, we have all this work to do.

256
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,085
- There's no point staying here forever.
- Sorry.

257
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:20,919
Okay. Um...

258
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,379
Okay. Um...

259
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,258
perhaps if the gentleman down there
who's disagreeing with us...

260
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,636
Well, perhaps you could tell us why. You
know, let us know what you're thinking.

261
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,097
And we might be able to show
you where you're mixed up.

262
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,849
Well, look, maybe...
Maybe this is an idea.

263
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,351
Now, I haven't given it much
thought, but it seems to me...

264
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,706
that it's up to the
group of us to convince

265
00:15:38,732 --> 00:15:40,856
this gentleman that he's
wrong and we're right.

266
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,500
Now, maybe if we each took a
couple of minutes just to...

267
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,320
Well, it was just a quick idea.

268
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:47,863
No, no, no. That's a good one.

269
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:51,033
Uh, suppose we go once
around the table.

270
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,994
- I guess you're first.
- Oh.

271
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,429
Well, uh...

272
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,391
Well, it-it's hard
to put into words.

273
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,419
I just think he's guilty.

274
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,005
I thought it was obvious
from the word "go."

275
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,590
I mean, nobody proved otherwise.

276
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,216
Nobody has to prove otherwise.

277
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,552
The burden of proof's
on the prosecution.

278
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,096
The defendant doesn't even
have to open his mouth.

279
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:16,308
- That's in the Constitution.
- Oh, well, sure, I know that.

280
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,368
Uh, what I meant was, is...

281
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:22,147
Well, I just think he's guilty.

282
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,940
I-I mean, somebody saw him do it.

283
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:29,071
Okay. Uh, here's what I think, and I
have no personal feelings about this.

284
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,339
I just want to talk about facts.

285
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,468
Number one.

286
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:39,122
The old man lived downstairs under the
room where the killing took place.

287
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,333
At 10 minutes after 12:00
on the night of the killing...

288
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:45,087
he heard loud noises,
said it sounded like a fight.

289
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:48,048
And he heard the kid yell out,
"I'm gonna kill ya."

290
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,425
A second later, he heard
a body hit the floor.

291
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,219
Ran to the door, opened it up...

292
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,721
saw the kid running down the
stairs and out of the house.

293
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,098
Called the police.

294
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:58,850
They came in, found the old man
with a knife in his chest.

295
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,187
The coroner fixed the time
of death around midnight.

296
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:05,357
Now these are facts.
You can't refute facts.

297
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,609
The kid is guilty.

298
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,695
I'm just as sentimental
as the next fella.

299
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:13,657
I know he's only 18, but he's still
gotta pay for what he did.

300
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,200
I'm with you.

301
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,828
Okay. Are you finished?

302
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,371
- Yeah.
- Right. Next.

303
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,666
It is obvious, to me anyway,
that the boy's entire story was flimsy.

304
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,960
He claimed he was at the movies
during the time of the killing...

305
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,587
and yet, one hour later, he couldn't
remember the names of the films he saw...

306
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,506
- or who played in them.
- That's right.

307
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,883
And no one saw him going
in or out of the theater.

308
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,593
Listen, what about the
woman across the street?

309
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,971
If her testimony don't
prove it, nothing does.

310
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,390
That's right. She was the one
who actually saw the killing.

311
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,892
Now, fellas, please.
Let's go in order here, huh?

312
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,229
Just a minute. Here's a woman...

313
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,773
Here's a woman who was
lying in bed. She can't sleep.

314
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,775
She's dying with the heat.
You know what I mean?

315
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,694
Anyway, she looks out the window...

316
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:54,364
and right across the street she sees
the kid stick the knife into his father.

317
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:57,325
The time is 12:10 on the nose.

318
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:01,204
Everything fits. Look, she's
known the kid all his life.

319
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,415
His window is right opposite
hers across the el tracks...

320
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,167
and she swore she saw him do it.

321
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,369
Through the windows of
the passing el train.

322
00:18:07,395 --> 00:18:12,174
Right. This el train had no passengers
on it. It was just being moved downtown.

323
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:15,177
The lights were out, remember?
And they proved in court that, at night...

324
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,679
you can look through the windows of an
el train when the lights are out...

325
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,098
and see what's happening
on the other side.

326
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,018
- They proved it.
- I'd like to ask you something.

327
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,771
You don't believe the boy's story.
How come you believe the woman's?

328
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,622
She's one of them too, isn't she?

329
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:32,277
You're a pretty smart
fella, aren't you?

330
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,779
- Okay, gentlemen.
- Now, now.

331
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,072
- Now, gentlemen.
- Come on. Sit down. Sit down.

332
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,700
Oh, what's he so wise about?
I'm telling you.

333
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:42,037
Okay, now come on. Now we're
not gonna get anywhere fighting.

334
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,371
Whose turn is it next?

335
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,308
Oh, uh, his. Number five.

336
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,313
Okay, may I... Can I pass? it...

337
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,132
Well, uh, that's your privilege.

338
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,344
Uh, how about the next gentleman?

339
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:00,096
Oh. Well, uh, I don't know.

340
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:04,409
I started to be convinced,
you know, very early in the case.

341
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:09,105
You see, I was looking for a motive.
That's very important.

342
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:13,401
Because if you don't have a motive,
where's your case, right?

343
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,571
Anyway, that, uh, testimony
from those people...

344
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,699
in the apartment across the hall
from the kid's apartment...

345
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,035
that was very powerful.

346
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,913
Didn't they say something about a...
a fight and an argument...

347
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:29,417
between the old man and his son
around about, uh, 7:00 that night?

348
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,962
- I mean, I could be wrong, but I...
- It was 8:00.

349
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:34,089
It was 8:00. That's right.
They heard an argument.

350
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,924
They couldn't hear
what it was about.

351
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,968
Then they heard the
father hit the boy twice.

352
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:40,082
Finally they saw the boy run...

353
00:19:40,108 --> 00:19:42,681
angrily out of the house.
What does that prove?

354
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:46,434
Well, it don't exactly prove anything.
It's just part of the picture.

355
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,437
Well, you said it provided a motive. The
prosecuting attorney said the same thing.

356
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,773
I don't think that was
a very strong motive.

357
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:55,443
This boy's been hit so many times in his
life that violence is practically a...

358
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,904
It's a normal state
of affairs with him.

359
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:02,200
I just... I can't see two slaps in the face
provoking him into committing murder.

360
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,887
It may have been two too many.
Everyone has a breaking point.

361
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,500
Anything else?

362
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:13,044
- No.
- Okay.

363
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,896
Uh, how about you?

364
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,692
I don't know. It's all been said.

365
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,862
You can talk here forever.
It's still the same thing.

366
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:27,017
This kid is five for 0.

367
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:28,977
Well, look at his record.

368
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,271
When he was 10,
he was in children's court.

369
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:33,148
He threw a rock at a teacher.

370
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:35,525
When he was 15,
he was in reform school.

371
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,444
He stole a car.

372
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:40,030
He's been arrested for mugging.

373
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:42,115
He was picked up twice
for knife fighting.

374
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,284
Oh, yeah, they say he's
real handy with a knife.

375
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:47,162
Oh, this is a very fine boy.

376
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:50,248
Ever since he was five years old,
his father beat him up regularly.

377
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,751
- He used his fists.
- Well, so would I.

378
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,336
A kid like that?

379
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:57,605
It's these kids, the way
they are nowadays.

380
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:03,278
When I was a kid,
I used to call my father "sir."

381
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,305
That's right. "Sir."

382
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,349
Do you ever hear a kid call
his father that any more?

383
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,951
Fathers don't seem to think
it's important any more.

384
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:12,787
- You got any kids?
- Three.

385
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:15,498
I got one.

386
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,752
Twenty-two years old.

387
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,635
When he was nine years old,
he ran away from a fight.

388
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:32,515
I saw it. I was so embarrassed
I almost threw up.

389
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:38,813
I said, "I'm gonna make a man out of you
if I have to break you in two trying."

390
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,234
Well, I made a man out of him.

391
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,404
When he was 16, we had a fight.

392
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,366
Hit me in the jaw.
He was a big kid.

393
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:55,872
Haven't seen him for two years.

394
00:21:57,692 --> 00:22:00,085
Kids.

395
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:03,755
Work your heart out.

396
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:07,575
Well, let's get going.

397
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,995
I think we're missing
the point here.

398
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:13,498
This boy, let's say he's the product of a
broken home and a filthy neighborhood.

399
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:17,168
We can't help that. We're here to decide
whether he's innocent or guilty...

400
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,171
not to go into the reasons why
he grew up the way he did.

401
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,966
He was born in a slum. Slums are
breeding grounds for criminals.

402
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,926
I know it, and so do you.

403
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,185
It's no secret children
from slum backgrounds

404
00:22:27,211 --> 00:22:29,423
are potential menaces to society.

405
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:31,975
- Now I think...
- Brother, you can say that again.

406
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:34,246
The kids who crawl out of
these places are real trash.

407
00:22:34,272 --> 00:22:37,476
- I don't want any part of them.
I'm telling you.
- Listen, mister. Listen.

408
00:22:37,502 --> 00:22:39,571
I, uh... I've lived in
a slum all my life.

409
00:22:39,597 --> 00:22:41,435
- Wait a minute.
- Please, I...

410
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:44,237
I played in backyards that
were filled with garbage.

411
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:46,364
I mean, maybe you can
still smell it on me.

412
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,782
Now, listen, sonny.

413
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,451
Come on now. There's nothing
personal about this.

414
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:52,078
- No, there was something personal.
- Aw, come on, fella. He didn't mean you.

415
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,247
Let's not be so sensitive.

416
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:56,166
This sensitivity I can understand.

417
00:22:56,167 --> 00:23:00,895
Okay, look, let's stop the arguing.
We're only wasting time, and...

418
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:04,190
Look, your turn down
there. Let's go.

419
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:08,344
Oh, I didn't expect a turn. I thought
you were all gonna try to convince me.

420
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,180
- Wasn't that the idea?
- Check. That was the idea.

421
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:12,474
- Oh, I forgot about that. He's right.
- What difference does it make?

422
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:14,893
He's the one who's keeping us in here.
Let's hear what he's got to say.

423
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,687
Oh, now wait a minute. We decided
to do this a certain way.

424
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,397
I think we ought to
stick to that way.

425
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,483
Oh, stop being a kid, will you?

426
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:23,568
- What do you mean "a kid"?
- What do you think I mean?

427
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,295
K-I-D. Kid.

428
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:31,534
What? Listen, just because I'm
trying to keep this thing organized?

429
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,745
Here, you take it. You take
on the responsibility.

430
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,705
I'll just... I'll keep my
mouth shut. That's all.

431
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,791
What are you getting so hot about?
Calm down, will you?

432
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:39,209
Don't tell me to calm down.

433
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,419
Here. You wanna take the chair,
just take the chair. That's all.

434
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,963
- Did you ever see such a thing?
- See if you can keep it running.

435
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,219
Listen, you think it's
funny or something?

436
00:23:45,245 --> 00:23:47,675
Hey, forget it, fella. The whole
thing's unimportant. Come on.

437
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:50,887
- Unimportant? Oh, here, you try it.
- No, nobody wants to change.

438
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,722
You're doing a beautiful job.
Sit down.

439
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:55,642
Yeah, you're doing great.
Just great, fella.

440
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:57,619
You stay in there and
pitch. You know?

441
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,788
All right. Let's hear
from somebody.

442
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:06,361
Well, if you want me to tell you how
I feel about it, it's all right with me.

443
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,571
Boy, I don't care what you do.

444
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,533
All right, I don't have
anything brilliant.

445
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:13,743
I only know as much as you do.

446
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:17,580
According to the testimony,
the boy looks guilty. Maybe he is.

447
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:21,851
I sat there in court for six days
listening while the evidence built up.

448
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,170
Everybody sounded so
positive, you know?

449
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,714
I-I began to get a peculiar
feeling about this trial.

450
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,883
I mean, nothing is that positive.

451
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,094
There are a lot of questions
I'd have liked to ask.

452
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:33,888
I don't know. Maybe they wouldn't
have meant anything, but...

453
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,932
I began to get the feeling
that the defense counsel...

454
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:38,518
wasn't conducting a thorough-enough
cross-examination.

455
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:41,980
I mean, he... he let too many
things go by, little things that...

456
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,816
What little things? Listen, when
these fellas don't ask questions...

457
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:47,402
it's because they know the answers
already and they figure they'll be hurt.

458
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:51,406
Maybe it's also possible for a lawyer
to be just plain stupid, isn't it?

459
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:52,782
I mean it's possible.

460
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,584
You sound like you met
my brother-in-law once.

461
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:00,348
I... I kept putting myself
in the kid's place.

462
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,294
I'd have asked for
another lawyer, I think.

463
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:06,921
I mean, if I was on
trial for my life...

464
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:11,801
I'd want my lawyer to tear the prosecution
witnesses to shreds, or at least try to.

465
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:15,863
Look, there was one alleged
eyewitness to this killing.

466
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:19,767
Someone else claims he heard the killing,
saw the boy run out afterwards.

467
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,978
And there was a lot of
circumstantial evidence.

468
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:25,565
But actually, those two witnesses were
the entire case for the prosecution.

469
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,442
Supposing they're wrong.

470
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,319
What do you mean
supposing they're wrong?

471
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,279
What's the point of
having witnesses at all?

472
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,990
- Could they be wrong?
- What are you trying to say?

473
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:35,617
Those people sat on
the stand under oath.

474
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:37,243
They're only people.
People make mistakes.

475
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,053
Could they be wrong?

476
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:42,749
- Well, no, I don't think so.
- Do you know so?

477
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,667
Oh, come on. Nobody can
know a thing like that.

478
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,461
This isn't an exact science.

479
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:47,895
That's right. It isn't.

480
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,803
Okay, let...
Let's get to the point.

481
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,473
What about the switch knife they
found in the old man's chest?

482
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,975
Uh, wait-wait a minute. There's
some people who haven't talked yet.

483
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,061
- Shouldn't we go in order?
- They'll get a chance to talk.

484
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,480
Be quiet a second, will you?

485
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:06,856
What about it, this...

486
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:10,401
the knife this fine upright boy admitted
buying the night of the killing?

487
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,819
Let's talk about it.

488
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,155
All right, let's talk about it.
Let's get it in here and look at it.

489
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:15,990
I'd like to see it again.
Mr. Foreman?

490
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:19,160
We all saw what it looks like.
Why do we have to see it again?

491
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:21,281
The gentleman has a right
to see exhibits in evidence.

492
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:24,874
Say, could you bring us the knife?

493
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,768
- Knife?
- Yeah. Thank you.

494
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:31,673
The knife and the way it was bought is
pretty strong evidence, don't you think?

495
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:33,424
- I do.
- Good.

496
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,010
Now, suppose we take these
facts one at a time.

497
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:39,347
One. The boy admitted going out of the
house at 8:00 on the night of the murder...

498
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:41,349
after being slapped several
times by his father.

499
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:44,185
No, no. No, he didn't say
"slapped." He said "punched."

500
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:46,688
There's a difference between
a slap and a punch.

501
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:49,357
After being hit several
times by his father.

502
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:51,693
Two. He went directly to a
neighborhood junk shop...

503
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:53,903
- where he bought one of those...
- Switch knives.

504
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,989
Switchblade knives.

505
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,865
This wasn't what you'd
call an ordinary knife.

506
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,451
It had a very unusual
carved handle and blade.

507
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,036
The storekeeper who
sold it to him...

508
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:05,248
said it was the only one of its
kind he had ever had in stock.

509
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:09,085
Three. He met some friends of his
in front of a tavern about 8:45.

510
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:10,670
Am I right so far?

511
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:12,880
- Yes, you are.
- You bet he is.

512
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:16,134
He talked with his friends for about
an hour, leaving them at 9:45.

513
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:19,178
During this time,
they saw the switch knife.

514
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,055
Four.

515
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,558
They identified the death
weapon in court...

516
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:26,144
as that very same knife.

517
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:29,022
Five. He arrived
home at about 10:00.

518
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:31,441
Now this is where the stories
offered by the State and the boy...

519
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:33,443
begin to diverge slightly.

520
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:36,112
He claims that he went to
a movie at about 11:30...

521
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:40,241
returning home at 3:10 to find his
father dead and himself arrested.

522
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:42,368
He also claims that the two
detectives who arrested him...

523
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,746
threw him down a half
a flight of stairs.

524
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:46,664
Now, what happened
to the switch knife?

525
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,375
He claims that it fell through a hole in
his pocket on the way to the movies...

526
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:54,130
sometime between 11:30 and 3:10
and that he never saw it again.

527
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:56,174
Now there's a tale, gentlemen.

528
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:59,761
I think it's quite clear that the boy
never went to the movies that night.

529
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:01,804
No one in the house saw
him go out at 11:30.

530
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,389
No one at the theater
identified him.

531
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,710
He couldn't even remember the
names of the pictures he saw.

532
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:10,355
- What actually happened is this.
- Thank you.

533
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:13,649
The boy stayed home, had another
fight with his father...

534
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,445
stabbed him to death and left the
house at 10 minutes after 12:00.

535
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:20,281
He even remembered to wipe the
knife clean of fingerprints.

536
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:22,992
Now are you trying to tell
me that this knife...

537
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:24,994
really fell through a hole
in the boy's pocket...

538
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:27,455
someone picked it up off the street,
went to the boy's house...

539
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:30,208
and stabbed his father with it
just to test its sharpness?

540
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,293
No. I'm just saying it's possible
the boy lost his knife...

541
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,587
and that somebody else stabbed
his father with a similar knife.

542
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:35,880
It's just possible.

543
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,565
Take a look at this knife.

544
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,677
It's a very unusual knife.

545
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,304
I've never seen one like it.

546
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:46,182
Neither had the storekeeper
who sold it to the boy.

547
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:49,227
Aren't you asking us to accept
a pretty incredible coincidence?

548
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,646
I'm just saying a
coincidence is possible.

549
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,247
And I say it's not possible.

550
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,572
Where did that come from?

551
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,032
- Where'd you get that?
- It's the same knife.

552
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,617
What do you think you're doing?

553
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,327
Where did you get it?

554
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,663
I went out walking for a
couple of hours last night.

555
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:10,748
I walked through the
boy's neighborhood.

556
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,835
I bought that at a little pawnshop
just two blocks from the boy's house.

557
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:15,378
It cost six dollars.

558
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:18,589
It's against the law to buy
or sell switchblade knives.

559
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,925
That's right. I broke the law.

560
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:25,012
Listen, you pulled a real bright trick.
Now, supposing you tell me what it proves.

561
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,181
Maybe there are 10
knives like that. So what?

562
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,059
- Maybe there are.
- Well, what does it mean?

563
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,438
You found another knife like it. What's that,
the discovery of the age or something?

564
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,857
You mean you're asking us to believe
that somebody else did the stabbing...

565
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:37,733
with exactly the
same kind of knife?

566
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,068
The odds are a million-to-one.

567
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:41,879
- It's possible.
- But not very probable.

568
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,074
Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.

569
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:47,236
There's no point in standing
around all over the place.

570
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:52,248
You know, it's interesting that he'd find a
knife exactly like the one the boy bought.

571
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:55,084
What's interesting about it?
"Interesting."

572
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:57,044
Well, I don't know. I just
thought it was interesting.

573
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,921
There are still 11 of us
here who think he's guilty.

574
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,299
Right. What do you think
you're gonna accomplish?

575
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,217
You're not gonna
change anybody's mind.

576
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,678
So if you wanna be stubborn
and hang this jury, go ahead.

577
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,823
The kid will be tried again and
found guilty sure as he's born.

578
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,226
That's probably right.

579
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,521
So what are you gonna do?
You know, we could be here all night.

580
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:18,858
It's only one night.
A boy may die.

581
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:21,486
Well, why don't we just
set up house here, huh?

582
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:24,030
Someone send for Potsy the
policeman and get a pinochle deck...

583
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:26,616
and, uh, we'll just sweat the
whole thing out right here.

584
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:31,162
- I don't think he ought to joke about it.
- What do you want me to do about it?

585
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:34,916
Oh, listen! I don't see what all this stuff
about the knife's got to do with anything.

586
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:37,919
Somebody saw the kid stab his father.
What more do we need?

587
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,796
You guys can talk the ears right
off my head. You know what I mean?

588
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:43,591
I got three garages of mine goin'
to pot while you're talking.

589
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:45,343
So let's get done
and get outta here.

590
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:48,846
The knife was very important to the
district attorney. He spent a whole day...

591
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,390
He's a 15th assistant or something.
What does he know about it?

592
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,934
Hey, let's hold it down.

593
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:55,369
These side arguments
are only slowing us up.

594
00:30:58,148 --> 00:30:59,607
Well, what about it?

595
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,208
You're the only one.

596
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,177
I have a proposition
to make to all of you.

597
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:14,013
I'm gonna call for another vote.

598
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:20,670
I want you 11 men to vote
by secret written ballot.

599
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:22,797
I'll abstain.

600
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,675
If there are 11 votes for guilty,
I won't stand alone.

601
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:29,570
We'll take in a guilty verdict
to the judge right now.

602
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:34,742
But if anyone votes not guilty,
we stay here and talk it out.

603
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,982
Well, that's it. If you
want to try it, I'm ready.

604
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:42,525
All right.
Let's do it the hard way.

605
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:44,527
Okay, that sounds fair.
Everyone agreed?

606
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,696
- Anyone doesn't agree?
- Fine, fine. Let's go.

607
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:47,822
Here, pass these along.

608
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,674
Is that the right time?

609
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:22,915
"Guilty."

610
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,752
"Guilty."

611
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,172
"Guilty."

612
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:33,676
"Guilty."

613
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,345
"Guilty."

614
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:39,432
"Guilty."

615
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,768
"Guilty."

616
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:45,104
"Guilty."

617
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:47,565
"Guilty."

618
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:54,263
"Not guilty."

619
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:55,765
"Guilty."

620
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:57,516
Boy, how do you like that?

621
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,061
Oh, and another chap
flaps his wings.

622
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:02,897
All right, who was it?
Come on. I want to know.

623
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,232
Excuse me.
This was a secret ballot.

624
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,859
We all agreed on that, no?

625
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,070
If the gentleman wanted
to remain secret...

626
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:11,030
Secret? What do you mean secret?

627
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:14,341
There are no secrets in a
jury room. I know who it was.

628
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,994
Brother, you really are something.

629
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,080
You sit here, vote guilty
like the rest of us...

630
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:22,458
and then some golden-voiced preacher
starts tearin' your poor heart out...

631
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:25,836
about some underprivileged kid just
couldn't help becomin' a murderer...

632
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,421
and you change your vote.

633
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,632
If that isn't the most sick...

634
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:33,386
Why don't you drop a quarter
in his collection box?

635
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:35,429
Oh, now just wait a minute.

636
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,098
Listen, you can't talk
to me like that.

637
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:39,016
- No. Who do you think you are?
- Calm down. Calm down.

638
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,435
No. Who does he think he is?
Did you hear him?

639
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,850
It doesn't matter. He's
very excitable. Sit down.

640
00:33:42,876 --> 00:33:44,780
Excitable? You bet I'm excitable!

641
00:33:44,781 --> 00:33:47,700
We're trying to put a guilty man
in the chair where he belongs!

642
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,653
Someone starts telling us fairy
tales, and we're listenin'!

643
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:52,488
Hey, uh, come on, huh?

644
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:54,490
What made you change your vote?

645
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,200
He didn't change his vote.

646
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:57,451
I did.

647
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,495
- Oh, fine.
- I knew it.

648
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,539
Would you like me to tell you why?

649
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,499
No, I wouldn't like
you to tell me why.

650
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,127
I'd like to make it clear
anyway, if you don't mind.

651
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:07,712
Do we have to listen to this?

652
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:09,547
The man wants to talk.

653
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:11,215
Thank you.

654
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:14,635
This gentleman has been
standing alone against us.

655
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,971
Now, he doesn't say
the boy is not guilty.

656
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:19,014
He just isn't sure.

657
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,934
Well, it's not easy to stand alone
against the ridicule of others.

658
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:25,146
So he gambled for support,
and I gave it to him.

659
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:26,939
I respect his motives.

660
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,569
The boy on trial is probably guilty,
but, uh, I want to hear more.

661
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,446
Right now, the vote is 10 to two.

662
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:35,781
I'm talking here! You have
no right to leave this room!

663
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,742
He can't hear you. He never will.

664
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:39,426
Let's sit down.

665
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,791
Shall we continue?

666
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,085
Well, I... I think we
ought to take a break.

667
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:52,298
You know, one man's inside,
and I think we ought to wait for him.

668
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:55,342
Okay.

669
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,194
Looks like we're really
hung up here, huh?

670
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:00,906
And that thing with the old man,
that was pretty unexpected.

671
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:05,452
I wish I could figure out some
way we could break it up.

672
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:12,026
You know, in advertising...
I told you I worked in an agency.

673
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,110
Mm-hmm.

674
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,196
Well, there's some pretty
strange people working there.

675
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:17,364
Well, they're not strange
really, I guess.

676
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,075
It's just that they have peculiar
ways of expressing themselves.

677
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,410
You know what I mean.

678
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,811
Of course, I suppose it's the same
in your business too, huh?

679
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,956
What do you do?

680
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,209
- I'm a watchmaker.
- Oh, really?

681
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:31,504
Well, I imagine the finest watchmakers
in the world come from Europe, huh?

682
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:34,590
Anyway, as I was telling you, in an agency,
when we reach a point like this...

683
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:38,177
I'm telling him about, in an ad agency, when
a point like this is reached in a meeting...

684
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:40,888
there's always some character
ready with an idea, see.

685
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,932
And it kills me.

686
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:44,517
It's the weirdest
thing in the world...

687
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:47,937
the way they sometimes precede their
idea with a little phrase, see, like...

688
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:50,940
Some account exec will
get up, and he'll say, uh...

689
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:52,858
"Okay, here's an idea.

690
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:56,570
Let's, uh, run it up the flagpole
and see if anyone salutes it."

691
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,782
I mean, it's idiotic,
but it's funny, huh?

692
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:04,386
I, uh... I got a little
excited back there. I...

693
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,139
didn't mean to get nasty.

694
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:11,810
I'm glad you're not one of those lets
these emotional appeals influence him.

695
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,230
Uh...

696
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:31,395
I don't know what's the matter with
that fan. Can't seem to get it to start.

697
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,797
Eh!

698
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:43,117
Hey, you a salesman?

699
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:44,718
I'm an architect.

700
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,871
Hmm.

701
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:49,223
You know what the soft sell is?

702
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,061
Boy, you got it. Believe me.

703
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,439
I got a different technique.

704
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:00,009
Laughs, drinks, jokes.

705
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,361
Tricks. You know?

706
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:04,405
Yeah.

707
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,075
"Hit 'em where they live."
That's my motto.

708
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:12,246
I made 27 grand last
year sellin' marmalade.

709
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,582
That's not bad. I mean,
you know, considering marmalade.

710
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:20,587
Hey, what are you gettin'
outta this... kicks?

711
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,326
Or did somebody bump you on the head one
time and you haven't gotten over it?

712
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:27,136
Maybe.

713
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:30,664
You know, you do-gooders
are all alike.

714
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:33,434
You're always blowing your stacks
over some guy that fanned.

715
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,355
But what are you
wasting our time for?

716
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:43,152
Why don't you donate five dollars to the
cause, and maybe it'll make you feel better.

717
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:48,682
This kid is guilty, pal.

718
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,185
It's as plain as the
nose on your face.

719
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:53,520
So why don't we stop
wasting our time here?

720
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,523
We're gonna all get sore throats
if we keep it up, you know?

721
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:59,205
What difference does it make if you
get it here or at the ball game?

722
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:02,863
Oh, no difference, pal.

723
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,757
No difference at all.

724
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,545
Nice bunch of guys, huh?

725
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,923
Oh, they're about the
same as anyone else.

726
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:23,817
Phew! Boy, what a murderous day.

727
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,845
You think we'll be much longer?

728
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,555
I don't know.

729
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,557
Aw, he's guilty for sure.

730
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,184
Not a doubt in the whole world.

731
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,828
We should...
Should've been done already.

732
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,315
Oh, I don't mind, you know.

733
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,834
Hmm. Beats workin'.

734
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:45,672
Uh...

735
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:50,119
You think he's not guilty, huh?

736
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,054
I don't know. It's possible.

737
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:56,583
Well, I don't know you, but I'm bettin'
you never been wronger in your life.

738
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,086
You're wasting your time.
You ought to wrap it up.

739
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:01,355
Supposing you were the
one who was on trial.

740
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,049
Well, I'm not used to supposing.

741
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:08,637
I'm just a workingman. My boss
does the supposing. But...

742
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:10,239
Well, I'll try one.

743
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:17,121
Supposing you talk us all out of this, and,
the kid really did knife his father. Huh?

744
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,322
Are you ready?

745
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,615
Hup.

746
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:29,616
That one.

747
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,385
Sorry, blue eyes.

748
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,370
- Well, where else...
- Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.

749
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,706
- Well, where else...
- Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.

750
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,708
Looks like we'll be
here for dinner, huh?

751
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:40,169
Okay, now let's...
Let's get down to business.

752
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,628
Now, who wants to start it off?

753
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,130
- I would.
- Okay, go.

754
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,299
You down there.

755
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,261
The old man who lived downstairs says he
heard the kid yell out, "I'm gonna kill ya."

756
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:51,972
A second later, he heard
the body hit the floor.

757
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:55,934
Now, he ran to the door and he saw the kid
running down the stairs and out of the house.

758
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,394
What does that mean to you?

759
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,048
I was wondering how
clearly the old man could

760
00:39:59,049 --> 00:40:00,856
have heard the boy's voice
through the ceiling.

761
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,983
He didn't hear it through the ceiling.
The window was open.

762
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:04,902
So was the one upstairs.
It was a hot night, remember?

763
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:06,320
Well, it was another apartment.

764
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:08,989
It's not that easy to identify a voice,
particularly a shouting voice.

765
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,657
- He identified it in court.
- That's right.

766
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,201
And don't forget the
lady across the street.

767
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:15,079
She looked right in the open window
and saw the boy stab his father.

768
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,623
- Now, I mean, isn't that enough for you?
- No, it isn't.

769
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:19,666
Boy, how do you like this guy, huh?

770
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,585
It's like talking
into a dead phone.

771
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:24,838
She said she saw the killing through
the windows of a moving elevated train.

772
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:28,425
There were six cars on the train. She saw
the killing through the last two cars.

773
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,344
She remembered the most
insignificant details.

774
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,471
I don't see how you
can argue with that.

775
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:37,117
Has anybody here any idea
how long it would take an el...

776
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,361
Hey!

777
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,962
This isn't a game.

778
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,494
- Did you see him?
- Hey.

779
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:57,329
- The nerve.
- All right, listen...

780
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:00,666
- The absolute nerve.
- Forget it. It's not important.

781
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,709
- "This isn't a game"?
- Calm down.

782
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:06,130
- Who does he think he is?
- I'm telling you, forget it now.

783
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:09,550
Has anybody any idea how long
it takes an elevated train...

784
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:11,468
going at medium speed
to pass a given point?

785
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,428
- What has that to do with anything?
- How long? Take a guess.

786
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:16,181
- I wouldn't have the slightest idea.
- What do you think?

787
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,158
I don't know. Maybe 10, 12 seconds?

788
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,811
I think that's a pretty
good guess. Anyone else?

789
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:23,689
- That sounds right to me.
- Come on. What's the guessing game for?

790
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,607
- What do you say?
- Ten seconds is about right.

791
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,609
All right. Say 10 seconds.
What are you getting at?

792
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:32,739
This. It takes a six-car el train
10 seconds to pass a given point.

793
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,075
Now let's say the given
point is the open window

794
00:41:35,101 --> 00:41:37,077
of the room where the
killing took place.

795
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:40,455
You can reach out of that window
and almost touch the el tracks, right?

796
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,040
Now let me ask you this.

797
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,376
Has anyone here ever lived
near the el tracks?

798
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:48,088
Well, uh, I just finished painting an
apartment that overlooked an el line.

799
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:49,840
- I was there for three days.
- What was it like?

800
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,091
- What do you mean?
- Noisy?

801
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:53,719
Oh, brother. Don't matter though.
We were all punchy.

802
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,388
I lived in a second-floor
apartment near the el line once.

803
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:59,533
When the window was open and the train
goes by, the noise is almost unbearable.

804
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:00,685
You can hardly hear yourself think.

805
00:42:00,711 --> 00:42:02,436
All right, you can't
hear yourself think.

806
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,938
- Will you get to the point?
- I will. Now just a minute.

807
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:08,650
Let's take two pieces of testimony
and try to put them together.

808
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:12,821
First. The old man in the
apartment downstairs.

809
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:15,490
He says he heard the boy say
"I'm gonna kill you"...

810
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:18,327
and a split second later
heard a body hit the floor.

811
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:19,995
- One second later, right?
- That's right.

812
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:26,084
Second. The woman across the street swore
positively she looked out of the window...

813
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:29,504
and saw the killing through the last two
cars of the passing elevated train, right?

814
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,924
- The last two cars.
- What are you giving us here?

815
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:33,342
Now, just a minute.

816
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:37,863
We've agreed that it takes 10 seconds
for a train to pass a given point.

817
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:42,017
Since the woman saw the killing
through the last two cars...

818
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:47,064
we can assume that the body hit the
floor just as the train went by.

819
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:51,610
Therefore, the train had been
roaring by the old man's window...

820
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:55,197
a full 10 seconds before
the body hit the floor.

821
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:57,491
The old man, according
to his own testimony...

822
00:42:57,492 --> 00:43:00,494
"I'm gonna kill you," body hitting
the floor a split second later...

823
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:03,038
would have had to hear the
boy make this statement...

824
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,998
with the el roaring past his nose.

825
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,625
It's not possible he
could've heard it.

826
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:08,877
- That's idiotic. Of course he heard it.
- Do you think he could've heard it?

827
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:11,338
He said he yelled at the top of his
voice. That's good enough for me.

828
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,674
Even if he heard something, he still
couldn't have identified the voice.

829
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:14,883
With the el roaring by?

830
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:17,344
You're talking about a matter of seconds!
Nobody can be that accurate.

831
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:22,057
I think testimony that could put a boy into
the electric chair should be that accurate.

832
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:26,186
You know something? I don't
think he could've heard it.

833
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:28,605
Maybe he didn't hear it.
I mean, with all that el noise.

834
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,565
Oh, what are you
people talking about?

835
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,693
Well, it stands to reason
he couldn't have heard it.

836
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:34,695
Why should he lie?
What's he got to gain?

837
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:36,989
Attention maybe.

838
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,991
You keep coming in with
these bright sayings!

839
00:43:38,992 --> 00:43:42,119
Why don't you send 'em in to a paper?
They pay three dollars apiece.

840
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,429
What are you talking
to him like that for?

841
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,792
Guy talks like that to an old man really
ought to get stepped on, you know?

842
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,727
You ought to have
more respect, mister.

843
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:56,316
If you say stuff like that to him
again, I'm gonna lay you out.

844
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:09,229
Now you go ahead. You...
You say anything you like.

845
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:13,358
Why do you think the
old man might lie?

846
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,878
It was just that I looked at
him for a very long time.

847
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:20,741
The seams of his jacket was split,
under the shoulder.

848
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:22,409
Or did you notice that?

849
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,995
I mean, to come to court like that.

850
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:26,763
Why...

851
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:31,752
He was a very old man
in a torn jacket.

852
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:34,729
And he walked very
slowly to the stand.

853
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:39,509
He was dragging his left leg
and trying to hide it...

854
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,278
because he was ashamed.

855
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:45,824
I think I know this man
better than anyone here.

856
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:52,105
This is a quiet, frightened,
insignificant old man who...

857
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,566
who has been nothing
all his life...

858
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:57,069
who has never had recognition...

859
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,254
or his name in the newspapers.

860
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:02,115
Nobody knows him.

861
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,242
Nobody quotes him.

862
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:08,305
Nobody seeks his
advice after 75 years.

863
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,018
Gentlemen, that's a very
sad thing... to be nothing.

864
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:18,064
A man like this needs to be
quoted, to be listened to.

865
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:20,634
To be quoted just once.

866
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:22,611
Very important to him.

867
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:25,514
It would be so hard for him to
recede into the background...

868
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:27,307
- Wait a minute.
- When there was a chance...

869
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:30,268
What are you trying to do... tell us he'd
lie just so he could be important once?

870
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,979
No. He wouldn't really lie.

871
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,525
But perhaps he made himself
believe he heard those words...

872
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:38,819
and recognized the boy's face.

873
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,196
That's the most fantastic
story I've ever heard.

874
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:44,341
How can you make up a thing like that?
What do you know about it?

875
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:55,419
Oh, uh, does anybody
want a cough drop?

876
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,754
- No, thanks.
- I'll take one.

877
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,156
You can say what you like.

878
00:45:59,157 --> 00:46:01,341
I still don't see how anybody
can think he's not guilty.

879
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:03,927
There's something else I'd like
to talk about for a minute.

880
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,637
Thanks.

881
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:09,015
I think we've proved that the old man couldn't
have heard the boy say "I'm gonna kill you."

882
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,684
- But supposing...
- You didn't prove it at all.

883
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:13,562
- What are you talking about?
- Supposing he really did hear it.

884
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:16,064
This phrase, how many times
have all of us used it?

885
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:17,649
Probably thousands.

886
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,359
"I could kill you
for that, darling."

887
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,361
"Junior, you do that once more,
and I'm gonna kill you."

888
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:22,737
"Get in there, Rocky,
and kill him."

889
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,698
We say it every day. That doesn't
mean we're really gonna kill anybody.

890
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:26,575
Wait a minute. What are you
trying to give us here?

891
00:46:26,576 --> 00:46:30,370
The phrase was "I'm gonna kill you."
The kid yelled it at the top of his lungs.

892
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:31,788
Don't tell me he didn't mean it.

893
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,166
Anybody says a thing like that
the way he said it, they mean it.

894
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:35,709
Well, gee, now I don't know.

895
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:40,505
I remember I was arguing with a guy I work
next to at the bank a couple weeks ago.

896
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,340
He called me an idiot,
so I yelled at him.

897
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:45,385
Now listen! This guy's trying to make
you believe things that aren't so.

898
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:47,554
The kid said he was gonna
kill him, and he did kill him.

899
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:50,599
Let me ask you this. Do you really think the
boy would shout out a thing like that...

900
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,476
so the whole neighborhood
could hear him?

901
00:46:52,477 --> 00:46:54,394
I don't think so.
He's much too bright for that.

902
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:59,232
Bright? He's a common ignorant slob.
He don't even speak good English.

903
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:02,168
"He doesn't even
speak good English."

904
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:08,408
Mr. Foreman, I'd like to
change my vote to not guilty.

905
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:09,910
You what?

906
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:12,429
- You heard me.
- Are you sure?

907
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,748
Yeah, I'm sure.

908
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:17,292
The vote is nine to three,
favor of guilty.

909
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:20,186
Well, if this isn't
the living end. Huh?

910
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:26,985
What are you basing it on...
the stories this guy made up?

911
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,930
You ought to write for one of
those kooky detective magazines.

912
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:31,848
You'd make a fortune.

913
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:35,368
For crying out loud. The kid's own
lawyer knew he didn't stand a chance.

914
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,437
Right from the beginning,
his own lawyer knew it.

915
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:39,314
You could see it.

916
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:43,001
Boy, oh, boy. I'm tellin' you,
this guy here is really something.

917
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:45,612
Look, the kid had a
lawyer, didn't he?

918
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:48,532
He presented his case, not you.
How come you got so much to say?

919
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:51,451
- Look, lawyers aren't infallible, you know.
- Baltimore, please. Huh?

920
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:53,245
He was court-appointed.

921
00:47:53,246 --> 00:47:55,163
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It could mean a lot of things.

922
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:58,500
It could mean he didn't want the case,
or he resented being appointed.

923
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:00,418
It's the kind of case that
brings him nothing...

924
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:03,463
no money, no glory, not even
much chance of winning.

925
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:06,466
That's not a very promising
situation for a young lawyer.

926
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:09,469
He'd really have to believe in his client
to put up any kind of a good case...

927
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,555
and, as you pointed out a minute
ago, obviously he didn't.

928
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:14,474
Of course he didn't. Huh.

929
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:16,851
Who the heck could?

930
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:19,854
Except maybe some guy's
mother or somebody. I...

931
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,190
Ah, look. Will you
look at the time, huh?

932
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:24,818
- Come on. For crying out...
- Pardon me.

933
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:27,237
- I have made some notes here...
- Notes.

934
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:29,948
And I would like to...
please, to say something.

935
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:32,284
- Yeah.
- I have been listening very carefully.

936
00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:36,788
And, uh, it seems to me that this man
has some very good points to make.

937
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:41,501
From what was presented at the trial,
the boy looks guilty on the surface.

938
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:45,672
- But maybe if we go deeper?
- Oh, come on, will ya?

939
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:48,049
There is a question I
would like to ask.

940
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:51,428
Let us assume that the boy
really did commit the murder.

941
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:54,848
Now, this happened at
10 minutes after 12:00.

942
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:57,392
Now, how was he
caught by the police?

943
00:48:57,393 --> 00:49:01,980
He came back home,
uh, at 3:00 or so...

944
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:05,817
and he was captured by two detectives
in the hallway of his house.

945
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:10,488
Now, my question is, if he
really had killed his father...

946
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:13,783
why would he come back
home three hours later?

947
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,745
Wouldn't he be afraid
of being caught?

948
00:49:16,746 --> 00:49:18,580
He came home to get his knife.

949
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:21,207
It's not nice to go around leaving
knives sticking in people's chests.

950
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:24,044
- Yeah, especially relatives.
- Yeah.

951
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:26,379
I don't see
anything funny about it.

952
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:30,008
The boy knew the knife could be
identified as the one he had just bought.

953
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:32,260
He had to get it
before the police did.

954
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:34,542
But if he knew the knife
could be identified,

955
00:49:34,568 --> 00:49:36,848
why did he leave it there
in the first place?

956
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:40,226
Well, I think we can assume the boy
ran out in a state of panic...

957
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,687
after having just
killed his father.

958
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:45,732
When he finally calmed down,
he realized he had left his knife there.

959
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:48,735
Ah. This then depends on
your definition of panic.

960
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:51,196
He would have had to be
calm enough to see to it...

961
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:53,865
that there were no fingerprints
left on the knife.

962
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:57,994
Now, where did this panic
start and where did it end?

963
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,455
Look, you voted guilty.
What side are ya on?

964
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:04,084
I don't believe I have to be
loyal to one side or the other.

965
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:05,960
I'm simply asking questions.

966
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:09,047
Well, this is just off the
top of my head, but, uh...

967
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:11,633
well, if I were the boy and I'd
done the stabbing and everything...

968
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:13,843
I'd take a chance and
go back for the knife.

969
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,429
I'll bet he figured that nobody
had seen him running out...

970
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,015
and that the body wouldn't be
discovered till the next day.

971
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,142
Well, after all, it was
the middle of the night.

972
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:23,728
I'll bet he'd figured nobody would
find the body till the next day.

973
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,814
Pardon. This is my whole point.

974
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:29,609
The woman across the street testified that
the moment after she saw the killing...

975
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:32,278
that is, a moment after
the train went by...

976
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:35,365
she screamed and then went
to telephone the police.

977
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:38,827
Now, the boy certainly must
have heard the scream...

978
00:50:38,828 --> 00:50:42,414
so he knew that
somebody saw something.

979
00:50:42,415 --> 00:50:45,291
I just don't think that
he would have gone back.

980
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:48,128
Two things. One, in his state of panic,
he may not have heard the scream.

981
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:49,879
Perhaps it wasn't very loud.

982
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,341
Two, if he did hear it, he may not
have connected it with his own act.

983
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:56,469
Remember, he lived in a neighborhood
where screams were fairly commonplace.

984
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:59,013
- There's your answer.
- Maybe.

985
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,975
Maybe the boy did kill his father,
didn't hear the scream...

986
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:05,770
did run out in a panic,
did calm down three hours later...

987
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,481
and come back to get the knife,
risking being caught by the police.

988
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:11,484
Maybe all of those things happened,
but maybe they didn't.

989
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:14,320
I think there's enough doubt that we can
wonder whether he was there at all...

990
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,072
during the time the
killing took place.

991
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,907
What do you mean doubt?
What are you talking about?

992
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,701
Didn't the old man see him
running out of the house?

993
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:21,578
He's twisting the facts,
I'm telling you.

994
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:24,998
Did or didn't the old man see the kid
running out of the house at 12:10?

995
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:27,000
Well, did or didn't he?

996
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:30,295
- He says he did.
- "Says he did"? Boy! How do you like that?

997
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:33,339
- Now, look, witnesses can make mistakes.
- Sure, when you want them to, they do.

998
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,675
Or when he wants them to, they do.
You know what I mean?

999
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:37,594
- Keep the yelling down!
- Oh, you keep saying that.

1000
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:39,387
Maybe what we need
is a little yelling in here.

1001
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:41,181
These guys keep going
off every which way.

1002
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:43,183
Did hear the scream.
Didn't hear the scream.

1003
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:46,436
What difference does it make? You people
are talking only about the little details.

1004
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:49,022
You're forgetting the important stuff.
I mean, all of a sudden, everybody here...

1005
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:51,483
- I want to call for another vote.
- I'm talking here!

1006
00:51:51,484 --> 00:51:55,253
There's another vote called for.
Now let's take our seats.

1007
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:01,659
I never saw so much
time spent on nothing.

1008
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,469
It only takes a second.

1009
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:07,957
Okay. I guess the fastest way is to
find out who's voting not guilty.

1010
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,810
Now, all those voting not guilty,
please raise your hands.

1011
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:15,632
Still the same. One, two,
three not guilty. Nine guilty.

1012
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:17,383
So, now where are we?

1013
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:20,887
I'm telling you, we can yackety-yack until
next Tuesday. Where's it all getting us?

1014
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:23,723
Pardon. I vote not guilty.

1015
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:26,810
Oh!

1016
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:30,188
What are ya talking about? I mean, we're
all going crazy in here or something.

1017
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:34,067
The kid is guilty. Why don't
you listen to the facts?

1018
00:52:34,068 --> 00:52:36,402
Tell him, will ya? Now this
is getting to be a joke.

1019
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:39,697
The vote is eight to four,
favor of guilty.

1020
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:43,451
What is this, love your underprivileged
brother week or something?

1021
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:46,037
I want you to get up and tell me
why you changed your vote.

1022
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:50,416
- Come on. Give me your reasons.
- I don't have to defend my decision to you.

1023
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,252
There is a reasonable
doubt in my mind.

1024
00:52:52,253 --> 00:52:55,338
What reasonable doubt? That's nothing
but words. Here, look at this.

1025
00:52:55,339 --> 00:53:00,343
The kid you just decided isn't guilty
was seen ramming this into his father.

1026
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:02,428
Now, what about this,
Mr. Reasonable Doubt?

1027
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,181
That's not the knife.
Don't you remember?

1028
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,433
Oh, brilliant.

1029
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,811
I'm telling ya,
this is the craziest.

1030
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:12,063
I mean, what are we
supposed to believe?

1031
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:14,983
I mean, you're sittin' here, you're pulling
stories out of thin air, you know?

1032
00:53:14,984 --> 00:53:18,778
A guy like this, if he's, uh, sitting
ringside at the Dempsey-Firpo fight...

1033
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:21,322
he'd be trying to
tell you that, uh...

1034
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:23,783
Look. Now, what about the old man?

1035
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:26,452
Are we supposed to believe that he
didn't get up and run to his door...

1036
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:29,539
and see the kid tearing down the
steps 15 seconds after the killing?

1037
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,083
He's just saying so to
be important, right?

1038
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:33,644
I mean, what's the point
of the whole thing?

1039
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:34,961
Wait. Hold it a
second, will you?

1040
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:37,255
Oh, and the Baltimore rooter
is heard from again now...

1041
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:39,299
and pop-ups are fallin' for
base hits wherever we look.

1042
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,635
Hold it a second. Now, look... Did
the old man say he ran to the door?

1043
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:44,555
Ran, walked. What's the difference?
He got on, didn't he?

1044
00:53:44,581 --> 00:53:45,680
I mean, he got there, didn't he?

1045
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:48,308
- No, now wait a second.
- He said he ran. At least I think he did.

1046
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:51,811
Look, I don't remember what he said, but I
don't see how he could have run to the door.

1047
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:54,272
He said he went from his
bedroom to the front door.

1048
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:55,982
- Now, isn't that enough?
- Where was the bedroom?

1049
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:58,318
- It was down the hall somewhere.
- I thought you remembered everything.

1050
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,653
- Don't you remember that?
- No.

1051
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,964
Mr. Foreman, I'd like to see
a diagram of the apartment.

1052
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:05,558
Why don't we just have 'em run the trial all
over again so you can get everything straight?

1053
00:54:05,559 --> 00:54:06,284
Mr. Foreman.

1054
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:08,995
How come you're the only one in this
room wants to see exhibits all the time?

1055
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:11,789
- I want to see this one too.
- And I'd like to stop wasting time.

1056
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,709
If we're gonna start wading through all that
nonsense about where the body was found...

1057
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:16,753
We're not, not unless
somebody else wants to.

1058
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:18,546
But I'd like to find
out if an old man...

1059
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:21,007
who drags one foot when he walks
'cause he had a stroke last year...

1060
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:23,509
can get from his bedroom to
his front door in 15 seconds.

1061
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,261
- He said 20 seconds.
- He said 15.

1062
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:27,513
He said 20 seconds. What are
you trying to distort...

1063
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:30,850
- He said 15.
- How does he know how long 15 seconds is?

1064
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:32,602
You can't judge a thing like that.

1065
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:35,063
He said 15 seconds.
He was very positive about it.

1066
00:54:35,064 --> 00:54:37,357
He was an old man.
Half the time he was confused.

1067
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:39,751
How could he be positive
about anything?

1068
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:49,529
I don't see what you're
going to prove here.

1069
00:54:49,555 --> 00:54:51,537
The man said he saw
the boy running out.

1070
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,790
Well, let's see if the
details bear him out.

1071
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,751
As soon as the body hit the floor,
he said he heard footsteps upstairs...

1072
00:54:56,752 --> 00:54:58,503
running toward the front door...

1073
00:54:58,504 --> 00:55:01,673
heard the upstairs door open,
the footsteps start down the stairs.

1074
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:03,883
He said he got to his own front
door as fast as he could...

1075
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:06,052
and he swore it couldn't have
been more than 15 seconds.

1076
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:07,804
Now, if the killer began
running immediately...

1077
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:10,098
- Maybe he didn't.
- The old man said he did.

1078
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:12,892
You ought to be at Atlantic City
at that hairsplitters convention.

1079
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:16,312
Hey, why don't you stop makin'
smart remarks all the time, huh?

1080
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:19,524
My friend, for your three dollars a day,
you have to listen to everything, you know?

1081
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:21,317
Now that you've got that thing
in here, what about it?

1082
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,569
All right. Here's the apartment
where the killing took place.

1083
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:26,698
The old man's apartment was directly
beneath and exactly the same.

1084
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:29,993
Here are the el tracks, the bedroom,
living room, kitchen, bathroom.

1085
00:55:29,994 --> 00:55:32,078
Here's the hall.
Here are the stairs.

1086
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,414
Now, the old man was in
this bedroom right here.

1087
00:55:34,415 --> 00:55:37,166
He says he crossed to the door
and walked down the hall...

1088
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,211
opened the front door just in time to
see the boy running down the stairs.

1089
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:43,631
- Am I right so far?
- That's the story, for the 19th time.

1090
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:47,260
- Fifteen seconds after the body hit the floor.
- Correct.

1091
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:49,387
Now, let's see. It was...

1092
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:53,474
It's 12 feet from the bed to
the door. The hall is 43 feet.

1093
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:56,769
He would have had to walk 12 feet,
open the bedroom door...

1094
00:55:56,770 --> 00:56:00,481
walk 43 feet down and open the
front door all in 15 seconds.

1095
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:03,276
- Do you think he could have done it?
- Sure he could have done it.

1096
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:05,945
He can walk only very slowly. They had
to help him into the witness chair.

1097
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:07,697
You make it sound like a long walk.

1098
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:10,116
For an old man who had a
stroke, it is a long walk.

1099
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:11,241
Oh! What are you doing?

1100
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:13,636
I'm gonna try it,
see how long it took him.

1101
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:15,011
What do you mean,
you want to try it?

1102
00:56:15,012 --> 00:56:17,098
Why didn't his lawyer bring
it up if it's so important?

1103
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:18,381
Maybe he just didn't
think about it, huh?

1104
00:56:18,382 --> 00:56:20,835
What do you mean, didn't think of it?
You think the man's an idiot or something?

1105
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:22,462
- It's an obvious thing.
- Did you think of it?

1106
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:24,213
Listen, smart guy. Don't matter
whether I thought of it.

1107
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,524
He didn't bring it up because he knew it would
hurt his case. What do you think of that?

1108
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,487
Maybe he didn't bring it
up because it would have

1109
00:56:28,488 --> 00:56:30,470
meant bullying and badgering
a helpless old man.

1110
00:56:30,471 --> 00:56:33,890
You know that doesn't sit very well with
a jury. Most lawyers avoid it if they can.

1111
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:36,684
- So, what kind of a bum is he then?
- That's what I've been asking, buddy.

1112
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:39,812
Pass me that chair, will you?
Those two chairs are the old man's bed.

1113
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:42,774
I just paced off 12 feet across the room.
This will be the bedroom door.

1114
00:56:42,775 --> 00:56:45,485
Oh, that's crazy. You can't
recreate a thing like that.

1115
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:47,779
- I'd like to see it.
- The hall was 43 feet.

1116
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,881
I'll pace from that
wall and back again.

1117
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:54,994
Look, this is absolutely insane. What are
you wasting everybody's time in here for?

1118
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:57,955
According to you, it'll only take 15
seconds. Now, we can spare that, see.

1119
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,586
Come on. Knock it off.

1120
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:05,171
Okay.

1121
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:07,298
Okay. Okay, killer.

1122
00:57:07,299 --> 00:57:08,983
Yeah.

1123
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,346
Will you stand right there
and mark the front door?

1124
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:15,932
It was chain-locked according
to the testimony, remember?

1125
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:17,702
Has anybody got a watch
with a second hand?

1126
00:57:17,728 --> 00:57:18,184
I have.

1127
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:20,686
When you want me to start, stamp
your foot. That'll be the body falling.

1128
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,688
You can time me from there.

1129
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,857
What are we gonna do,
play charades now?

1130
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,984
- Come on! What are we waiting for?
- Okay, I'm ready.

1131
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,986
Well, I want to wait till
the second hand reaches 60.

1132
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:31,005
Oh, come on.

1133
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:40,723
Come on. Speed it up. He could
walk twice as fast as that.

1134
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:44,644
You want me to walk
faster than that, I will.

1135
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:03,980
Lock. Door. Stop.

1136
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:06,065
- Right.
- What's the time?

1137
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:09,402
Uh, exactly 41 seconds.

1138
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:11,737
This is what I think happened.

1139
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:14,657
The old man heard the fight between the
boy and his father a few hours earlier.

1140
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:17,577
Then when he's lying in bed, he heard the
body hit the floor in the boy's apartment...

1141
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:19,410
heard the woman scream
from across the street,

1142
00:58:19,436 --> 00:58:21,164
got to his front door
as fast as he could...

1143
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:23,833
heard somebody racing down the
stairs and assumed it was the boy.

1144
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:25,751
- I think that's possible.
- Assumed?

1145
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:28,337
Oh.

1146
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:31,812
Brother, I've seen all kinds
of dishonesty in my day,

1147
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:34,385
but this little display
takes the cake.

1148
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:36,863
You all come in here with
your hearts bleeding all

1149
00:58:36,864 --> 00:58:39,182
over the floor about
slum kids and injustice.

1150
00:58:39,183 --> 00:58:41,267
You listen to some fairy tales.

1151
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:43,644
Suddenly you start getting through
to some of these old ladies.

1152
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:46,689
Well, you're not getting through
to me. I've had enough.

1153
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,816
What's the matter with you guys?

1154
00:58:48,817 --> 00:58:51,611
You all know he's guilty!
He's got to burn!

1155
00:58:51,612 --> 00:58:53,487
You're letting him slip
through our fingers.

1156
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:55,781
"Slip through our fingers"?
Are you his executioner?

1157
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,550
I'm one of 'em!

1158
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:00,536
Perhaps you'd like
to pull the switch.

1159
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,622
For this kid, you bet I would.

1160
00:59:02,623 --> 00:59:05,975
I feel sorry for you. What it must
feel like to want to pull the switch.

1161
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:08,815
Ever since you walked into
this room, you've been

1162
00:59:08,816 --> 00:59:10,755
acting like a self-appointed
public avenger.

1163
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:12,819
You want to see this
boy die because you

1164
00:59:12,845 --> 00:59:15,134
personally want it,
not because of the facts.

1165
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:17,386
- You're a sadist.
- You...

1166
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:21,307
Let me go!
I'll kill him. I'll kill him!

1167
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:23,826
You don't really mean
you'll kill me, do you?

1168
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:33,444
Is there anything wrong, gentlemen?
I heard some noise.

1169
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:37,531
Oh, no. Everything's all right. We're just...
You know, friendly little argument. It's...

1170
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:40,926
Um, listen, we're through with that
diagram. You can take it if you want.

1171
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:43,971
Here you are. Thank you.

1172
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,604
What are you lookin' at?

1173
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:14,402
I suppose somebody has
to start it off again.

1174
01:00:14,403 --> 01:00:15,174
I beg pardon.

1175
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:18,197
"I beg pardon." What
are you so polite about?

1176
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:20,366
For the same reason you're not.

1177
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:22,468
It's the way I was brought up.

1178
01:00:24,288 --> 01:00:26,289
This fighting...

1179
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:28,416
That's not why we
are here, to fight.

1180
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:30,893
We have a responsibility.

1181
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:36,632
This, I have always thought, is a
remarkable thing about democracy...

1182
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,609
that we are...

1183
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,388
Uh, what is the word?

1184
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:45,558
Notified. That we are
notified by mail...

1185
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:49,979
to come down to this place to
decide on the guilt or innocence...

1186
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:54,108
of a man we have never
heard of before.

1187
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:58,754
We have nothing to gain or
lose by... by our verdict.

1188
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:02,800
This is one of the reasons
why we are strong.

1189
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:06,929
We should not make
it a personal thing.

1190
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:09,932
Thank you.

1191
01:01:11,043 --> 01:01:13,419
If nobody else has an idea,
I may have a cutie here.

1192
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:16,255
I mean, I haven't given it much thought,
but let's throw it out on the stoop...

1193
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:17,965
and see if the cat licks it up.

1194
01:01:17,966 --> 01:01:20,384
- The cat licks it up?
- Yeah. If the boy...

1195
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:27,016
Look how dark it's
getting out there.

1196
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:29,577
I'll bet we're gonna
have a storm now.

1197
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:33,831
Boy, oh, boy. It's really hot, huh?

1198
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:38,127
Pardon me, but don't
you ever sweat?

1199
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:41,697
No, I don't.

1200
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,783
Well, listen. I, uh...

1201
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:47,036
I was wondering if, uh, maybe...

1202
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:49,413
maybe we should take another vote.

1203
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:53,793
Oh, great. Maybe we can follow this one up
with a little dancing and refreshments, huh?

1204
01:01:53,794 --> 01:01:55,686
- Hmm.
- Mr. Foreman?

1205
01:01:56,380 --> 01:02:00,007
Well, that's okay with me.
Anyone doesn't want to vote?

1206
01:02:00,008 --> 01:02:03,302
- Hey, come on. Come on.
- I'm sorry.

1207
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:06,889
I think we ought to have an open
ballot... call out our votes, you know.

1208
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,183
Let's see who stands where.

1209
01:02:09,184 --> 01:02:11,785
That sounds fair to me.
Anyone object?

1210
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:17,249
Okay. I'll call off
your jury numbers. One.

1211
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:21,028
Oh, that's me. I vote guilty.

1212
01:02:21,029 --> 01:02:22,905
Two?

1213
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:24,507
Not guilty.

1214
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:27,885
- Number three?
- Guilty.

1215
01:02:28,787 --> 01:02:30,429
Number four?

1216
01:02:31,832 --> 01:02:33,707
Guilty.

1217
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:36,560
- Number five?
- Not guilty.

1218
01:02:37,546 --> 01:02:40,940
- Number six?
- Not guilty.

1219
01:02:41,842 --> 01:02:43,592
Number seven?

1220
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,386
Guilty.

1221
01:02:45,387 --> 01:02:47,513
Number eight?

1222
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:49,281
Not guilty.

1223
01:02:50,517 --> 01:02:53,519
- Number nine?
- Not guilty.

1224
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,788
- Number 10?
- Guilty.

1225
01:02:57,482 --> 01:02:59,608
Number 11?

1226
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,527
Not guilty.

1227
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:03,128
Number 12?

1228
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:06,365
Number 12.

1229
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:07,967
Guilty.

1230
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,958
The vote is now six to six.

1231
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:19,211
Yeah, right. And we go into
extra innings here, huh?

1232
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:26,135
Six to six. I'm telling you, some of you
people in here must be out of your minds.

1233
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:28,053
A kid like that.

1234
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:31,390
I don't think the kind of boy he
is has anything to do with it.

1235
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:33,559
The facts are supposed
to determine the case.

1236
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,811
Don't give me that!
I'm sick and tired of facts!

1237
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:37,897
You can twist them any way you like.
You know what I mean?

1238
01:03:37,898 --> 01:03:40,566
That's exactly the point this
gentleman has been making.

1239
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:41,167
Oh!

1240
01:03:41,193 --> 01:03:43,569
I mean, you keep shouting
at the top of your lungs.

1241
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:47,156
I'd like to be a few years younger.

1242
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:49,174
That man gets on my...

1243
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:55,372
- My, it's hot in here, isn't it?
- Do you want a drink of water?

1244
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:59,168
No. No, thanks. Thanks.

1245
01:04:06,927 --> 01:04:08,802
It's gonna rain.

1246
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:11,155
Well, how'd you figure
that out, killer?

1247
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:14,266
How come you changed your vote?

1248
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:16,769
Well, it just seemed to me
there was room for doubt.

1249
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:19,063
You haven't got a leg to stand on.
You know that, I hope.

1250
01:04:19,064 --> 01:04:22,149
I don't feel that way. There were a
lot of details that never came out.

1251
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:25,778
- Yeah. Well, good luck.
- Oh, come on. You're like everybody else.

1252
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:28,088
You think too much.
You get mixed up.

1253
01:04:29,241 --> 01:04:30,373
You know what I mean?

1254
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:33,285
Now, listen. I don't think
you have any right...

1255
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,955
Loudmouth.

1256
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:31,193
Look at that come down, will you?

1257
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:34,221
You know...

1258
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:36,807
this reminds me of a
storm we had last...

1259
01:05:36,808 --> 01:05:40,352
Oh, when was that? November...

1260
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:43,522
I don't know. Something. It was
quite a storm we had there.

1261
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:45,983
It was right in the
middle of a game.

1262
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:48,694
Uh, we were behind 7-6...

1263
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:51,363
but we just started to move the
ball, right off the tackle.

1264
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:54,241
Started cutting right...
slash here and slash right in...

1265
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:56,118
cut right through.

1266
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:58,704
And, uh...

1267
01:05:58,705 --> 01:06:01,014
We had this kid Slattery, you know?

1268
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:05,544
A real... He was an ox.
You know, a real ox.

1269
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:08,130
I wish I had another
one just like him.

1270
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:12,718
I forgot to tell you. I'm the assistant head
coach at the Andrew J. McCorkle High School.

1271
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:14,887
- Oh, yeah?
- That's out in Queens.

1272
01:06:14,888 --> 01:06:17,723
And, uh, anyway...

1273
01:06:17,724 --> 01:06:19,892
we're starting to
move along real nice.

1274
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:23,162
Their whole line is just...
they're just coming apart.

1275
01:06:24,356 --> 01:06:28,192
And it starts to come down
cats and dogs, just like this.

1276
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:30,919
Just whoosh...
you know, right down.

1277
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:35,574
Well, that was murder, you know?

1278
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:38,243
I swear, I... I nearly bawled.

1279
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:40,679
You just...
You couldn't go nowhere.

1280
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,265
Well.

1281
01:06:58,807 --> 01:07:01,408
Hey, what is it with this fan here?
How come...

1282
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:10,901
Hey! Huh?

1283
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:14,296
Must have been on the
same switch with the lights.

1284
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:18,467
Well, things are
looking up here, huh?

1285
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:20,636
Yeah, huh?

1286
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:27,476
Boy. That's better.

1287
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,634
Hey!

1288
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:37,402
Two points.

1289
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:43,408
Any of you guys ever
go to the Garden?

1290
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:48,564
That's a damn stupid thing to do.

1291
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:50,833
Oh, I'm sorry. I, uh...

1292
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:53,252
You know?

1293
01:07:54,863 --> 01:07:56,463
Pardon me.

1294
01:07:57,449 --> 01:07:59,867
Well, how do you like it?
Even Steven.

1295
01:07:59,868 --> 01:08:02,327
Pretty surprising, isn't it?

1296
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:03,929
Yes.

1297
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:09,209
Say, that business before, when
that tall guy... what's-his-name...

1298
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:12,004
was trying to bait me...
That doesn't prove anything.

1299
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:14,673
I'm a pretty excitable person.

1300
01:08:14,674 --> 01:08:18,594
I mean, where does he come off calling me
a public avenger, sadist and everything?

1301
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:22,181
Anyone in his right mind
would blow his stack, huh?

1302
01:08:22,182 --> 01:08:24,558
He was just trying to bait me.

1303
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:26,660
He did an excellent job.

1304
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:31,648
I'll tell you what I think.
We're going nowhere here.

1305
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:34,276
I'm ready to walk into court right
now and declare a hung jury.

1306
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:36,195
There's no point in this
thing going on any more.

1307
01:08:36,196 --> 01:08:37,613
Yeah. I go for that too.

1308
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:40,532
Listen, let's take it in to the judge and let
the kid take his chances with 12 other guys.

1309
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:43,452
I don't think the judge will accept a hung
jury. We haven't been in here very long.

1310
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:45,204
Well, let's find out.

1311
01:08:45,205 --> 01:08:46,997
I'm not in favor of that.

1312
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:50,292
Listen. This kid wouldn't stand a chance
with another jury, and you know it.

1313
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:53,212
Come on! We're hung. Nobody's gonna
change his vote. Let's take it inside.

1314
01:08:53,213 --> 01:08:55,506
You still don't think there's
room for reasonable doubt?

1315
01:08:55,507 --> 01:08:56,882
No, I don't.

1316
01:08:56,883 --> 01:08:58,258
Pardon.

1317
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:01,595
Maybe you don't fully understand
the term "reasonable doubt."

1318
01:09:01,596 --> 01:09:04,239
What do you mean
I don't understand?

1319
01:09:05,225 --> 01:09:07,267
Boy, how do ya like this guy?

1320
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:09,019
I'm tellin' ya, they're all alike.

1321
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:11,939
They come over here, running for their life,
and before they can take a deep breath...

1322
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:14,399
they're telling us how
to run the show, huh?

1323
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,276
Boy, the arrogance of this guy.

1324
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:20,948
Hey, all right. Let's stop the
arguing for about two minutes in here.

1325
01:09:20,949 --> 01:09:23,408
Now, who's got something
constructive to say?

1326
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:27,037
I'd like to go over something,
if you gentlemen don't mind.

1327
01:09:27,038 --> 01:09:29,790
An important point for the
prosecution was the fact...

1328
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:32,626
that after the boy claimed
he'd been at the movies...

1329
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:34,711
during the hours that the
killing took place...

1330
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:38,674
couldn't remember the names of the movies
or the stars who appeared in them.

1331
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:41,260
This gentleman here has put up
that point in here several times.

1332
01:09:41,261 --> 01:09:42,803
That's correct.

1333
01:09:42,804 --> 01:09:44,763
It was the only alibi
the boy offered...

1334
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:47,349
and he himself couldn't back
it up with any details at all.

1335
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:50,686
Putting yourself in the boy's place,
do you think you could remember details...

1336
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:54,231
after an upsetting experience such as
being slapped in the face by your father?

1337
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:57,526
I think so, if there were any
special details to remember.

1338
01:09:57,527 --> 01:09:59,231
The boy couldn't remember
the names of the movies

1339
01:09:59,232 --> 01:10:00,779
he saw because be wasn't
there that night.

1340
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,906
According to the police
testimony in court...

1341
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:06,118
the boy was questioned by the detectives
in the kitchen of his apartment...

1342
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:09,121
while the body of his father was
lying on the floor in the bedroom.

1343
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:11,790
Do you think you could remember
details under those circumstances?

1344
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:13,876
- I do.
- Under great emotional stress?

1345
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:16,461
- Under great emotional stress.
- He remembered them correctly in court.

1346
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:18,505
He named the pictures and the
stars who played in them.

1347
01:10:18,506 --> 01:10:21,758
Yes. His lawyer took great
pains to bring that out.

1348
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:24,386
He had three months from the night
of the murder to the day of the trial...

1349
01:10:24,387 --> 01:10:26,096
in which to memorize them.

1350
01:10:26,097 --> 01:10:28,849
It's not difficult for a lawyer to find out
what played at a particular theater...

1351
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:30,601
on a particular night.

1352
01:10:30,602 --> 01:10:32,417
I'll take the testimony
of the policemen who

1353
01:10:32,443 --> 01:10:34,313
interrogated the boy right
after the murder...

1354
01:10:34,314 --> 01:10:36,815
when he couldn't remember
a thing about the movies...

1355
01:10:36,816 --> 01:10:38,817
great emotional stress or not.

1356
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:42,195
- I'd like to ask you a personal question.
- Go ahead.

1357
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:45,532
- Where were you last night?
- I was home.

1358
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:48,160
- How about the night before that?
- Come on! What is this?

1359
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:49,578
No, it's all right.

1360
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:52,205
I left the office at 8:30 and
went straight home and to bed.

1361
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:53,957
And the night before that?

1362
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:56,460
That was, uh, Tuesday night?

1363
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:58,545
The night of the bridge tournament.
I played bridge.

1364
01:10:58,546 --> 01:10:59,963
Monday night?

1365
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:03,275
When you get down to New
Year's Eve, 1954, let me know, huh?

1366
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:07,237
Monday night?

1367
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:11,475
Monday night, uh, my wife
and I went to the movies.

1368
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:13,185
- What did you see?
- The Scarlet Circle.

1369
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:16,521
- It was a clever whodunit.
- What was the second feature?

1370
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:19,232
The, um...

1371
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:21,985
I'll tell you in a minute.
The, uh...

1372
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:26,239
Remarkable Mrs., uh, something...

1373
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,784
The...

1374
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:31,536
Mrs. Bainbridge.
The Remarkable Mrs. Bainbridge.

1375
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:34,389
I saw that. It's called
The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.

1376
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:38,043
Uh, yes. The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.
I think that's right.

1377
01:11:38,044 --> 01:11:40,629
Who was in The Amazing
Mrs. Bainbridge?

1378
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:44,383
Barbara... Long, I think it was.

1379
01:11:44,384 --> 01:11:46,485
A dark, very pretty girl.

1380
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,305
Ling or Long...
something like that.

1381
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:53,600
- Who else?
- I'd never heard of them before.

1382
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:58,105
It was a very inexpensive second
feature with, uh, unknown...

1383
01:11:58,106 --> 01:12:01,333
And you weren't under an
emotional stress, were you?

1384
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:06,363
No.

1385
01:12:06,364 --> 01:12:08,131
I wasn't.

1386
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:11,743
I think the point is made.

1387
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:14,579
Big point!

1388
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,832
You can talk till your tongue
is draggin' on the floor.

1389
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:21,003
The boy is guilty, period.
You know what I mean, my friend?

1390
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:24,356
- Who's got those cough drops?
- They're all gone, my friend.

1391
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:28,593
Oh, boy. Look at that rain.

1392
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:31,054
There goes your ball game.

1393
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:33,557
It's only a shower.

1394
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:35,809
Besides, they got the
infield covered.

1395
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:39,079
Right. Say, could I see that
knife a second, please?

1396
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:44,192
Well, we're still
tied up six to six.

1397
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:46,278
Who's got a suggestion?

1398
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:48,363
It's five after 6:00.
Let's get some dinner.

1399
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,907
Why don't we wait till 7:00,
give it another hour, huh?

1400
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:53,118
Okay with me.

1401
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:55,370
Uh, there's something
I'd like to say.

1402
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:58,999
I mean, it's been bothering me a little,
and as long as we're stuck.

1403
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,961
Well, there was this whole business about
the stab wound and how it was made...

1404
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:04,671
the downward angle of it, you know?

1405
01:13:04,672 --> 01:13:06,757
Don't tell me we're gonna
start with that again.

1406
01:13:06,758 --> 01:13:08,467
They've been over it and over it.

1407
01:13:08,468 --> 01:13:10,844
Well, I know they did,
but I don't go along with it.

1408
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:14,931
Now, the boy was 5 feet 7
inches tall. His father was 6'2...

1409
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:17,184
That's a difference
of seven inches.

1410
01:13:17,185 --> 01:13:19,936
It's a very awkward thing to stab
down into the chest of someone...

1411
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:22,022
who's more than half a
foot taller than you are.

1412
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:24,232
Give me that.

1413
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:27,127
I'll give you a demonstration.
Somebody get up.

1414
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,422
You...

1415
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:37,621
I want you to watch this 'cause
I don't want to have to do it again.

1416
01:13:37,622 --> 01:13:40,457
I'll make myself about six or
seven inches shorter, okay?

1417
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:43,685
- It's about right. Maybe a little more.
- Okay. A little more.

1418
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:53,904
That's not funny.

1419
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:59,826
Now, nobody's hurt. Right?

1420
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:02,287
Right. Nobody hurt.

1421
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:10,529
Now, this is the way I'd stab a
man who was taller than I was.

1422
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:13,073
Look at the angle... down and in.

1423
01:14:13,074 --> 01:14:15,242
And this is the way it was done.

1424
01:14:15,243 --> 01:14:17,510
Now tell me I'm wrong.

1425
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:23,125
- Down and in. I guess there's no argument.
- Hold it a minute, will ya?

1426
01:14:23,126 --> 01:14:25,060
Can you give me that?

1427
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:27,963
Boy, I hate these things.

1428
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:29,714
- Did you ever see a knife fight?
- No.

1429
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:31,383
- You?
- No.

1430
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:34,261
Anybody here ever
see a knife fight?

1431
01:14:34,262 --> 01:14:37,139
Well, I have. You know,
on my back stoop...

1432
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:39,558
the lot across
the street, backyard.

1433
01:14:39,559 --> 01:14:42,060
Switchblades came with the
neighborhood where I lived.

1434
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:45,397
It's funny I never thought of it before.
I guess you try to forget those things.

1435
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:48,875
- How do you use a switchblade?
- Well, you'd never use it like this.

1436
01:14:50,528 --> 01:14:52,921
See, you use too much
time switching hands.

1437
01:14:54,574 --> 01:14:57,175
Here's how... underhanded.

1438
01:14:59,787 --> 01:15:02,914
Anyone who's ever used a switch knife
wouldn't handle it any other way.

1439
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:05,625
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

1440
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:07,544
That's why they're made
to open like that.

1441
01:15:07,545 --> 01:15:09,713
You'd say the boy was
pretty handy with a knife?

1442
01:15:09,739 --> 01:15:10,255
Mm-hmm.

1443
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:13,508
You think he could have made the kind
of wound that killed his father?

1444
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:17,512
No. Not with the experience he'd had
all his life handling these things.

1445
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:19,598
I feel he'd have gone
for him underhanded.

1446
01:15:19,599 --> 01:15:22,726
How do you know? Were you in the
room when the father was killed?

1447
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:24,811
No. Neither was anybody else.

1448
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:28,106
So what are you giving us all this
mumbo jumbo for? I don't believe it.

1449
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:29,757
I don't think you can
determine what type of

1450
01:15:29,783 --> 01:15:31,443
wound the boy might or
might not have made...

1451
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:34,154
simply because he knew
how to handle a knife.

1452
01:15:34,155 --> 01:15:36,573
What do you think?

1453
01:15:36,574 --> 01:15:38,742
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

1454
01:15:38,743 --> 01:15:40,677
I don't know.

1455
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:46,875
How about you?

1456
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:48,787
I don't know about the rest
of them, but I'm getting a

1457
01:15:48,788 --> 01:15:50,712
little tired of this
yackety-yackin' back and forth.

1458
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:54,257
It's gettin' us nowhere. So I
guess I'll have to break it up.

1459
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:56,885
I change my vote to not guilty.

1460
01:15:56,886 --> 01:16:00,305
- You what?
- You heard me. I've had enough.

1461
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:02,849
What do you mean you've had enough?
That's no answer!

1462
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:06,895
Hey, listen. You just take care
of yourself, huh? You know?

1463
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:10,941
He's right. That's not an answer.

1464
01:16:10,942 --> 01:16:13,985
What kind of a man are you?

1465
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:17,197
You have sat here and voted
guilty with everyone else...

1466
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:21,534
because there are some baseball tickets
burning a hole in your pocket.

1467
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:25,889
And now you've changed your vote because
you say you're sick of all the talking here?

1468
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:28,333
Now listen, buddy!

1469
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:33,088
Who tells you that you have the right
to play like this with a man's life?

1470
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:35,674
- Don't you care...
- Now wait a minute!

1471
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:39,761
- You can't talk like that to me!
- I can talk like that to you.

1472
01:16:39,762 --> 01:16:41,721
If you want to vote not guilty...

1473
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:44,182
then do it because you are
convinced the man is not guilty...

1474
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:46,059
not because you've had enough.

1475
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:48,728
And if you think he is guilty,
then vote that way.

1476
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:52,023
Or don't you have the guts to
do what you think is right?

1477
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:54,376
- Now listen.
- Guilty or not guilty?

1478
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:58,755
- I told you, not guilty.
- Why?

1479
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:02,033
Look, I don't have to...

1480
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:05,245
You do have to! Say it! Why?

1481
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:07,806
All right. I don't, uh,
think he's guilty.

1482
01:17:17,216 --> 01:17:18,925
I want another vote.

1483
01:17:18,926 --> 01:17:21,511
Okay. There's another
vote called for.

1484
01:17:21,512 --> 01:17:24,472
I guess the quickest way is a
show of hands. Anyone object?

1485
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:27,492
Okay. All those voting not
guilty, raise your hands.

1486
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:33,581
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

1487
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:38,086
eight.

1488
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:44,134
Um, nine.

1489
01:17:45,036 --> 01:17:50,123
Um, all those voting guilty,
raise your hands.

1490
01:17:50,124 --> 01:17:52,584
One, two, three.

1491
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:55,186
Well, the vote's nine to
three in favor of acquittal.

1492
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:58,340
I don't understand you people!

1493
01:17:58,341 --> 01:18:00,592
I mean, all these picky little
points you keep bringing up.

1494
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:04,012
They don't mean nothing!
You saw this kid just like I did.

1495
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:07,599
You're not gonna tell me you believe that
phony story about losing the knife...

1496
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,684
and that business about
being at the movies.

1497
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:12,771
Look, you know how these
people lie. It's born in them.

1498
01:18:12,772 --> 01:18:14,898
I mean, what the heck.
I don't have to tell you.

1499
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:16,941
They don't know what the truth is.

1500
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:20,737
And let me tell you, they don't need any
real big reason to kill someone either.

1501
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:22,572
No, sir.

1502
01:18:22,573 --> 01:18:25,700
They get drunk! Oh, they're
real big drinkers, all of 'em.

1503
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:28,953
You know that. And bang...
someone's lying in the gutter.

1504
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:32,040
Well, nobody's blaming them for it.
That's the way they are, by nature.

1505
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:34,209
You know what I mean? Violent!

1506
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,794
Where are you going?

1507
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:38,897
Human life don't mean as much
to them as it does to us.

1508
01:18:39,799 --> 01:18:42,884
Look! They're lushing it up
and fighting all the time...

1509
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:44,969
and if somebody gets killed,
so somebody gets killed!

1510
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:46,429
They don't care!

1511
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,723
Oh, sure, there's some
good things about 'em too.

1512
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:50,767
Look, I'm the first
one to say that.

1513
01:18:50,768 --> 01:18:54,145
I've known a couple who were okay, but
that's the exception, you know what I mean?

1514
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:57,982
Most of 'em, it's like they have
no feelings. They can do anything.

1515
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:00,652
What's going on here?

1516
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:02,779
I'm... I'm trying to tell ya...

1517
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:04,864
you're making a big
mistake, you people.

1518
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:07,967
This kid is a liar! I know it.
I know all about them.

1519
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:11,830
Listen to me. They're no good.

1520
01:19:11,831 --> 01:19:14,265
There's not a one of
'em who's any good.

1521
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:18,753
I mean, what...
What's happening in here?

1522
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:21,105
I'm speaking my piece, and you...

1523
01:19:22,216 --> 01:19:23,983
Listen to me.

1524
01:19:24,969 --> 01:19:26,511
I...

1525
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:29,055
We're... This kid on
trial here, his type...

1526
01:19:29,056 --> 01:19:31,157
Well, don't you know about them?

1527
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:36,563
Th-There's...
There's a danger here.

1528
01:19:36,564 --> 01:19:38,731
These people are dangerous.

1529
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:41,860
They're... wild.

1530
01:19:41,861 --> 01:19:43,862
Listen to me.

1531
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:46,281
- Listen.
- I have.

1532
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:49,384
Now sit down and don't
open your mouth again.

1533
01:19:53,205 --> 01:19:56,057
I was only trying to... tell you.

1534
01:20:32,453 --> 01:20:36,848
It's always difficult to keep personal
prejudice out of a thing like this.

1535
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:41,978
Wherever you run into it,
prejudice always obscures the truth.

1536
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:45,924
I don't really know
what the truth is.

1537
01:20:45,925 --> 01:20:48,943
I don't suppose anybody
will ever really know.

1538
01:20:50,137 --> 01:20:54,182
Nine of us now seem to feel
that the defendant is innocent.

1539
01:20:54,183 --> 01:20:57,268
But we're just gambling
on probabilities.

1540
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:59,312
We may be wrong.

1541
01:20:59,313 --> 01:21:01,773
We may be trying to let
a guilty man go free.

1542
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:03,316
I don't know.

1543
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:05,401
Nobody really can.

1544
01:21:05,402 --> 01:21:07,862
But we have a reasonable doubt...

1545
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:11,449
and that's something that's
very valuable in our system.

1546
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:16,095
No jury can declare a man
guilty unless it's sure.

1547
01:21:17,456 --> 01:21:19,916
We nine can't understand...

1548
01:21:19,917 --> 01:21:22,727
how you three are still so sure.

1549
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:25,563
- Maybe you can tell us.
- I'll try.

1550
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:30,426
You've made some excellent points, but I
still believe the boy is guilty of murder...

1551
01:21:30,427 --> 01:21:32,220
and I have two reasons.

1552
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:35,431
One, the evidence given by the
woman across the street...

1553
01:21:35,432 --> 01:21:38,142
who actually saw the
murder committed.

1554
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:40,812
As far as I'm concerned,
that's the most important testimony.

1555
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:44,148
And two, the fact that she described
the stabbing by saying...

1556
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:49,862
she saw the boy raise his arm over his head
and stab down into the father's chest.

1557
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:51,990
She saw him do it the wrong way.

1558
01:21:51,991 --> 01:21:53,992
That's absolutely right.

1559
01:21:53,993 --> 01:21:56,661
Let's talk about this
woman for a moment.

1560
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:59,831
She said she went to bed
about 11:00 that night.

1561
01:21:59,832 --> 01:22:03,501
Her bed was next to the window,
and she could look out while lying down...

1562
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:07,672
and see directly into the
boy's room across the street.

1563
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:10,383
She tossed and turned for over
an hour, unable to sleep.

1564
01:22:10,384 --> 01:22:14,637
Finally, she turned toward the window
at about 10 minutes after 12:00...

1565
01:22:14,638 --> 01:22:19,851
and, as she looked out, she saw the killing
through the windows of a passing el train.

1566
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:22,645
She said the lights went out
immediately after the killing...

1567
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:27,542
but that she got a good look at the boy
in the act of stabbing his father.

1568
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:32,380
As far as I can see it,
this is unshakable testimony.

1569
01:22:33,032 --> 01:22:35,800
- Well, that's the whole case.
- What do you think?

1570
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:42,849
How about you?

1571
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:46,919
I-I don't know.

1572
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:49,005
So much evidence to sift.

1573
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:51,049
This is a pretty
complicated business.

1574
01:22:51,050 --> 01:22:54,927
Frankly, I don't see how you
can vote for acquittal.

1575
01:22:54,928 --> 01:22:57,347
It's not so easy to arrange
all the evidence in order.

1576
01:22:57,348 --> 01:22:59,474
You can throw out
all the other evidence!

1577
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:03,144
The woman saw him do it!
What else do you want?

1578
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:05,104
- Yeah, well, maybe...
- Let's vote on it.

1579
01:23:05,105 --> 01:23:07,357
Okay. There's another
vote called for.

1580
01:23:07,358 --> 01:23:09,275
Anybody object?

1581
01:23:09,276 --> 01:23:12,403
All right. I'm changing my vote.
He's guilty.

1582
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:14,906
Anybody else?
The vote is eight to four.

1583
01:23:14,907 --> 01:23:18,576
Why is this such a personal
triumph for you... this one vote?

1584
01:23:18,577 --> 01:23:22,121
Okay. I say we're a hung jury.
I say we take it in to the judge.

1585
01:23:22,122 --> 01:23:24,916
How about it?
I want to hear arguments.

1586
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:27,518
You, you're the leader of
the cause. What about it?

1587
01:23:29,672 --> 01:23:31,589
Let's go over it again.

1588
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:33,591
We've been over it again!

1589
01:23:33,592 --> 01:23:36,170
The boy in the gray flannel
suit here is bouncin'

1590
01:23:36,171 --> 01:23:38,471
backwards and forwards
like a tennis ball.

1591
01:23:38,472 --> 01:23:42,408
No point in getting nasty and
trying to turn this into a contest.

1592
01:23:44,269 --> 01:23:45,812
Okay.

1593
01:23:45,813 --> 01:23:48,940
Maybe we can talk about setting
some kind of time limit.

1594
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:51,167
Yeah, once around
for the deal, huh?

1595
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:55,613
It's a quarter after 6:00.

1596
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:57,657
Someone before mentioned 7:00.

1597
01:23:57,658 --> 01:24:00,118
I think that's a point at which
we might begin to discuss...

1598
01:24:00,119 --> 01:24:03,454
the question of whether
we're a hung jury or not.

1599
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:05,223
Don't you feel well?

1600
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:08,501
I feel perfectly well, thank you.

1601
01:24:08,502 --> 01:24:11,295
I was saying that 7:00
would be a reasonable time.

1602
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:14,298
Uh, the reason I asked about
that was because, uh...

1603
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:15,967
you were rubbing your nose like...

1604
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:18,720
Oh, I'm sorry for interrupting...

1605
01:24:18,721 --> 01:24:22,014
but you made a gesture that
reminded me of something.

1606
01:24:22,015 --> 01:24:24,142
I'm trying to settle something
here. Do you mind?

1607
01:24:24,143 --> 01:24:26,244
Well, I think this is important.

1608
01:24:27,229 --> 01:24:29,105
Thank you.

1609
01:24:29,106 --> 01:24:31,816
Now then, I'm sure you'll
pardon me for this...

1610
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:34,819
but I was wondering why you were
rubbing your nose like that.

1611
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:36,571
Oh, come on, will ya?

1612
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:40,825
At this point, I happen to be talking
to the gentleman sitting next to you!

1613
01:24:40,826 --> 01:24:44,162
Now, why were you rubbing
your nose like that?

1614
01:24:44,163 --> 01:24:48,332
Well, if it's any of your business, I was
rubbing it because it bothers me a little.

1615
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:50,042
Oh. I'm sorry.

1616
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:54,005
- Is it... Is it because of your eyeglasses?
- It is.

1617
01:24:54,006 --> 01:24:55,840
Now can we get on
to something else?

1618
01:24:55,841 --> 01:25:00,511
Your eyeglasses made those two deep
impressions on the sides of your nose.

1619
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:02,764
I hadn't noticed that before.

1620
01:25:02,765 --> 01:25:06,350
- That must be annoying.
- It is very annoying.

1621
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:08,352
Well, I wouldn't know about that.

1622
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:11,773
I've never worn eyeglasses.
Twenty-twenty.

1623
01:25:11,774 --> 01:25:14,417
Listen, will you come on already
with the optometrist bit?

1624
01:25:16,236 --> 01:25:19,864
The woman who testified
that she saw the killing...

1625
01:25:19,865 --> 01:25:23,509
had those same marks on
the sides of her nose.

1626
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:26,704
Holy smokes! You know, he's right.

1627
01:25:26,705 --> 01:25:28,456
Please.

1628
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:32,293
Just give me a minute,
and I'll be finished.

1629
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:35,213
I don't know if anyone else
noticed that about her.

1630
01:25:35,214 --> 01:25:39,191
I didn't think of it then,
but I've been going over her face...

1631
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:42,345
in my mind.

1632
01:25:42,346 --> 01:25:44,447
She had those same marks.

1633
01:25:45,349 --> 01:25:49,619
- She kept rubbing them in court.
- He's right. She did do that a lot.

1634
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:55,316
This woman was about, uh...
about 45 years old.

1635
01:25:55,317 --> 01:25:59,362
She was making a tremendous
effort to look 35...

1636
01:25:59,363 --> 01:26:01,656
for her first public appearance.

1637
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:04,992
Heavy makeup, dyed hair...

1638
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:08,955
brand-new clothes that should have
been worn by a younger woman.

1639
01:26:08,956 --> 01:26:10,706
No glasses.

1640
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:12,458
No, women do that.

1641
01:26:12,459 --> 01:26:14,961
See if you can get the
mental picture of it.

1642
01:26:14,962 --> 01:26:16,879
What do you mean, no glasses?

1643
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,674
How do you know whether she wore glasses?
Just 'cause she was rubbing her nose?

1644
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:21,968
Now, she had those
marks. I saw 'em.

1645
01:26:21,969 --> 01:26:23,970
So what? What do ya
think that means?

1646
01:26:23,971 --> 01:26:26,238
Listen, I'm getting so sick
of your yelling in here!

1647
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:27,265
Come on. Forget it.

1648
01:26:27,266 --> 01:26:30,351
Hey, listen. Listen, he's right.
I saw them too.

1649
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:33,563
I was the closest one to her. She had these,
these things on the side of her nose.

1650
01:26:33,564 --> 01:26:36,858
- What do you call those on the side?
- Well, what point are you making here?

1651
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:40,820
She had dyed hair, marks on her nose.
Well, what does that mean?

1652
01:26:40,821 --> 01:26:45,216
Could those marks be made by
anything other than eyeglasses?

1653
01:26:48,704 --> 01:26:51,122
No, they couldn't.

1654
01:26:51,123 --> 01:26:53,224
I didn't see any marks!

1655
01:26:54,751 --> 01:26:56,544
I did.

1656
01:26:56,545 --> 01:26:59,171
Strange, but I didn't
think about it before.

1657
01:26:59,172 --> 01:27:01,382
Well, what about the lawyer?
Why didn't he say something?

1658
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:04,385
There are 12 people in here
concentrating on this case.

1659
01:27:04,386 --> 01:27:06,554
Eleven of us didn't
think of it either.

1660
01:27:06,555 --> 01:27:09,807
Well, what about the district attorney?
Do you think he'd pull a trick like that?

1661
01:27:09,808 --> 01:27:11,784
Have her testify
without her glasses?

1662
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:13,716
Did you ever see a woman who
had to wear glasses and

1663
01:27:13,717 --> 01:27:15,813
didn't want to because she
thinks they spoil her looks?

1664
01:27:15,814 --> 01:27:19,400
Okay. She had marks on her nose.

1665
01:27:19,401 --> 01:27:23,154
I'm giving you that.
From glasses, right?

1666
01:27:23,155 --> 01:27:27,408
She didn't want to wear 'em out of the house
so people would think she's gorgeous.

1667
01:27:27,409 --> 01:27:32,079
But when she saw this kid killing his
father, she was in the house alone.

1668
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:34,373
That's all.

1669
01:27:34,374 --> 01:27:38,477
- Do you wear glasses when you go to bed?
- No, I don't.

1670
01:27:40,088 --> 01:27:42,089
No one wears eyeglasses to bed.

1671
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:45,176
It's logical to assume that she wasn't
wearing them when she was in bed...

1672
01:27:45,177 --> 01:27:47,011
tossing and turning,
trying to fall asleep.

1673
01:27:47,012 --> 01:27:49,430
- How do you know?
- I don't know! I'm guessing.

1674
01:27:49,431 --> 01:27:51,974
I'm also guessing that she probably
didn't put her glasses on...

1675
01:27:51,975 --> 01:27:54,185
when she turned to look
casually out of the window.

1676
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:57,021
And she herself testified the killing
took place just as she looked out.

1677
01:27:57,022 --> 01:27:58,481
The lights went off a
split second later.

1678
01:27:58,507 --> 01:28:00,149
She couldn't have had
time to put them on then.

1679
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:01,859
- Wait a second.
- Here's another guess.

1680
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:06,030
Maybe she honestly thought she saw the boy
kill his father. I say she only saw a blur.

1681
01:28:06,031 --> 01:28:09,700
How do you know what she saw?
How does he know all that?

1682
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:12,536
How do you know what kind of glasses
she wore? Maybe they were sunglasses.

1683
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:15,247
Maybe she was farsighted.
What do you know about it?

1684
01:28:15,248 --> 01:28:18,584
I only know the woman's
eyesight is in question now.

1685
01:28:18,585 --> 01:28:24,799
She had to be able to identify a person
60 feet away, at night, without glasses.

1686
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:27,259
You can't send someone off to
die on evidence like that.

1687
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:29,345
Oh, don't give me that.

1688
01:28:29,346 --> 01:28:31,597
Don't you think the woman
might have made a mistake?

1689
01:28:31,598 --> 01:28:34,100
- No.
- It's not possible?

1690
01:28:34,101 --> 01:28:35,826
No, it's not possible.

1691
01:28:38,689 --> 01:28:40,706
Is it possible?

1692
01:28:41,733 --> 01:28:43,501
Not guilty.

1693
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:50,324
Do you think he's guilty?

1694
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:52,426
I think he's guilty.

1695
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,847
Do you?

1696
01:28:59,626 --> 01:29:02,753
No. I'm convinced.

1697
01:29:02,754 --> 01:29:04,422
Not guilty.

1698
01:29:04,423 --> 01:29:06,298
What's the matter with you?

1699
01:29:06,299 --> 01:29:08,300
I have a reasonable doubt now.

1700
01:29:08,301 --> 01:29:09,927
Eleven to one.

1701
01:29:09,928 --> 01:29:12,930
Well, what about all the other evidence?
What about all that stuff?

1702
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:15,099
The knife, the whole business!

1703
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:18,119
Well, you said we could throw
out all the other evidence.

1704
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:26,043
Well, what do we do now?

1705
01:29:28,947 --> 01:29:30,698
You're alone.

1706
01:29:30,699 --> 01:29:34,635
I don't care whether
I'm alone or not! It's my right.

1707
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:39,974
It's your right.

1708
01:29:49,009 --> 01:29:51,527
Well, what do you want?
I say he's guilty.

1709
01:29:53,055 --> 01:29:56,490
- We want to hear your arguments.
- I gave you my arguments.

1710
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:59,602
We're not convinced.

1711
01:29:59,603 --> 01:30:02,480
We want to hear them again.

1712
01:30:02,481 --> 01:30:04,582
We have as much time as it takes.

1713
01:30:10,155 --> 01:30:14,700
Everything... Every single thing
that took place in that courtroom...

1714
01:30:14,701 --> 01:30:16,702
but I mean everything...
says he's guilty.

1715
01:30:16,703 --> 01:30:19,263
What do you think,
I'm an idiot or something?

1716
01:30:20,832 --> 01:30:23,000
Why don't you take that
stuff about the old man?

1717
01:30:23,001 --> 01:30:26,270
The old man who lived there
and heard everything.

1718
01:30:27,839 --> 01:30:29,590
Or this business about the knife.

1719
01:30:29,591 --> 01:30:31,675
What? 'Cause he found another
one exactly like it?

1720
01:30:31,676 --> 01:30:35,096
The old man saw him right
there on the stairs!

1721
01:30:35,097 --> 01:30:38,032
What's the difference how
many seconds it was?

1722
01:30:39,101 --> 01:30:41,202
Every single thing.

1723
01:30:42,521 --> 01:30:45,773
The knife falling through
a hole in his pocket.

1724
01:30:45,774 --> 01:30:49,193
You can't prove he
didn't get to the door.

1725
01:30:49,194 --> 01:30:51,695
Sure, you can take all the time,
hobble around the room.

1726
01:30:51,696 --> 01:30:54,381
But you can't prove it!

1727
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:59,912
And what about this business
of the el and the movies?

1728
01:30:59,913 --> 01:31:03,040
There's a phony deal
if I ever heard one.

1729
01:31:03,041 --> 01:31:07,336
I'll bet ya $5,000 I'd
remember the movies I saw.

1730
01:31:07,337 --> 01:31:09,672
I'm telling ya, everything
that's gone on...

1731
01:31:09,673 --> 01:31:13,592
has been twisted and turned!

1732
01:31:13,593 --> 01:31:15,761
This business with the glasses?

1733
01:31:15,762 --> 01:31:21,392
How do you know she didn't have them on?
This woman testified in open court!

1734
01:31:21,393 --> 01:31:25,437
And what about hearing
the kid yell, huh?

1735
01:31:25,438 --> 01:31:28,791
I'm telling ya, I've got
all the facts here.

1736
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:31,835
Here. Ah...

1737
01:31:34,114 --> 01:31:36,715
Well, that's it!
That's the whole case.

1738
01:31:43,832 --> 01:31:45,516
Well?

1739
01:31:47,711 --> 01:31:49,812
Say something!

1740
01:31:54,843 --> 01:31:58,529
You lousy bunch of bleeding hearts.

1741
01:31:59,097 --> 01:32:01,098
You're not gonna intimidate me.

1742
01:32:01,099 --> 01:32:03,701
I'm entitled to my opinion.

1743
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:11,375
Rotten kids.
You work your life out!

1744
01:32:16,114 --> 01:32:18,173
I can't keep...

1745
01:32:22,746 --> 01:32:24,513
No.

1746
01:32:28,293 --> 01:32:30,227
Not guilty.

1747
01:32:33,506 --> 01:32:35,274
Not guilty.

1748
01:32:38,178 --> 01:32:39,887
Not...

1749
01:32:50,357 --> 01:32:52,624
Um, we're ready now.

1750
01:34:46,181 --> 01:34:47,948
Hey!

1751
01:34:52,187 --> 01:34:53,937
What's your name?

1752
01:34:53,938 --> 01:34:55,522
Davis.

1753
01:34:55,523 --> 01:34:57,541
My name's McCardle.

1754
01:34:59,778 --> 01:35:01,528
Well, so long.

1755
01:35:01,529 --> 01:35:03,130
So long.
