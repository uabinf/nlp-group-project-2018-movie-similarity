1
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:32,124
Aah!

2
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:40,199
Wait a minute. He ain't dead!

3
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:49,441
Let's go! Let's go!

4
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:12,464
Frank! Get out!

5
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:23,408
Come on, Frank.

6
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:34,453
Jesus! Let's get
the hell out of here!

7
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,525
Frank!

8
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:41,326
Frank!

9
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:51,303
Frank!

10
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,844
Frank!

11
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:03,448
Hey, come back! Come back, God damn it!
Come back! Don't leave!

12
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:19,631
<i>But on this joyous day,</i>

13
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:21,800
<i>one sobering question,</i>
<i>one haunting question remains.</i>

14
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,802
<i>Are they all back?</i>

15
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:26,805
<i>Still listed as</i>
<i>missing in action...</i>

16
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:29,808
<i>Are 2,500 American men.</i>

17
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,811
<i>Are any of them</i>
<i>still being held prisoner?</i>

18
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,280
<i>For the families of those men,</i>

19
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:37,816
<i>the vietnamese war</i>
<i>will never be over...</i>

20
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:41,820
<i>Until that question</i>
<i>is answered.</i>

21
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:43,822
<i>We're waiting</i>
<i>for the first p.O.W.</i>

22
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,824
<i>To emerge from the plane.</i>

23
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,826
<i>All of America waiting,</i>

24
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:50,829
<i>and in particular,</i>
<i>his family is waiting.</i>

25
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:54,833
<i>We'll see these heroes</i>
<i>emerging momentarily.</i>

26
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:59,404
<i>We're waiting now for,</i>
<i>on this momentous day,</i>

27
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:03,342
<i>the end of the war</i>
<i>officially for them.</i>

28
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:05,377
<i>This day, march 7, 1973.</i>

29
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:08,380
<i>The first one coming off now!</i>

30
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:10,415
<i>He looks a little thin,</i>

31
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,718
<i>but considering</i>
<i>what he's been through,</i>

32
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,988
<i>he looks very good from here.</i>

33
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,390
<i>He's approaching</i>
<i>his family now.</i>

34
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:21,760
<i>We're waiting</i>
<i>for others to come off.</i>

35
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,730
<i>There's the official reunion.</i>

36
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:26,698
<i>The war is over for him.</i>

37
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,003
For other American families,
the agonizing will continue...

38
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:36,575
<i>Until they find out the
fate of their missing sons.</i>

39
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,845
<i>Daddy!</i>

40
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,585
<i>Daddy.</i>

41
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:50,555
<i>I'm scared.</i>

42
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:53,358
<i>Can I sleep with you tonight?</i>

43
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:42,374
Colonel rhodes,
I sympathize, but...

44
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:44,109
I don't want your sympathy!

45
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:47,379
I want you to help me
find my son.

46
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:48,780
But don't you understand?

47
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,115
There's nothing I can do.

48
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:52,718
There are 2,500 men
still unaccounted for.

49
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
There have been over
400 live sightings...

50
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:56,822
Of Americans held
against their will.

51
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:58,790
I've heard the numbers.
There's nothing I can do.

52
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,126
That's all I ever
heard in Washington.

53
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:02,728
Nobody can do anything.

54
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,730
That's why I came to Bangkok.

55
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:07,099
Look, you didn't
hear this from me,

56
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:09,701
but there are a couple
of men here in Bangkok...

57
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,037
Who claim they've seen
American p.O.W.S in Laos.

58
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,840
I'll put you
in contact with them.

59
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:18,610
I think my son's being
held prisoner in Laos,

60
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,078
but I need proof.

61
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,081
Get my son's signature
on the back of this picture.

62
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,818
Get my son's signature
on the back of that picture.

63
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,054
Get him to
write his name on it.

64
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:33,859
If I get your son's name here,

65
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:37,129
I want a lots of money.

66
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:39,765
Yeah, o.K.

67
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:52,778
Hey, you.

68
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:16,868
Hey!

69
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:27,879
Oh, boy. There's that
old colonel m.I.A. Again.

70
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:29,881
Senator. Hello, colonel.

71
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:32,217
How are you? Fine, thanks.

72
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:34,619
Sorry we haven't
got time today,

73
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,789
but give me a ring in my office,
I'd be happy to talk to you.

74
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,891
Thank you. Sorry.

75
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,897
Colonel rhodes, I can't
help you with your son.

76
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:49,067
I'm trying to find food
for these new refugees.

77
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:51,636
Talk to that guy over there.
He'll help. Good luck.

78
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,672
Thank you very much.

79
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,094
That your boy. He
prisoner in camp in Laos.

80
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,864
I smuggled the picture out.
That's him.

81
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,721
I know my son's being held
someplace in northern Laos,

82
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:44,656
but I need to know
exactly where.

83
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:46,892
I need a thorough recon
of the area.

84
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:48,894
Man, that's tough.

85
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:52,564
Like I told you, I can go
into Laos and north Vietnam.

86
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:55,600
I've got the connections.

87
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:58,837
But it'll take a lot of
money to find your son.

88
00:08:58,839 --> 00:08:59,905
Don, hi!

89
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,873
How are you, Jason? Good. Good.

90
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,876
What do you have for me?

91
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:08,146
You know... If they
find out about this,

92
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,549
they'll retire me, just
like they retired you.

93
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,784
Yeah, yeah, o.K.

94
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:20,859
I suppose someone could
call this treason.

95
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:23,895
No. No, thanks.

96
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,267
It's a prison camp in Laos.

97
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:32,304
Look at the paddy dikes.

98
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:36,274
There's your proof, Jason.

99
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:38,243
There's your proof... 111.

100
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,779
You go get your boy.

101
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,929
All right. Now, where was I?

102
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:02,667
Hey, blaster, tell us about that time
you almost got wasted by that big wave.

103
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:05,604
I've told you guys
that story a thousand times.

104
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:08,940
I don't remember how I lied
the last time.

105
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,776
It doesn't matter. It's
still going to be bitchin'.

106
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,845
All right, all right.

107
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:17,949
The surf on the north shore comes
up real fast, out of nowhere.

108
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,952
You're out there in the
line-up having a good time,

109
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,954
and then it happens...

110
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,956
a life-threatening experience.

111
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,960
And then? Yeah. What
happens, blaster?

112
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:33,732
This photograph was taken somewhere
close to where Frank is being held.

113
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,700
I'm not saying
Frank is one of them,

114
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:37,736
but those two are Americans.

115
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:39,971
They're much too tall
to be vietnamese.

116
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,273
Average vietnamese man
is about 5'2-1/2".

117
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:44,376
Those two are Americans.

118
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:46,211
And that's supposed
to be Frank?

119
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:47,779
That is Frank.

120
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:50,982
I bought too many fakes
over the last 10 years.

121
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,984
That definitely is Frank.

122
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,987
Been a p.O.W. 10 years
in that shithole?

123
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,423
Listen, Frank is alive.

124
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:01,926
You got that? My son is alive.

125
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:04,729
Take a look at that.

126
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:07,866
That's a high-altitude
photograph taken from a sr-71.

127
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:09,334
Look at it closely.

128
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:14,673
See? Right here
in the paddy dikes.

129
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,743
The three lines there.

130
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:21,946
"111."

131
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,950
That's your old
lrrp team designation...

132
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:27,952
1st battalion, 11th infantry.
Recon team Arizona.

133
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:29,954
Don't you see it?

134
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:32,757
It's plain as day. There.
Yes. Right here.

135
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,959
That's three lines
in the ground.

136
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:38,697
It could be anything.

137
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,965
You know it isn't though,
don't you?

138
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:45,437
That's a message from my son.

139
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:48,973
You know that.

140
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:06,725
Hello.

141
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:07,859
Hi.

142
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:09,327
Mrs. Wilkes?

143
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:10,862
Yeah, that's right.

144
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:13,798
I'm Jason rhodes.

145
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,200
I phoned this morning.

146
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:17,902
Yeah, I know who you are.

147
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,872
Listen, my husband doesn't
want to talk to you.

148
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:22,941
I phoned him this morning,
and he said he did.

149
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:24,943
Yeah, well, not anymore.

150
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:28,947
Why don't you do me a
favor and go away?

151
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:31,950
Not until I see your husband.

152
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:34,486
You've got no right to be here.

153
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:36,421
It's taken me 10 years...

154
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:40,191
To get that goddamned war
out of his head.

155
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:43,228
Looks to me like
it's still in his head.

156
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,263
Ohh...

157
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,965
That's very deep.

158
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:49,234
Where were you all the days...

159
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:51,469
He spent staring at the walls?

160
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:54,372
Hey, wilkes!

161
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:55,540
Goddamn you!

162
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:57,509
Why did you send
your wife out here?

163
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:59,978
Don't you have
the guts to come out?

164
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,846
Leave him alone!

165
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:06,851
My son needs you! At least
look at our photographs.

166
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:10,822
Oh, please. Please, don't.

167
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:12,524
Wilkesy.

168
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:14,959
I'll handle this now.

169
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:27,872
I don't like your tactics.

170
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:30,408
But I'll listen
because of Frank.

171
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:35,213
Blaster.

172
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:39,851
Wilkesy.

173
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:41,953
Why didn't you stay in touch?

174
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:43,288
Why didn't you?

175
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,025
I don't know.

176
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:48,927
It's weird, ain't it?

177
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,031
How did they find you?

178
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:55,533
I don't know. Came
looking and found me.

179
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,468
Then we found you.

180
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:00,939
Thanks a lot, blast.

181
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:03,208
It's good to see you, man.

182
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:40,011
There are compounds
all over northern Laos.

183
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:42,247
There are choppers
we left behind.

184
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:45,283
We'll use them to get
into the p.O.W. Camp.

185
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:47,218
They're used all the time,

186
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,220
so they should be
well maintained.

187
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,222
Excuse me, please.

188
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:05,937
You going out? Mm-hmm.

189
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,405
Little early, isn't it?

190
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,007
I want to make happy hour.

191
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:11,009
Yeah.

192
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:13,278
Want to come along?

193
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,181
No. I think I'll
stay home tonight.

194
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:18,683
No kidding.

195
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,218
What's that mean?

196
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,687
It means, no kidding.

197
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:24,989
I don't feel like going out.

198
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:28,593
Well, you never do. He never
feels like doing anything.

199
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,261
That's not true.

200
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,430
Every night it's the same.

201
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,300
He puts on his headphones
and listens to that crap.

202
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:38,036
That crap happens
to be George gershwin.

203
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:42,040
Whatever. It's like
I'm not even here.

204
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:46,044
He's like a turtle
hiding in his shell.

205
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:50,014
He hasn't taken off those
sunglasses in six years.

206
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:54,419
I've given up trying
to figure him out.

207
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:04,462
Maybe you should take
him back to Vietnam.

208
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,999
He doesn't give a damn
about anything here.

209
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:10,201
It was nice meeting
you, colonel.

210
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:11,569
Nice meeting you.

211
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:16,708
If he did go,

212
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,543
how much would he be paid?

213
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:22,513
Nothing in dollars.

214
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,664
I haven't flown
a helicopter in a long time.

215
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,699
I'd probably get
somebody killed.

216
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:45,470
There's unfinished business
over there, major Johnson.

217
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:47,038
Not mine.

218
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:52,243
Is this the distinguished
flying cross?

219
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:53,711
Yeah.

220
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,246
How'd you get that?

221
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:59,283
Ah... Pulling a thud pilot
out of Laos.

222
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:01,652
Must have been
more to it than that.

223
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,121
Not really.

224
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:07,458
Tell me about it.
I'd like to hear it.

225
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,361
I got him out after a lot of
good people went down trying.

226
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:15,566
It was a hell of a day.

227
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,802
We'd already lost
a good man named Hendricks,

228
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:19,804
couple of f-4 jocks,

229
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:21,806
even Sandy low lead.

230
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:24,809
Lost a lot of good friends.

231
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:26,711
How many?

232
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,546
Oh, I don't remember.

233
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,581
It just seemed like everybody.

234
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,817
You lost 11 men and 9 aircraft.

235
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:36,454
You were shot down first, and you
volunteered to go back for that pilot.

236
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:37,622
Why?

237
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:39,657
If you know that, you tell me.

238
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:41,092
Why?

239
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:43,428
Because it was my job,
that's why!

240
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,798
We couldn't let good men
die for nothing!

241
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,833
That's why we're
going back now.

242
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:51,302
Wait! Back up!

243
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:54,839
You cannot lay
that guilt on me! No!

244
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:57,842
I'm sorry, but
the answer is no.

245
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,714
What do you want from me?

246
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:05,817
I run half this hospital.

247
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:08,186
I lead a good life here.

248
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:10,388
I'm off to Bermuda next week...

249
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,790
And not off to
some fantasy war.

250
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:15,793
I cannot save
the goddamn world!

251
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:18,396
At ease, major.

252
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:22,834
<i>Macgregor oil.</i>

253
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:24,602
Mr. Macgregor, please.

254
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,837
<i>Mr. Macgregor's office.</i>

255
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,639
This is Jason rhodes calling.

256
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:30,741
Jason, how's it going?

257
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:32,677
We're on our way.

258
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:34,312
How many?

259
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:37,715
Three. One chopper
pilot turned me down.

260
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,484
Is two enough?

261
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:42,854
I'll do it with one
if I have to.

262
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:44,856
I can't turn back now.

263
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:47,758
Is there anything
more I can do?

264
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,627
Just keep the cash coming.

265
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,863
I'll get our boys back.

266
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:54,265
Jason, what about sailor?

267
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:57,568
He's in Houston.
I'm going there now.

268
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,572
The replica of the p.O.W.
Camp is ready.

269
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:04,575
Great. Keep in touch.

270
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:06,811
All right. Talk to you.

271
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,779
Don't worry. He can't see you.

272
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:10,248
It's a two-way mirror.

273
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,655
Your friend, sailor,

274
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,358
blowtorched
a local kingpin biker.

275
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,262
We're holding him on our
witness protection program.

276
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:28,466
He come in here with a
grenade around his neck.

277
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:30,635
I don't think his
bread's quite done.

278
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:33,838
Jesus.

279
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,846
I had trouble
tracking you down.

280
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:44,815
You wandered around
the whole country.

281
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:48,352
Frank mentioned you
in his letters.

282
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,655
He said you were the
best man in the unit.

283
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:53,324
Yeah? What the hell
happened to you?

284
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:01,299
I'm so far beyond
that shit now.

285
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:03,301
I get energy from the air.

286
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:06,537
I talk to polar bears.
I converse with paramecium.

287
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,307
Man, I fuck nuclear waste!

288
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:12,743
Shit.

289
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,818
You guys will be
using real grenades.

290
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,587
They took mine.

291
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:23,888
Hey, look, asshole.

292
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:27,625
This is not
a biker's acid trip.

293
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:30,695
This is a precise
military operation.

294
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:34,332
Frank was the best man
in anybody's unit.

295
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:36,567
I've got enough brain
cells to remember that.

296
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:44,875
You've got to
give me a shot, man.

297
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:46,611
You've got to.

298
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,648
Hey, wilkesy.

299
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,588
Aw, man. Come on.

300
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,261
Sailor?

301
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:04,695
Ya-hoo!

302
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:09,467
My man! Blaster!

303
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:13,771
You haven't changed a bit!

304
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,406
Master wilkes!

305
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:16,774
Where's your grenade?

306
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,910
I used that for
an emergency enema.

307
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:29,820
Maybe I do have a little
unfinished business.

308
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:33,491
Besides, this guy wouldn't
last 10 minutes without me.

309
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,960
You ain't bullshitting.

310
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,763
Get aboard.

311
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:08,926
Gentlemen, this is it.

312
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:11,662
Exact replica
of the p.O.W. Camp.

313
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,564
Who built it?

314
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:14,899
Macgregor's father.

315
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:17,501
Get your gear.
Stow it in that large tent.

316
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,937
I'll meet you here
in an hour for supper.

317
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:28,946
Mr. Ky, supper in one hour.

318
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:31,582
Thank you.

319
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:42,760
Mr. Scott, at ease.

320
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:47,465
So, who the hell is that?

321
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:54,772
Good evening.

322
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:56,874
Hi. How are you?

323
00:22:56,876 --> 00:23:00,778
Mr. Ky, you can serve
when you're ready.

324
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:04,382
Good evening.

325
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:06,484
As you were.

326
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:09,754
Since military courtesy isn't practical
here, we'll dispense with it.

327
00:23:09,756 --> 00:23:11,622
This is Kevin Scott.

328
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:15,893
He's well-trained in weapons
and training techniques.

329
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,396
And this is Mr. ky.

330
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:21,932
We'll be eating vietnamese
food from now on.

331
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:25,936
We don't want to smell
like Americans.

332
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:29,407
Any questions?

333
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:30,574
Good.

334
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:33,177
How long were you there?

335
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:34,812
I wasn't.

336
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:36,414
Too young.

337
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,950
Is he going with us?

338
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:43,454
Served in fourth recon marines.

339
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:44,955
Served?

340
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:48,959
I was discharged for
striking a radio operator...

341
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:51,162
Who fell asleep at his post.

342
00:23:56,702 --> 00:24:00,438
You're worried that I have
no combat experience.

343
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,806
You're right.

344
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:03,774
There's no way of proving...

345
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,644
I won't fail in combat.

346
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:08,946
But you can't prove
that I will, either.

347
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:14,585
This is gonna be...

348
00:24:14,587 --> 00:24:17,121
A whole lot of fun
with this one.

349
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:20,724
Gentlemen.

350
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,964
Thank you for coming.

351
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,667
I knew you would come,

352
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:32,570
'cause you men
have got what it takes.

353
00:24:32,572 --> 00:24:35,973
Molded over a little,
but you still got it.

354
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:41,579
There's a bond
between you men...

355
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:45,983
As strong as the bond
between my son and me.

356
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:48,986
Of course, men who faced
death in battle...

357
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,988
Share the strongest bond.

358
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:55,993
You men seem to have
a strong sense of loyalty...

359
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:58,996
Because you're thought
of as criminals...

360
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,998
Because of Vietnam.

361
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,801
You know why?

362
00:25:03,803 --> 00:25:05,903
Hmm?

363
00:25:05,905 --> 00:25:07,938
Because you lost.

364
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,741
And in this country,

365
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:12,743
that's like going bankrupt.

366
00:25:12,745 --> 00:25:14,712
You're out of business.

367
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:16,780
They want to forget about you.

368
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:19,783
You cost too much
and didn't turn a profit.

369
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:22,753
That's why they
won't get our buddies.

370
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:24,955
There's no gain in it.

371
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:29,960
We know the books
are still in the red.

372
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:32,162
The politicians know, too.

373
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:34,198
The same politicians...

374
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,935
That never lost a son
in Vietnam. Not one!

375
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:40,804
They say they've negotiated
for 10 years,

376
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:42,206
well...

377
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:47,778
The other side's not buying.

378
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:52,950
And while the politicians
sit on their asses,

379
00:25:52,952 --> 00:25:55,986
I'm asking you
to lay yours on the line.

380
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:58,222
Again.

381
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,693
Because, gentlemen...

382
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,931
We're the only hope
those p.O.W.S have.

383
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:12,836
So, we're going back there.

384
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:15,906
And this time...

385
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,275
This time,
nobody can dispute...

386
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:20,978
The rightness
of what we're doing.

387
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:33,624
Hit the dirt!

388
00:26:35,728 --> 00:26:37,661
Get down!

389
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:39,997
You're all dead.

390
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:41,865
Not quite, sir.

391
00:26:56,782 --> 00:27:00,184
Go, colonel! Go, go, go!

392
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:01,819
Go, colonel. Go, go, go!

393
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:03,721
Go! Go! Go!

394
00:27:03,723 --> 00:27:05,956
Move it! Move it! Move it!

395
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,691
Go! Go! Go!

396
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:10,194
Fuckin' pimp!

397
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15,966
Go! Go! Go!

398
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,901
Blaster, go! Come on, baby, go!

399
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,974
Come on, man.

400
00:27:25,378 --> 00:27:27,378
Come on, sailor! Take it home!

401
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,647
Come on, Scott.

402
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:32,349
Go! Go, sailor, go!

403
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:33,984
Come on, rookie!

404
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,686
All right, come on!

405
00:27:35,688 --> 00:27:37,688
Go! Go, sailor!

406
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,660
Hit it!

407
00:27:51,237 --> 00:27:53,804
What are you doing?

408
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:59,009
You don't ever quit, boy.

409
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,211
Not when it's for real.

410
00:28:02,815 --> 00:28:03,947
All right. That's enough.

411
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:09,787
Aw, shit!

412
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:10,954
Damn!

413
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:12,956
Little too much civilian life.

414
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,358
Pull it in!

415
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:17,961
O.K.! Move your butts!

416
00:28:17,963 --> 00:28:19,396
Double time!

417
00:28:24,837 --> 00:28:26,303
Good shooting, colonel.

418
00:28:26,305 --> 00:28:27,871
Blaster, your elbow down.

419
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,473
Yeah, yeah.

420
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:32,443
Sailor, stop spraying!

421
00:28:32,445 --> 00:28:34,344
Conserve your ammo!

422
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:43,987
You haven't got
one in the kill zone!

423
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:46,423
These hands were made to fly.

424
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:49,393
Tell the enemy when he
blows your head off!

425
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:51,829
Kill the enemy!

426
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:53,263
Don't lose it, mister!

427
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:55,999
You kill the fuckin' enemy,
asshole!

428
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:58,202
Sailor, I could teach...

429
00:28:58,204 --> 00:29:01,839
An undisciplined brawler
like you a lesson.

430
00:29:01,841 --> 00:29:03,807
Make your move, boy.

431
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:05,776
Scott! A word, please.

432
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:12,916
Scott, these men
are seasoned veterans.

433
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:15,285
They can't be treated
like raw recruits.

434
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:17,287
You have to earn their respect.

435
00:29:21,327 --> 00:29:22,926
Yes, sir.

436
00:29:53,993 --> 00:29:56,560
Wilkesy's
claustrophobic as shit.

437
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,064
He was the tunnel
rat in our unit.

438
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:03,066
Goes down this tunnel...

439
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:05,235
To check for weapon storage.

440
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:08,071
Turns out there's
somebody down there.

441
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:10,941
He knifes them both
in the dark.

442
00:30:10,943 --> 00:30:13,043
Then the mortar shells hit.

443
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:16,847
He's stuck until
we dig him out.

444
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:19,082
Wilkes lights a match...

445
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:23,020
To move the bodies off of him.

446
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:26,089
He'd knifed some
woman and her kid.

447
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:28,091
Killed them deader than shit.

448
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:30,861
Jesus.

449
00:30:30,863 --> 00:30:32,963
Wilkes starts freaking.

450
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:35,332
We can hear him screaming,

451
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,968
but he has to stay
with those corpses...

452
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:41,572
Until we dig him out.

453
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:45,943
You come in low under
his line of sight.

454
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:51,114
You leap, taking him down,

455
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:54,117
placing your hand over his
nose, pulling his face away.

456
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:57,120
At the base of his skull,
to the right of the spine,

457
00:30:57,122 --> 00:31:00,123
into what the Chinese
call the "wind gate,"

458
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:03,060
you insert, scramble the
brains... instant rag doll.

459
00:31:03,062 --> 00:31:05,495
Most human problems
can be solved...

460
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:08,065
By a charge of high-explosives.

461
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:10,067
In today's lesson,

462
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:13,070
we'll learn to set what we
call a series or a break.

463
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:16,306
Follow me. My personal
best is a break of six.

464
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:19,343
The idea is to create
a linked series of disasters.

465
00:31:19,345 --> 00:31:21,345
Figure evasive moves
from each blast,

466
00:31:21,347 --> 00:31:23,647
and plant your next tomato.

467
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:26,516
Just as we're coming up here
with a column,

468
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:29,620
they'd trip charge number one,
an m-26 trip grenade.

469
00:31:29,622 --> 00:31:31,355
Boom!

470
00:31:31,357 --> 00:31:34,091
Column splits in two.
Half here, half there.

471
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:39,062
Over here, number two will
set their ass on fire.

472
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:41,098
They think they're safe.
They get away!

473
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:46,103
Boom! Number three
blows their balls off.

474
00:31:46,105 --> 00:31:48,906
Number four!
They come over here.

475
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:52,109
They find
a two-pound charge of c-4.

476
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:54,011
Boom!

477
00:31:54,013 --> 00:31:57,114
Number five.
Quick-fuse grenade.

478
00:31:57,116 --> 00:31:59,616
Not a big bang,
but it does a good job.

479
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:04,488
Anybody left will think,
"we've got to make it."

480
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,490
They're coming out,
and they're moving,

481
00:32:06,492 --> 00:32:09,359
and then they run
into charge six.

482
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:12,095
Claymore mine. End of story.

483
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:26,310
Congratulations, sailor.
You wasted a prisoner.

484
00:32:28,314 --> 00:32:29,980
He's a collaborator.

485
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:41,124
You all right?

486
00:32:45,431 --> 00:32:48,031
Can't sleep, huh?

487
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:56,473
For years I couldn't
sleep after Korea.

488
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:02,279
My nightmares all had to do
with the chosin reservoir.

489
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:05,415
The ground there
was so frozen...

490
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:07,985
We couldn't bury our dead.

491
00:33:07,987 --> 00:33:11,455
Piled them on trucks and
lashed them against the tanks.

492
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:18,428
For years I'd wake up with those
frozen faces staring at me.

493
00:33:23,102 --> 00:33:26,103
Did it ever go away?

494
00:33:26,105 --> 00:33:27,704
No.

495
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:34,044
I finally made friends
with them though.

496
00:33:38,384 --> 00:33:39,383
No.

497
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:40,384
Left.

498
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:41,418
No.

499
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,120
Left, right, left.

500
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:44,554
No.

501
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:47,057
Get together, guys!

502
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:49,092
Gentlemen!

503
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:51,595
The object
of the next exercise...

504
00:33:51,597 --> 00:33:54,131
get from here to the bridge...

505
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:56,366
Without being tagged by wilkes.

506
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:06,376
God damn it! Shit.

507
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:09,780
Sneaky little shit.

508
00:34:19,792 --> 00:34:22,692
Aw, shit. I'm dead.

509
00:34:22,694 --> 00:34:24,728
Wilkesy, I'm supposed... shit!

510
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,770
Aah!

511
00:34:38,644 --> 00:34:40,110
Shit!

512
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:05,502
Fuck, man.

513
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:14,111
Come on!

514
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:17,114
Come on. Come on. Come on.

515
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:19,716
You can make it. Come across.

516
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:23,120
You people got caught
'cause you got careless!

517
00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:25,288
I told you...

518
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:28,525
All right, wilkesy!

519
00:35:28,527 --> 00:35:29,893
All right, wilkesy!

520
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:33,530
The object of the exercise
was not to get caught!

521
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:49,446
That guy's elevator
doesn't go to the top.

522
00:35:49,448 --> 00:35:51,781
Agent orange.

523
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:54,551
No. Red wine and uppers.

524
00:35:54,553 --> 00:35:56,453
That's why he's called sailor.

525
00:35:56,455 --> 00:36:00,724
He'd take red wine and
uppers, and just sail away.

526
00:36:00,726 --> 00:36:03,793
How come he wears that grenade?

527
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:05,896
Sailor says if life got shitty,

528
00:36:05,898 --> 00:36:07,831
he'd pull the pin
and see what's next.

529
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,574
Wilkesy, remember that song?

530
00:36:19,912 --> 00:36:21,912
Get down, boogie,
remember? Yeah!

531
00:36:21,914 --> 00:36:23,713
Boogie! Come on.

532
00:36:25,184 --> 00:36:27,918
Come on, remember that?
Come on, wilkesy.

533
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,519
Hey, blaster.

534
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,688
Yeah! Come on!

535
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:35,525
Come on, Johnson! Get out here.

536
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:36,726
Come on, Johnson!

537
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:38,562
Go for it!

538
00:36:38,564 --> 00:36:39,930
Do it, boy!

539
00:36:42,935 --> 00:36:47,771
<i>¶ I'll stay with you,</i>
<i>darling, now ¶</i>

540
00:36:47,773 --> 00:36:52,709
<i>¶ I'll stay with you</i>
<i>till my seeds are dried up ¶</i>

541
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:00,584
agent orange.

542
00:37:00,586 --> 00:37:02,919
All agent orange.

543
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:04,654
<i>¶ ...waiting so long ¶</i>

544
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:08,625
<i>¶ to be where I'm going ¶</i>

545
00:37:08,627 --> 00:37:14,931
<i>¶ in the sunshine</i>
<i>of your love ¶¶</i>

546
00:37:28,981 --> 00:37:31,648
o.K., Curtis.
Follow the leader.

547
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,883
Sounds good to me.

548
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:35,986
Close it up!

549
00:37:35,988 --> 00:37:38,455
Let's go! Fly this thing!

550
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,995
Get your Sierra
together, my man.

551
00:37:44,997 --> 00:37:47,731
Kiss my Sierra, buddy.

552
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:49,866
You were the ace of the base.

553
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:52,769
Getting too old
for this shit, buddy?

554
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:00,677
Looking good, guys.
Looking good.

555
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,514
Left, right, left.

556
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:07,651
Left, left, left, right, left.

557
00:38:07,653 --> 00:38:10,920
Son of a bitch! Shit!

558
00:38:12,357 --> 00:38:14,491
What the fuck am I doing here?

559
00:38:14,493 --> 00:38:15,959
Come on! Don't quit!

560
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:18,561
Fuck you!

561
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:20,964
We have to work
together... everybody!

562
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:25,735
I don't believe
this motherfuckin' shit!

563
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:28,638
I've been workin'
my fuckin' ass off,

564
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,974
and I don't need
no wet-nosed asshole...

565
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:31,975
Screaming in my face!

566
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:34,377
Back off!

567
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:37,414
Curtis! Let the shit ride!

568
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:39,849
What matters is
we're on the same team!

569
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:41,785
We have to work together!

570
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:46,990
We<i> are</i> the team, asshole.

571
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,992
We were there, not you.

572
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:13,950
Now, asshole.

573
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:16,519
Right now!

574
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:21,391
Sailor, colonel rhodes
was wrong.

575
00:39:23,729 --> 00:39:26,363
I can't earn your respect,

576
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:28,798
'cause you have no
respect for yourself.

577
00:39:29,935 --> 00:39:31,735
Boy...

578
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:36,606
You just bought the whole
can of whoop-ass.

579
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:39,976
Come on, sailor!

580
00:39:39,978 --> 00:39:43,413
Kick his ass, sailor!

581
00:39:50,422 --> 00:39:54,624
Boy, using that oriental
martial bullshit on me...

582
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:56,726
Is going to get real expensive.

583
00:40:18,784 --> 00:40:21,484
Get up! Come on, hero!

584
00:40:21,486 --> 00:40:22,519
That's enough, sailor!

585
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:25,522
Get up, boy! Come on!

586
00:40:25,524 --> 00:40:28,491
You can't keep me
from this mission!

587
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,931
Why are you getting up, marine?

588
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,534
Stay down, man.

589
00:40:37,536 --> 00:40:38,935
Stay down, little fucker!

590
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,937
No. No!

591
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:43,873
Why you wanna go die, boy?

592
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:44,941
Why?

593
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,176
Why?

594
00:40:46,178 --> 00:40:48,912
I'll tell you why.

595
00:40:48,914 --> 00:40:50,947
His father's
missing in action...

596
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,616
Shot down in Vietnam,
that's why.

597
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:48,538
Blaster, when I come
over the treeline...

598
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,840
At 0300,

599
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:54,978
that's your cue to blow up
the radio tower,

600
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:58,982
then the bridge to cut off
reinforcements from the village.

601
00:41:58,984 --> 00:42:00,984
Boom.

602
00:42:00,986 --> 00:42:03,620
Mister Scott,
that's your cue...

603
00:42:03,622 --> 00:42:05,922
To neutralize guard tower "a".

604
00:42:05,924 --> 00:42:09,125
All right, charts, Johnson...

605
00:42:09,127 --> 00:42:12,562
You pick up blaster after
we've snatched the prisoners.

606
00:42:12,564 --> 00:42:15,298
Major Johnson,
you pick up Scott.

607
00:42:18,937 --> 00:42:21,538
O.K., blaster,
this is the big ride.

608
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,940
All right, sailor!

609
00:42:23,942 --> 00:42:27,777
Gentlemen, study every
inch of this compound.

610
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:31,948
It's an exact reproduction
of the p.O.W. Camp in Laos.

611
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:34,684
It's imperative
that we're in and out...

612
00:42:34,686 --> 00:42:36,719
In less than three minutes.

613
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:40,823
The lives of everyone
involved may depend on it.

614
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:44,894
We're rehearsing so we can
do this operation in our sleep.

615
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:48,197
We gotta be in and out
of there in 3 minutes.

616
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:51,834
10 days time, we'll have
a live fire exercise.

617
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:56,873
Look, we have been pursuing
diplomatic negotiations...

618
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:58,975
For the release of all p.O.W.S,

619
00:42:58,977 --> 00:43:00,977
if there are any.

620
00:43:00,979 --> 00:43:02,946
An armed incursion now...

621
00:43:02,948 --> 00:43:05,348
Would undermine
those negotiations.

622
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:07,951
Negotiations?
It's been 10 years!

623
00:43:07,953 --> 00:43:10,820
They'll be dead
by the time you negotiate!

624
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:13,222
Damn it, as my friend,

625
00:43:13,224 --> 00:43:16,326
call rhodes
and drop this project!

626
00:43:27,172 --> 00:43:31,975
Look, I didn't
want it to get this far.

627
00:43:31,977 --> 00:43:34,844
You know, they're prepared
to take serious measures...

628
00:43:34,846 --> 00:43:36,980
Against your company...

629
00:43:36,982 --> 00:43:38,982
I.R.S. Audits,

630
00:43:38,984 --> 00:43:41,384
anti-trust suits...

631
00:43:43,388 --> 00:43:46,155
Fuck you, art.

632
00:43:48,193 --> 00:43:50,994
The men we're going after
will be in rough shape...

633
00:43:50,996 --> 00:43:52,996
Something like these men.

634
00:43:52,998 --> 00:43:56,866
They may not be able to walk.

635
00:43:56,868 --> 00:43:59,869
They may not want to walk.

636
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:02,138
They will be shattered...

637
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,940
Both physically...

638
00:44:03,942 --> 00:44:06,943
And emotionally.

639
00:44:06,945 --> 00:44:10,380
After all these years, they may
not be able to speak English.

640
00:44:10,382 --> 00:44:13,750
Remember, gentlemen,
everything we do tonight...

641
00:44:13,752 --> 00:44:16,352
Is motivated by them.

642
00:47:58,443 --> 00:48:00,877
It looked like
the fourth of July!

643
00:48:00,879 --> 00:48:04,280
It was beautiful!
It was gorgeous!

644
00:48:04,282 --> 00:48:06,015
Gentlemen!

645
00:48:07,018 --> 00:48:08,551
Mr. Macgregor.

646
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:11,287
I wanted to
thank you personally.

647
00:48:11,289 --> 00:48:12,955
After watching you,

648
00:48:12,957 --> 00:48:17,927
I know Jason's chosen
the right men for the job.

649
00:48:17,929 --> 00:48:21,030
And as a token of my esteem,

650
00:48:21,032 --> 00:48:23,232
a check and
pocket money for Bangkok.

651
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:24,934
Nah. That's all right.

652
00:48:24,936 --> 00:48:26,369
Take it.

653
00:48:26,371 --> 00:48:27,970
Thank you.

654
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:31,007
Thank you, sir.

655
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:40,049
Thank you.

656
00:48:59,003 --> 00:49:03,205
Do you ever regret
letting Frank go, Jason?

657
00:49:03,207 --> 00:49:07,209
He was in the service. There
wasn't any question of him going.

658
00:49:07,211 --> 00:49:10,613
Couldn't your Washington contacts
get him stationed elsewhere?

659
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:13,616
When there's a war,
the rhodes fight it.

660
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:18,020
We lost almost the whole
family at gettysburg one day.

661
00:49:18,022 --> 00:49:19,956
That's all we're good at.

662
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:22,959
Haven't always been real
good at fighting, either.

663
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:28,230
A lot of us been killed.

664
00:49:33,504 --> 00:49:36,038
But we're always there.

665
00:49:37,675 --> 00:49:40,276
You know, Jason...

666
00:49:41,612 --> 00:49:44,280
I'd give everything
I have... everything...

667
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:49,051
For just one hour with him.

668
00:50:27,592 --> 00:50:30,092
See if that's our truck.

669
00:50:52,116 --> 00:50:55,251
There's a c.I.A. Man
if I've ever seen one.

670
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:10,833
Johnson, rhodes...

671
00:51:10,835 --> 00:51:12,568
You're in a shit pile
of trouble.

672
00:51:15,206 --> 00:51:17,206
We're confiscating
your weapons.

673
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:20,843
My orders are to put you
in jail... a Bangkok jail.

674
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:24,847
I don't want to put
an old soldier like you in jail,

675
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:28,417
but damn it,
this scheme of yours is crazy.

676
00:51:30,488 --> 00:51:32,855
Shit!

677
00:51:32,857 --> 00:51:35,224
You'd best be
on the next plane home.

678
00:51:35,226 --> 00:51:37,226
And don't go back to the hotel.

679
00:51:37,228 --> 00:51:39,428
They're waiting
for your ass there, too.

680
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:42,631
Since our government's
confiscated our weapons,

681
00:51:42,633 --> 00:51:45,601
I'm not going to ask
you gentlemen to go any further.

682
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:47,870
It's over!

683
00:51:47,872 --> 00:51:50,573
I'm not giving up
to those bastards.

684
00:51:50,575 --> 00:51:54,210
My son Frank's waiting for me.

685
00:51:54,212 --> 00:51:56,679
I'll go in there
with a pocketknife!

686
00:51:56,681 --> 00:52:00,182
You people do whatever
you want, o.K.?

687
00:52:02,186 --> 00:52:05,187
There's got to be someplace
in Bangkok to get guns.

688
00:52:05,189 --> 00:52:07,723
No. Up north in
the golden triangle.

689
00:52:07,725 --> 00:52:09,692
We need money for that!

690
00:52:09,694 --> 00:52:11,794
What about the c.I.A.?

691
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:15,164
Who cares? It's
a total wipe-out!

692
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:17,700
We've got money.

693
00:52:23,508 --> 00:52:25,307
That's right.

694
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:27,309
The money macgregor gave us.

695
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:29,478
Everybody give it up.

696
00:52:32,283 --> 00:52:34,316
Come on, all of it.

697
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,318
That's all I got.

698
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,287
What you been doin'?

699
00:52:38,289 --> 00:52:40,523
Seeing the sights.

700
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:44,260
Wilkes, we're going
to need transportation.

701
00:52:44,262 --> 00:52:46,262
4-wheel drive?

702
00:52:46,264 --> 00:52:48,264
Preferably.

703
00:52:48,266 --> 00:52:50,466
Buy it or borrow it?

704
00:52:50,468 --> 00:52:52,201
Steal the fucker!

705
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:56,272
Left. Left!

706
00:53:59,804 --> 00:54:01,837
Hey!

707
00:54:17,321 --> 00:54:19,321
Some other fella's moved in
on your man's drug operation.

708
00:54:19,323 --> 00:54:21,323
Even moved into his house.

709
00:54:21,325 --> 00:54:23,325
We can find
him down the street.

710
00:54:45,016 --> 00:54:47,016
Colonel rhodes.

711
00:54:47,018 --> 00:54:49,018
Sit down.

712
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:51,287
Jiang, how are you?

713
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:53,022
I understand you've
had some trouble.

714
00:54:53,024 --> 00:54:56,325
The misfortunes of
the narcotics world.

715
00:54:56,327 --> 00:54:58,627
I barely escaped
with my life...

716
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:00,629
And nothing else.

717
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:03,332
Do you still have men
to take us into northern Laos?

718
00:55:03,334 --> 00:55:05,534
I'll take you myself.

719
00:55:05,536 --> 00:55:08,837
I'm weary of this
life of uselessness.

720
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:11,640
Jiang, we need weapons.

721
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:14,343
We need cheap weapons now.

722
00:55:14,345 --> 00:55:17,346
We lost ours in
Bangkok, understand?

723
00:55:17,348 --> 00:55:20,916
No, we don't have time to eat.

724
00:55:20,918 --> 00:55:24,320
I'll bet you'll approve
of our cuisine.

725
00:55:24,322 --> 00:55:28,090
At this restaurant,
you can eat well or poorly,

726
00:55:28,092 --> 00:55:31,727
depending on how
you order your meal.

727
00:55:38,369 --> 00:55:40,569
What does monsieur recommend?

728
00:55:40,571 --> 00:55:43,105
All our cuisine is exceptional.

729
00:55:43,107 --> 00:55:45,974
But there are
seasonal specials.

730
00:55:50,815 --> 00:55:52,781
$5,000.

731
00:55:54,819 --> 00:55:56,819
$4,000.

732
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:02,958
$3,000.

733
00:56:04,962 --> 00:56:07,129
These dishes require...

734
00:56:07,131 --> 00:56:09,965
24-hour notice.

735
00:56:11,602 --> 00:56:15,137
Monsieur, these entrees
are too rich for our blood.

736
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:19,141
Come on.

737
00:56:27,151 --> 00:56:29,151
Uncle mich!

738
00:56:29,153 --> 00:56:30,786
Brother bud!

739
00:56:31,822 --> 00:56:34,923
Sorry. The wrong department.

740
00:56:34,925 --> 00:56:37,159
Bargain basement's this way.

741
00:56:37,161 --> 00:56:39,795
How much for the beer?

742
00:56:39,797 --> 00:56:41,797
Compliments of the house.

743
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,653
Ah, yes.

744
00:57:04,655 --> 00:57:08,991
I'll give you the whole
lot for let's say...

745
00:57:08,993 --> 00:57:10,092
No.

746
00:57:10,094 --> 00:57:11,560
$6,000.

747
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:14,663
Let's say $4,000.

748
00:57:14,665 --> 00:57:16,698
You're cheap.

749
00:57:18,702 --> 00:57:19,835
Garbage.

750
00:57:34,652 --> 00:57:35,951
Thank you.

751
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:39,621
High and to the right.

752
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:41,657
High and to the right.

753
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:49,965
Hit. Hit.

754
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:51,133
Hit.

755
00:57:59,076 --> 00:58:00,142
Gentlemen,

756
00:58:00,144 --> 00:58:02,544
these are my daughters.

757
00:58:02,546 --> 00:58:06,148
They will accompany
us into Laos.

758
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:10,152
Unfortunately, I have
no sons to offer you.

759
00:58:10,154 --> 00:58:15,157
They were killed by Laotian
red guards during opium run.

760
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:16,825
However, colonel rhodes,

761
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:21,163
I am certain my daughters
will prove themselves worthy.

762
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:28,837
O.K., let's go, gentlemen.

763
00:58:39,783 --> 00:58:41,750
We're back.

764
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:08,670
I'm just trying to stay warm.

765
01:00:08,672 --> 01:00:10,706
I swear to God.

766
01:01:05,429 --> 01:01:07,195
Jiang.

767
01:01:07,197 --> 01:01:08,830
Jiang.

768
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:10,899
What happened here?

769
01:01:10,901 --> 01:01:12,200
<i>Y pres.</i>

770
01:01:12,202 --> 01:01:13,435
What?

771
01:01:13,437 --> 01:01:15,103
<i>Y pres.</i>

772
01:01:15,105 --> 01:01:17,439
What's he talking about?

773
01:01:17,441 --> 01:01:18,774
It's French.

774
01:01:18,776 --> 01:01:20,776
A town in France.

775
01:01:20,778 --> 01:01:25,213
The first place the Germans
ever used mustard gas.

776
01:01:25,215 --> 01:01:26,815
Oh, yeah.

777
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:33,021
Yellow rain.

778
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:34,923
Hmong people fight vietnamese.

779
01:01:34,925 --> 01:01:36,224
Vietnamese hate them.

780
01:01:42,099 --> 01:01:43,932
Laotian border patrol.

781
01:01:43,934 --> 01:01:46,935
Get the recoilless
rifle right now.

782
01:01:55,079 --> 01:01:58,213
He thinks we're opium dealers.

783
01:01:58,215 --> 01:02:00,215
They want our cargo.

784
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:04,219
Offer him a bribe.
Anything. Stall.

785
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:07,222
They want to inspect our packs.

786
01:02:09,827 --> 01:02:12,894
This'll get terminal
in a hurry.

787
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:15,263
You ready, Johnson? Ready.

788
01:02:44,962 --> 01:02:46,528
Now!

789
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:05,881
Scott, God damn it,
man your weapon!

790
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:43,585
Damn it!

791
01:03:43,587 --> 01:03:46,188
Two of them got away!

792
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:47,589
Colonel.

793
01:04:15,085 --> 01:04:18,954
Sir, we lost one rpg,

794
01:04:18,956 --> 01:04:20,288
six grenades,

795
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:23,124
and a radio is damaged.

796
01:04:23,126 --> 01:04:25,994
It'll receive,
but the transmitter's shot.

797
01:04:34,004 --> 01:04:35,303
Mr. Jiang.

798
01:04:36,907 --> 01:04:38,306
We...

799
01:04:38,308 --> 01:04:39,908
Come.

800
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:41,943
We must continue on.

801
01:04:41,945 --> 01:04:46,114
No further words are
necessary, colonel rhodes.

802
01:04:55,092 --> 01:04:58,526
Since we don't have
night vision gear,

803
01:04:58,528 --> 01:05:02,130
we'll change to 0600
instead of 0300.

804
01:05:02,132 --> 01:05:05,033
We're able to receive
your verification...

805
01:05:05,035 --> 01:05:06,635
About the p.O.W.S,

806
01:05:06,637 --> 01:05:11,139
but you'll have to assume
we've gotten the choppers.

807
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:14,175
Wait till you hear us coming.

808
01:05:14,177 --> 01:05:17,145
Ground team,
you're up that trail.

809
01:05:17,147 --> 01:05:20,548
Air team,
follow me down this creek.

810
01:05:22,152 --> 01:05:23,952
Well, that's it.

811
01:05:25,289 --> 01:05:26,988
It's game time.

812
01:05:29,059 --> 01:05:31,993
I've forgotten
the speech I prepared.

813
01:05:31,995 --> 01:05:35,297
There are some lines
from<i> Julius Caesar.</i>

814
01:05:35,299 --> 01:05:37,565
"If a man were to know...

815
01:05:37,567 --> 01:05:41,036
"The end of this day's
business ere it come,

816
01:05:41,038 --> 01:05:45,073
"but it suffices
that the day will end,

817
01:05:45,075 --> 01:05:47,442
"and then the end be known.

818
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:49,544
"If we meet again,

819
01:05:49,546 --> 01:05:51,079
"then we'll smile.

820
01:05:51,081 --> 01:05:52,514
"And if not...

821
01:05:52,516 --> 01:05:56,117
Well, then,
this parting was well made."

822
01:07:18,802 --> 01:07:21,302
It should be
right over that hill.

823
01:07:28,678 --> 01:07:30,278
Come on.

824
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:32,113
Quietly.

825
01:07:32,115 --> 01:07:33,314
Down.

826
01:07:33,316 --> 01:07:35,083
Drop your packs.

827
01:08:14,758 --> 01:08:16,324
It looks deserted.

828
01:08:18,328 --> 01:08:20,862
You think they moved them?

829
01:08:20,864 --> 01:08:22,330
Quite possible.

830
01:08:22,332 --> 01:08:25,333
Rice down there
has been harvested.

831
01:08:28,138 --> 01:08:30,238
I'll take a look.

832
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:33,341
I'll look at that bridge.

833
01:09:43,313 --> 01:09:45,847
Couldn't find a way in.

834
01:09:45,849 --> 01:09:47,815
It's walled all around.

835
01:09:47,817 --> 01:09:49,284
Look at this.

836
01:09:49,286 --> 01:09:50,318
What?

837
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:58,860
O.K., wilkesy, I'll go.

838
01:09:58,862 --> 01:10:00,528
No, no, no.

839
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,897
I'll be waiting for you...

840
01:10:02,899 --> 01:10:04,866
When you come out.

841
01:10:04,868 --> 01:10:06,334
O.K., wilkesy?

842
01:10:10,207 --> 01:10:12,907
Take this. It'll
help protect you.

843
01:11:06,363 --> 01:11:07,895
Help!

844
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:12,834
Wilkesy, you all right?

845
01:11:18,375 --> 01:11:20,375
What's wrong, man?

846
01:11:38,928 --> 01:11:41,396
It's o.K. It's not poisonous.

847
01:11:41,398 --> 01:11:43,364
Yeah.

848
01:11:43,366 --> 01:11:45,767
That charm took care of you.

849
01:12:11,428 --> 01:12:13,428
I don't believe it!

850
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:15,863
The chopper compound
isn't here.

851
01:12:15,865 --> 01:12:19,867
They must have moved
the goddamn thing.

852
01:12:19,869 --> 01:12:22,003
Give me the map.

853
01:12:31,381 --> 01:12:32,747
Cover!

854
01:12:47,097 --> 01:12:48,863
All right, let's go.

855
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:50,365
Let's move.

856
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:31,199
Laotian regulars.

857
01:14:36,473 --> 01:14:38,473
Prisoners.

858
01:14:38,475 --> 01:14:41,709
They must've been working
across the river.

859
01:14:41,711 --> 01:14:43,644
That's why we didn't see them.

860
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,066
Jesus, wilkes!

861
01:15:39,068 --> 01:15:40,668
He spotted me.

862
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:43,070
You almost got me spotted.

863
01:15:43,072 --> 01:15:45,072
I saw an American.

864
01:15:45,074 --> 01:15:46,707
I saw three.

865
01:15:57,153 --> 01:15:59,754
Alcatraz, this is sing sing.

866
01:15:59,756 --> 01:16:01,222
Bmx.

867
01:16:01,224 --> 01:16:02,857
We've struck oil.

868
01:16:02,859 --> 01:16:05,226
I repeat, bmx.
We've struck oil.

869
01:16:05,228 --> 01:16:07,228
Hold it! Hold it!

870
01:16:10,233 --> 01:16:11,832
They're there!

871
01:16:11,834 --> 01:16:13,801
The p.O.W.S. They're there!

872
01:16:13,803 --> 01:16:15,236
Jesus Christ.

873
01:16:15,238 --> 01:16:16,837
They're there!

874
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:29,116
Let's find those choppers.

875
01:16:31,988 --> 01:16:33,988
It could've been Frank.

876
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:35,923
I just don't know.

877
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:38,259
We will know soon enough.

878
01:16:42,765 --> 01:16:45,733
Well, I've got some
nocturnal planting to do.

879
01:16:45,735 --> 01:16:48,235
Scott, good luck... Jiang.

880
01:16:48,237 --> 01:16:50,137
Wilkesy, let's go.

881
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:03,784
Colonel, we've
got to move faster.

882
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:07,154
There's a lot of
jungle to cover...

883
01:17:07,156 --> 01:17:09,657
Between that base and us.

884
01:17:09,659 --> 01:17:11,726
Come on.

885
01:17:35,318 --> 01:17:36,951
Where is it?

886
01:17:36,953 --> 01:17:40,955
I know it came
down in this area.

887
01:17:40,957 --> 01:17:42,957
Hurry. It's almost dawn.

888
01:19:09,312 --> 01:19:11,312
All right. They're asleep.

889
01:19:11,314 --> 01:19:14,915
Let's get them
before they wake up.

890
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,955
Charts and sailor,
take the barracks.

891
01:19:20,957 --> 01:19:23,324
I'll take the
officers' quarters.

892
01:19:23,326 --> 01:19:26,327
Mr. Charts must
fly the helicopter.

893
01:19:26,329 --> 01:19:28,329
He cannot risk injury.

894
01:19:28,331 --> 01:19:32,333
I will go in first
with Mr. Sailor.

895
01:19:33,336 --> 01:19:34,802
Charts?

896
01:19:50,086 --> 01:19:53,087
They should be on their way.

897
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:40,467
Get out of here! Let's go!

898
01:20:43,272 --> 01:20:44,872
Hands up!

899
01:20:49,278 --> 01:20:51,278
Charts... Charts!

900
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:52,913
Get the gunship!

901
01:20:52,915 --> 01:20:54,281
Johnson, in the huey!

902
01:20:54,283 --> 01:20:56,884
Hold them right here, sailor!

903
01:20:56,886 --> 01:20:59,920
Lai fun, stay with sailor!

904
01:21:14,303 --> 01:21:16,203
Battery!

905
01:21:42,331 --> 01:21:44,031
Up on the Ridge!

906
01:21:44,033 --> 01:21:45,332
I'll cover!

907
01:21:50,106 --> 01:21:52,239
Johnson's chopper
took another hit!

908
01:21:54,610 --> 01:21:56,277
Spot for me.

909
01:22:00,049 --> 01:22:01,982
I got a guy.

910
01:22:01,984 --> 01:22:04,985
200 meters, top of the Ridge,

911
01:22:04,987 --> 01:22:06,954
left of the tree.

912
01:22:08,190 --> 01:22:09,623
Right, two meters!

913
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:12,359
Got him!

914
01:22:13,629 --> 01:22:15,262
All right!

915
01:22:17,366 --> 01:22:19,099
Baby!

916
01:22:19,101 --> 01:22:21,235
Let's go! Let's go!

917
01:22:30,379 --> 01:22:32,379
Let's go! Let's go!

918
01:22:35,952 --> 01:22:37,384
Come on, sailor!

919
01:22:46,562 --> 01:22:48,662
Charts! Lai fun!

920
01:23:25,401 --> 01:23:27,301
O.K., fucker!

921
01:23:35,411 --> 01:23:37,344
You're history, pal.

922
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:53,327
Charts, are you with me?

923
01:23:53,329 --> 01:23:55,162
Right behind you.

924
01:23:55,164 --> 01:23:56,697
Johnson, are you with me?

925
01:23:56,699 --> 01:23:58,665
Right on you, colonel!

926
01:24:50,419 --> 01:24:53,187
Shit. Where are they?

927
01:25:04,433 --> 01:25:07,201
You cannot let them
cross the bridge!

928
01:25:07,203 --> 01:25:09,136
What if they don't show?

929
01:25:09,138 --> 01:25:10,604
They are coming.

930
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:12,306
Don't let them
reach the bridge!

931
01:25:12,308 --> 01:25:15,175
Fire in front of them.

932
01:25:15,177 --> 01:25:16,443
Fire!

933
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:26,386
You ain't crossing
that fucking bridge.

934
01:26:05,327 --> 01:26:06,627
It's still there!

935
01:26:06,629 --> 01:26:08,795
Goddamn caps!

936
01:26:30,452 --> 01:26:32,686
Aah!

937
01:26:49,805 --> 01:26:51,205
Hiyah!

938
01:26:51,207 --> 01:26:52,339
Hah!

939
01:27:04,653 --> 01:27:06,286
Come on, bastards!

940
01:27:06,288 --> 01:27:07,888
Come and get it!

941
01:27:10,259 --> 01:27:11,291
One!

942
01:27:13,829 --> 01:27:15,696
Two!

943
01:27:15,698 --> 01:27:19,433
Three! Four! Five!

944
01:27:19,435 --> 01:27:21,368
Six! A new record!

945
01:27:21,370 --> 01:27:22,736
Seven!

946
01:27:22,738 --> 01:27:25,439
Yeah! Eight! Unbelievable!

947
01:27:32,014 --> 01:27:34,715
We can get them out!

948
01:27:45,995 --> 01:27:47,928
Oh, my God!

949
01:28:17,993 --> 01:28:20,327
Yaah!

950
01:29:00,936 --> 01:29:03,103
Whoo! Damn it!

951
01:29:19,388 --> 01:29:21,722
Coming in on the tower.

952
01:29:26,695 --> 01:29:28,462
Son of a bitch!

953
01:29:36,372 --> 01:29:37,704
We've been hit!

954
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:39,106
Hold on!

955
01:29:44,747 --> 01:29:46,680
Gun's jammed, colonel!

956
01:29:49,685 --> 01:29:52,119
I'll take out the tower.

957
01:29:52,121 --> 01:29:53,820
O.K., boss!

958
01:30:05,401 --> 01:30:07,033
We're going to hit heavy!

959
01:30:19,948 --> 01:30:21,415
Colonel!

960
01:30:21,417 --> 01:30:23,183
Wilkes, give me a hand.

961
01:30:23,185 --> 01:30:24,985
Jesus Christ!

962
01:30:24,987 --> 01:30:26,820
Are you all right?

963
01:30:26,822 --> 01:30:27,888
Yeah.

964
01:30:30,726 --> 01:30:32,659
We saw four Americans,

965
01:30:32,661 --> 01:30:34,761
one in your building!

966
01:30:34,763 --> 01:30:36,496
Go! Go! Go!

967
01:30:53,749 --> 01:30:55,115
Frank!

968
01:31:07,229 --> 01:31:08,728
Come on, buddy.

969
01:31:08,730 --> 01:31:10,697
We're going home.

970
01:31:10,699 --> 01:31:12,165
I can't.

971
01:31:12,167 --> 01:31:14,468
The garden.

972
01:31:14,470 --> 01:31:17,137
We'll take it with us.

973
01:31:17,139 --> 01:31:19,072
It's all right.

974
01:31:19,074 --> 01:31:21,708
Come on. It's o.K.

975
01:31:21,710 --> 01:31:24,478
Let's go. Hurry, boss.

976
01:31:36,158 --> 01:31:38,124
Frank? Frank?

977
01:31:50,873 --> 01:31:52,272
It's o.K., soldier.

978
01:31:52,274 --> 01:31:53,773
It's all right.

979
01:31:53,775 --> 01:31:55,108
It's o.K.

980
01:31:59,047 --> 01:32:00,180
No!

981
01:32:00,182 --> 01:32:02,115
Come on, let's go.

982
01:32:02,117 --> 01:32:04,117
Home? Home for real?

983
01:32:04,119 --> 01:32:05,986
Yeah! Come on!

984
01:32:05,988 --> 01:32:08,522
Any more rounds
for the recoilless?

985
01:32:08,524 --> 01:32:09,990
Jiang?

986
01:32:26,842 --> 01:32:28,308
Holy shit!

987
01:32:34,883 --> 01:32:37,551
Eeeyaahhh!

988
01:32:57,072 --> 01:33:00,140
I'll kill you,
you motherfuckers!

989
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:03,743
Charts! This way!

990
01:33:03,745 --> 01:33:05,879
Move it! Move it!

991
01:33:05,881 --> 01:33:07,814
Come on, man!

992
01:33:07,816 --> 01:33:10,116
Go, go, go!

993
01:33:20,963 --> 01:33:24,364
There's no sign of number four.

994
01:33:24,366 --> 01:33:26,299
Where's the other American?

995
01:33:28,003 --> 01:33:29,936
What's he saying?

996
01:33:29,938 --> 01:33:31,371
In the pit.

997
01:33:31,373 --> 01:33:32,939
Where's the pit?

998
01:33:34,977 --> 01:33:40,113
Give me a count of 60, then go.

999
01:33:40,115 --> 01:33:43,350
We can't leave anybody
behind this time.

1000
01:33:43,352 --> 01:33:46,987
Leave, or everybody
will get left behind!

1001
01:34:08,110 --> 01:34:09,342
Frank!

1002
01:34:21,790 --> 01:34:23,757
Macgregor?

1003
01:34:38,874 --> 01:34:41,141
Wilkes, cover me.

1004
01:35:00,796 --> 01:35:03,363
Run, colonel, run!

1005
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:07,200
Run.

1006
01:35:10,038 --> 01:35:11,805
Head for the chopper!

1007
01:35:11,807 --> 01:35:13,373
We'll be wiped out!

1008
01:35:28,190 --> 01:35:30,990
Come on!

1009
01:35:57,352 --> 01:35:59,853
God damn it!

1010
01:36:02,991 --> 01:36:04,023
Wilkes!

1011
01:36:05,327 --> 01:36:06,893
Leave it!

1012
01:36:09,397 --> 01:36:11,364
Come on! Come on!

1013
01:36:14,002 --> 01:36:15,401
Where's sailor?

1014
01:36:15,403 --> 01:36:17,070
He's bought it!

1015
01:36:17,072 --> 01:36:18,404
He's dead!

1016
01:36:29,017 --> 01:36:32,018
Sailor! Sailor!

1017
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:35,155
Eeeyaaah!

1018
01:36:44,566 --> 01:36:46,566
Come on, man.

1019
01:36:46,568 --> 01:36:48,168
Come on.

1020
01:36:49,571 --> 01:36:51,571
Where's blaster?

1021
01:36:51,573 --> 01:36:53,807
God damn it!

1022
01:36:57,078 --> 01:36:58,378
Mr. Charts!

1023
01:36:58,380 --> 01:36:59,946
Mr. Scott! Come!

1024
01:36:59,948 --> 01:37:01,181
Come quickly!

1025
01:37:01,183 --> 01:37:02,382
This way!

1026
01:37:02,384 --> 01:37:03,583
Charts, come on!

1027
01:37:03,585 --> 01:37:05,218
We got to hustle!

1028
01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:06,386
Come on!

1029
01:37:41,223 --> 01:37:44,624
Mayday! Mayday!
American m.I.A.S on board!

1030
01:37:45,927 --> 01:37:47,293
Mayday! Mayday!

1031
01:37:47,295 --> 01:37:49,362
Chartsy, give me
a hand up here.

1032
01:37:49,364 --> 01:37:51,364
I got a heavy stick.

1033
01:37:53,969 --> 01:37:55,335
Mayday! Mayday!

1034
01:37:55,337 --> 01:37:58,137
American m.I.A.S on board!

1035
01:38:26,001 --> 01:38:28,401
It's really good...

1036
01:38:28,403 --> 01:38:30,670
To see you.

1037
01:38:36,077 --> 01:38:37,410
Frank...

1038
01:38:40,382 --> 01:38:42,382
He got sick...

1039
01:38:43,385 --> 01:38:46,386
So sick.

1040
01:38:46,388 --> 01:38:49,088
I tried to help him.

1041
01:38:51,126 --> 01:38:53,393
He died.

1042
01:39:03,204 --> 01:39:06,306
He saved my life that day.

1043
01:39:10,645 --> 01:39:12,679
He saved my life.

1044
01:40:16,011 --> 01:40:20,246
¶ We're all startin' to feel ¶

1045
01:40:20,248 --> 01:40:23,116
¶ the pain we endure ¶

1046
