1
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:46,058
Third refill
costs a nickel.

2
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:51,022
Tip.

3
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:34,649
Let's go! On the pass.

4
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,693
Gotcha. Fifteen.
Let's go. Come on!

5
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,071
And raise 10,000.

6
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:45,409
Twenty-five! Five! Ten!

7
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:47,870
Come on. Come on.
Fifteen.

8
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,331
Hey, you guys
have limits.

9
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,085
High five.

10
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,424
And raise 10,000.

11
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:04,345
Anybody up?
Twenty-five. Gotcha!

12
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,806
One-seven-five,
one-seven-five left.

13
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,850
Nobody wants to bet
against my hitter here, huh?

14
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:15,147
Nobody wants to bet?
Might as well sell tickets
to the place here.

15
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,442
Three on my side!
I got three. Right.

16
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,653
Ten. I got ten.
Oh, biggies.

17
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,072
- Anybody?
- Fifteen!

18
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:26,617
I got 30.
Oh, ho.
Real spenders we got here.

19
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:29,036
Real high rollers.

20
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,122
Ah, you had
your chance.

21
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,708
Come on. Let's go.

22
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,544
We're ready over here.

23
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:39,755
Just remember, anything goes but
no hittin' when somebody's down.

24
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,925
- Yeah.
- Okay. Let 'em go.

25
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:46,053
You want it? You want it?
Yeah? Go get it.
I want it.

26
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,818
Get in there!
Get in there!
Hey! Okay, Chuck!

27
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,088
Son of a bitch.

28
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,720
All right.
Come on, Chuck boy. Get him.

29
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,765
Get in there!

30
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,518
Get in there. Get him.

31
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:37,855
Get in there!

32
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,357
Ohhh!

33
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,193
Go get him!

34
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:43,736
Come on! Go get him!

35
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:49,116
You can get him, Chuck!
Come on! Take him now!

36
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,872
Move in on him.
Move in!

37
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,047
Yes! Yes!

38
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:32,701
Come on. Get up.
Come on. Come on. Get up.

39
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:35,955
Come on. Come on
Get up!
Come on. Get up!

40
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:42,962
Get up, you chump!

41
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,639
Hey, listen.
I think I can do
about six more of those.

42
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,019
Yeah. And a couple
of lemons there.

43
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,547
You can start
anytime, pal.

44
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,716
Chaney.

45
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,053
So what?

46
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,389
We could
make some money.

47
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:38,976
Right. Well,
I'm all ears, friend.

48
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,770
That piece of business
tonight. You set it up?

49
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:44,398
Happens all the time.
Help yourself.
Thanks.

50
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:49,403
- Suppose you been down
the long, hard road.
- Who hasn't?

51
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,324
Jail?
You a policeman?

52
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:57,036
Just like to know
where men come from,
that's all.

53
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,878
You look a little past it.
Besides, I already got a hitter.

54
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:10,174
Yeah. Yeah. I saw him.
Aw, son of a bitch
laid down on me tonight.

55
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,427
Look, friend.
Every town's got a bar,

56
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:16,555
and the bar's got
somebody who thinks
he's tough as a nickel steak.

57
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,558
But they all come
to Speed for the do-re-mi.

58
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:22,019
He's a bum,
I'm the one that loses.

59
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,149
I don't want your dough.

60
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:32,738
I got six bucks...
and nothin' else.

61
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,783
You bet it.

62
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,207
Well, well, well,
my old friend Speed's back...

63
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,834
with another
potential winner.

64
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,462
Anybody want
to bet this man?
Not after last night.

65
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,547
Anybody?

66
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,467
I'll give two to one.

67
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,637
Three to one!

68
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:01,809
Come on! Odds like that
do not come around every day.

69
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:07,106
Guess you boys aren't
as slow as he is.

70
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:13,195
Gives us 150 in the pot.
Gonna hold it?

71
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,824
And I got another 1-5-0
for anybody expects a repeat.
What do I hear?

72
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,867
Fifty.
Twenty.
Forty.

73
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,911
Got it.
I'll take it all.
Anybody else?

74
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,873
You're crazy!
You got 15 more.
You a bettin' man?

75
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,334
Oh, wait a minute.

76
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:30,796
We got another six.
That's all we got.

77
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,756
I'll take all of it.

78
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,758
I did my part, pal.
He's all yours.

79
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:37,052
Hey, Pops, you're a little old
for this, ain't ya?

80
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,848
Let's go. Let's go.
Get the fight going. Come on.

81
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:25,100
Like everything else
in this world, it takes
money to make money.

82
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,102
Here's your 12.

83
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:31,440
Another ten just
to have some fun on.

84
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,650
Work out our official
deal later, huh?

85
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:36,362
Plenty more
where that came from.

86
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,447
You don't have
to worry about that.

87
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:43,494
Now. New Orleans...

88
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:46,121
Speed's comin' home.
A little taste?

89
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,043
No?

90
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,659
Hello, sugarplum.

91
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,285
How'd it go, Speedy?

92
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,995
Well, a rough start
but a fast finish.

93
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,539
Uh-huh. How much?

94
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,457
Even.
Oh, wonderful.

95
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:33,085
Always be pleasant
around strangers, honey.

96
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:37,047
This is Chaney.
Gayleen Schoonover,
my permanent fiancée.

97
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:39,174
I'm pleased to meet you,
Mr. Chaney.

98
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,845
There she is. Let's go.
I'll just say
good-bye right here.

99
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,055
Wait a minute, pal.
We got some plans to make.

100
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,142
I wanna feel my way around the city.

101
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:52,146
- What about our partnership?
- I don't like to rush things.

102
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,189
Jesus Christ!
What are you talking about?

103
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,234
Always be pleasant
around strangers, Speed.

104
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,570
Are we gonna see
you again, Mr. Chaney?

105
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,990
I might turn up.

106
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,786
Don't forget now.
Number 11 Dauphine Street.

107
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:10,539
Who was that guy?

108
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,668
I'll tell you who he was.
Money on the hoof.

109
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,645
It looks a little rougher
than it really is,

110
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,773
but you get a lot of sun
through that window.

111
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:39,193
Fix the place up,
could be real nice.

112
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:43,572
Got some furniture
down in the storage room
you could use.

113
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,950
- Nah, I like it the way it is.
- Buck and a half a week.

114
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:51,997
In advance.

115
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,326
Mind if I sit down?

116
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:22,921
Would you like to talk or just sit?

117
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,468
What's your name?

118
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,891
Who you waitin' for?

119
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:39,730
I'm waitin' for
somebody to buy me
another cup of coffee.

120
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,773
Have mine.

121
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,282
You live around here?

122
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,411
Didn't take ya long
to get around to that one.

123
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,622
Thought maybe
I could walk you home.

124
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,750
Not likely.

125
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:07,924
Girl had two choices
in my hometown.

126
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:12,220
Stay and be bored
or move out
and take chances.

127
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:15,140
How's your luck
been runnin'?
How can you ask that?

128
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,184
Look how good I'm livin'.

129
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,227
Well, I've seen worse.

130
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,855
That depends on what
you're looking for.

131
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,859
How 'bout you?
I don't look past
the next bend in the road.

132
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,195
Want me
to come in?
No.

133
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:32,407
- You sure?
- It's not that easy.

134
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:36,787
I got a husband in jail.
No job and no prospects.

135
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:41,541
- I wasn't plannin' on botherin' ya.
- Oh? What was your plan?

136
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:46,296
Maybe I'll see ya around.

137
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,121
Jesus Christ!

138
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,376
Come on. Get up.

139
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,420
Babe!

140
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,428
H-Hey, good to see you, pal.

141
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:37,013
I'm mighty glad
you found time to stop by.

142
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:43,562
Come on!
Get things started right.
Don't mind Sleepin' Beauty here.

143
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,857
She's not one to rush
into the day's work,
are ya? Goddamn it.

144
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:50,986
We got an important guest here.
How 'bout gettin' up and
fixin' breakfast for us?

145
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,656
- Mornin'.
- Christ on a crutch.

146
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:58,368
Hey, so I suppose you want
to talk deal, huh?

147
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:03,999
Well, we go 50-50 on all
scratch bets and expenses.

148
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,294
All side bets,
I keep 75 percent.
That's how it works.

149
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:11,631
Sixty-forty in my favor
on scratch, side bets
down the middle.

150
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:16,636
I'm tellin' ya the goin' rate.
What's normal. Ask anybody.

151
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:19,931
- We'll do things different.
- Why should we?

152
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,811
Because right now, my friend,
you got a percentage of nothin'.

153
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:29,775
That makes me even with you.
I'm puttin' up all the money.
I take all the risks.

154
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:39,576
All right. All right. All right.
We'll do it your way.

155
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:45,165
Gayleen! What's a man have to do
to get some breakfast around here?

156
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:53,340
I got a good feelin' 'bout this.
I think we'll make some real money.

157
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:58,470
I've got a couple things in mind.
Set something up for you next week.

158
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,932
Go in slow, quiet. Four
or five hundred dollars.
Something like that.

159
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:04,893
There's something I want you
to know. I only come down here
to make some money.

160
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:08,021
Well?
And to fill in
some in-betweens.

161
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,816
In-betweens? Hell,
that's no kind of livin'.
Well, it suits me.

162
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,110
When I get enough change
in my pocket, I'm gone.

163
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:46,476
We just mark
this one down to research.
Part of your education.

164
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:50,730
I wanna have a long
talk with anybody
bettin' against me.

165
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:53,483
Listen. A hundred dollars
against Curly.

166
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:58,989
- On a marker.
- Uh-uh. No markers.

167
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,826
- Chick, boy, wha...
- Take it.

168
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:09,332
Who else?

169
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:12,127
Who's the smoothy
over there?

170
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:18,341
That's Chick Gandil.
One of the big money belts in town.

171
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:22,012
Son of a bitch has
broken me out three times.

172
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:26,349
He's the one we're gonna shake.

173
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,694
Anybody?
Last call!

174
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,363
Stay away from him.
Move fast. Jab him.

175
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,255
Ohhh!

176
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:51,101
Somebody help
this kid up.

177
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:23,717
That's why
he's the best.

178
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:27,470
Nobody ever beats him.
Not many want to try.

179
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,913
What the hell
you doin' back there?

180
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:20,792
I've always been a student
of comparative religion.

181
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:24,337
The Pentecostals present
a number of points of interest.

182
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,965
How much dopin'
are you doin'?

183
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:31,761
This month my financial
condition has prevented...

184
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:34,973
certain journeys
of the imagination.

185
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:38,726
Good. We're back
in business.

186
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,271
I really got somebody
for us this time.

187
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:44,607
Chaney, I want you
to meet my old friend, Poe.

188
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:51,030
Fix up your cuts,
bruises... all sorts
of good things.

189
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:55,201
I have two years
of medical school
to recommend me.

190
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:57,120
Two years doesn't
make a doctor.

191
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:02,750
Well, in my third year of studies,
a small, black cloud
appeared on campus.

192
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:05,461
I left under it.
What he's tryin'
to say is that...

193
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:07,755
he's a dyed-in-the-wool
hophead.

194
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,716
I have a weakness
for opium.

195
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,135
That's a habit
that's hard to quit.

196
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:16,472
Some are born to fail.
Others have it thrust upon them.

197
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:18,975
Could I see your hands?

198
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:25,148
Oh. No protruding
knuckles.

199
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,944
No calcium deposits.
Mm-hmm.

200
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:33,239
Make a fist. Ooh.

201
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:37,911
More area to absorb
the concussion of a blow
without breaking.

202
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:40,371
Simple matter
of engineering stress.

203
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:43,875
Reasonably thick skin.
Oh, he's got good skin.

204
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:47,503
I'd say there's
a good chance you're not...

205
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:51,132
what Speed, with an
unfortunate turn of phrase,
refers to as "a bleeder."

206
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:54,510
Like I told you, he's good.
How much?

207
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:58,223
Ten percent of what we
win, expenses. Standard.

208
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:18,451
Uh, hi.
Mr. Le Beau here?

209
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:41,766
I need a, uh, short-termer
for a thousand.

210
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,851
Huh. That's
a heavy taste.

211
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:46,312
How short?
Oh, a day, maybe two.

212
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:48,523
I've done business
with you before.

213
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:52,735
Yeah.
'Bout a year ago.
Mm-hmm.

214
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:58,616
- Got your money back.
- Yeah. You paid back
my $300 all right.

215
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:01,119
But you had to borrow it
from Abboar to do it.

216
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:04,122
That one you didn't
cover so well.

217
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:07,583
- Three weeks over. Big deal.
- It was closer to three months.

218
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:10,086
Well, he got paid.
What's the difference?

219
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:15,425
Well, there's a big difference
between me and Abboar.

220
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,679
Well, I'll, uh,
take your word for that.

221
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,059
Okay, Speed.

222
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:30,273
- That's 950.
- I said a thousand.

223
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:33,443
That's 50 for the loan.

224
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:35,820
And 50 for every day
until it comes back.

225
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:41,492
Whew. Boy, you really
puttin' the Jesse James to me.

226
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,973
Now, you wait
here, huh?

227
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:13,649
Well, how long
you gonna be?

228
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:15,651
'Cause I don't feel like
sittin' out here all day.

229
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:18,112
Listen. Don't start
complaining now.

230
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,656
Don't you get caught up
in any kind of game
in there, Speed.

231
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:23,534
Business.
It's business.

232
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,081
Give me one.

233
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:33,044
Well, hello, Speed.
Good seein' you, Chick.

234
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,129
How's my personal pigeon?

235
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,131
Just stopped by
to pay off my marker.

236
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:41,511
Well, that's all right now.
We all make mistakes.

237
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:44,472
- Guess you heard about my new hitter?
-  I'll see that.

238
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:47,016
Uh, yeah.
Word gets around.
Oh, he's good.

239
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:50,520
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Might even work him up
to ape man over there.

240
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:53,189
Well, now, there's...
there's no mystery about it.

241
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:56,192
It's my standard deal.
But, uh, you see,

242
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,194
you do have to have
a thousand dollars up front.

243
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,863
You makin' an offer?

244
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:03,157
Well, my man's just startin' out.

245
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,743
He's good,
but I have to get long odds
if I'm gonna face skinhead.

246
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:11,082
Assuming that you did have
the money, what kind of odds
you talkin' about?

247
00:29:12,126 --> 00:29:15,711
- Five to one.
- Three to one.

248
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:22,385
Deal!
Somebody die
and leave it to ya?

249
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,554
Three to one, Chickie.
Money's on the table.
What do ya say?

250
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:26,931
You know,
I don't like being hustled
by a hope-and-a-prayer artist.

251
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,142
You're not gettin'
in that cheap.

252
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:32,103
The pot bet just now
went up to three thousand.

253
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:35,815
Now, you come on back,
when you get that rich.

254
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:40,403
- You mean to tell me
we don't have a deal?
- Not for a thousand.

255
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:47,535
I'll see you soon, Dempsey.

256
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:00,923
I'm feelin' quite fine,
Mr. Pettibon. Quite fine.

257
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:04,802
Well, listen, we got a boy
down here I think could make
an interesting contest for you.

258
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:10,349
Well, now, that's, uh,
quite a bit of money.

259
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:15,521
I don't know whether
our boy's up to it or not.
He's just startin' out.

260
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:17,648
He's, uh, real game.
He's awful green though.

261
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:21,777
Nobody takes advantage
of you bayou people.

262
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:27,366
We'll be there, Mr. Pettibon.
Good talkin' with ya.

263
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,787
Told you it'd be a fat one.

264
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:33,873
Barber...
How high?

265
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,586
Two thousand George Washingtons.
Is that "high" enough for ya?

266
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:41,130
Gonna pay some bills.
The dun at the door,

267
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:43,508
the wolf at the gate
shall be held in abeyance.

268
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:46,469
Mm-hmm.
You're that sure
of Mr. Chaney.

269
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,722
Su...
Does a goose
go barefoot?

270
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:53,309
I'm goin' to get
some cigars.

271
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:58,916
Oh, Mr. Pettibon.

272
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:01,711
Good to see you
again, Mr. Weed.

273
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:03,838
Ah, look what we did
for your little visit.

274
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:06,549
Well, this is mighty fine,
mighty fine.
I knew you'd like it.

275
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:10,511
Ah, this is my fiancée,
Miss Gayleen Schoonover.

276
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,888
Well, how do, ma'am?
Pleasure, Mr. Pettibon.

277
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:15,016
And, you remember
Mr. Poe here.

278
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,853
O-Oh, sure, Mr. Poe.
Nice to see you again, sir.

279
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,022
And that's Chaney.

280
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:25,526
- He don't say much.
- They's got a plan.

281
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:28,487
He ain't gonna say
much at all later.

282
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:33,576
That's your plan,
Mr. Pettibon, not ours.

283
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,078
Oh, now, now,
you said he was green.

284
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:39,081
What?
Third time out.

285
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:44,378
Well, he don't
look unpicked to me.

286
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:50,426
I guess I'll let my man
be the judge of that.
That's him right over there.

287
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:57,183
He looks like he's
up to the mark.

288
00:32:57,267 --> 00:33:00,853
He'd better be.

289
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,186
Goddamn!

290
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:30,067
Aw, hell!

291
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:34,989
Very pretty. Very nice.
You better get
the money.

292
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,950
Oh, listen.
Nobody ever has
to tell me to do that.

293
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:45,207
Well, that's how
it's done, Mr. Pettibon.

294
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,793
I guess it just wasn't
your day, was it?

295
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,338
Damn small question
about that.

296
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:57,428
What the hell you doin'?

297
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:02,767
Well, now, this has been
a big setback for us.

298
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:06,562
I didn't think anybody could
go through my man that way.

299
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:09,315
It's obviously
an error in judgment on
your part then, wasn't it?

300
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:12,276
It was too damned easy.

301
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:17,072
There ain't no rules
about that, except who wins.
Now, that money's ours.

302
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:19,241
Somethin' wrong,
Speed?

303
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:23,537
Yeah. We got us a problem.
You're a ringer, Mr. Chaney.

304
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,456
You give us our goddamn money!

305
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:30,085
You want that money?
Take it.

306
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:33,547
Somebody always
shows up with a gun.

307
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:36,300
Goddamn sack
of country shit.

308
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,762
Steady on, Speed.
These boys are not refined.

309
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:45,267
I think you folks
better get in your car
and just drive right on home.

310
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:49,063
I think that's
pretty good advice.
There's a man makes some sense.

311
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,899
- He ain't gonna pay.
- Just okay?

312
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:55,986
Listen, goddamn it!
Next time I come back
to this coon-ass place,

313
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,197
I'm gonna bring a gun.
Well, you do that.

314
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,407
Make sure it's
a great big one.

315
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:02,868
Now, get on out!

316
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:09,458
That's how it's done.

317
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:28,853
Sorry spectacle.

318
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:33,023
Very poor example
of Southern sportsmanship.

319
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:39,697
All this drivin' for nothin'.
My God, it breaks your heart.

320
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:42,074
Breaks my butt,
that's what it breaks.

321
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,372
Why don't we take it
easy and drive around
the backcountry roads...

322
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:51,625
and see the sights
for a while?

323
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,919
What the hell
are you talkin' about?

324
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,172
Business.

325
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:24,950
Well, anyway, he went
through L.J. Just like that.
Nothin' to it.

326
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,251
Anybody see that?

327
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,711
- My goodness!
- Jesus Christ.

328
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:45,054
- Now I got the gun.
- I guess you do.

329
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:00,819
Anybody else?

330
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:03,906
What about you?

331
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:21,465
I don't think
you want to use it.

332
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,308
That's one way.
You want to see another?

333
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:47,491
Gayleen!

334
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:50,953
This your place,
Pettibon?

335
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:13,475
He's tearing the place up.

336
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:16,812
Whee.

337
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:29,241
Ooh.

338
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:41,170
Come on back here!
Where y'all goin'?
Come here! Come here!

339
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:14,286
Is this
where you live?

340
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,539
I'll see ya
in a couple of days.

341
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:22,586
- You know who we're
goin' after next?
- Yeah.

342
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:26,381
If this isn't your place,
who's the lucky lady?
Hey.

343
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:29,635
Y'all have a real
big time now, you hear?

344
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:59,331
Who is it?
Chaney.

345
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,003
What do you want?

346
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:08,257
Thought maybe you'd
like to come out.

347
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:11,343
You'd treat me
to a champagne
breakfast or somethin'?

348
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:15,514
Whatever you feel like.

349
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:20,102
You know, it's 5:00 a.m.

350
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,146
Christ, I barely know you.

351
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:26,191
Yeah, but would you like to?

352
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:31,321
I guess I can make
you some coffee.

353
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:49,590
You haven't gotten around
to tellin' me what you do.

354
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:53,886
Well, it's somethin'
people generally ask.

355
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,307
You worried I can't
pay the check?
No.

356
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:00,976
I'm worried because you never
answer any questions.

357
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:04,313
Now, tell me.
How do you make money?

358
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,026
I knock people down.

359
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:15,324
You mean
like a prizefighter?

360
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:20,454
No. They're pickup fights.
The money's made on bets.

361
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,582
And it's something
I'm doin' just for a while.

362
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:27,336
Funny way to make a livin'.

363
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:33,425
It's better than workin'
at the bus station changin' tires
for two bucks a day.

364
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:38,764
What does it feel like
to knock somebody down?

365
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:44,269
It makes me feel
a hell of a lot better
than it does him.

366
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:47,689
That's a reason?

367
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:55,280
Hey, there's no reasons
about it. Just money.

368
00:43:20,974 --> 00:43:22,891
Hello, Chick!

369
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,686
Good to see you.
How's tricks?
This is a private gatherin'.

370
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:29,273
I don't believe
you gentlemen were invited.
No. You remember Mr. Poe here.

371
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:32,651
Mr. Poe.
Mr. Gandil.
This is gonna take one minute.

372
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:37,447
Now, you remember those
special numbers you quoted
me on, that three to one?

373
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:39,783
I'm gonna take you up
on that bet.

374
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:44,329
First you got to have
3,000 real whole dollars.

375
00:43:44,414 --> 00:43:47,582
Otherwise, it's just
an academic question.

376
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:56,133
You wanna count it?

377
00:43:58,428 --> 00:44:00,137
Okay. You're on.

378
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:25,120
Howdy, Doty.

379
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:27,205
Speed.

380
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:35,047
You know, we haven't been
seeing you around town.

381
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:37,174
Yeah.
Well, I been busy.

382
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:40,344
You don't have
anything in the eighth.

383
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:44,473
Man who can afford
a shoeshine sure ought
to be able to pay his debts.

384
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:48,435
Well, I got to keep up
appearances, huh?

385
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:57,652
Way we figure it,
you're overdue.

386
00:44:57,737 --> 00:44:59,654
Overdue for what?

387
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:03,575
You pushin' me, Doty?
You'll get your money.

388
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:06,203
Sure we will.

389
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:11,375
I got $200 I'll lay
on you right now.
How's that?

390
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:13,794
Hmm?

391
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,673
Steal it.

392
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:20,258
Sell your sister.

393
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:23,053
Borrow it.

394
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,556
But get it all.
Yeah, well...

395
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:30,268
Now!
Well, I need some time.

396
00:45:30,353 --> 00:45:33,021
Couple of days.

397
00:45:33,106 --> 00:45:35,857
No. Two days.
Couple of days. I got-
I got everythin' workin'.

398
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:38,193
Come on. Two days.

399
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:44,741
Better be a promise.
You can bank on that.

400
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:19,187
Has been a few unfortunate
fighters busted their knuckles
on that hard head of his.

401
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:29,197
Bets in. Time!
All bets in!

402
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:35,537
Hey, old man.
I'm gonna end it for ya.

403
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:38,415
Just keep smilin', Big Jim,
while you still got some lips.

404
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:41,876
When I get done with him,
I'm comin' after you, big shot.

405
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:44,629
The only thing you gonna
be comin' after is a doctor.

406
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:50,093
Jesus, I just saw it over there.
$9,000 in a man's hand.

407
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:53,096
Whew... Enough
to take your breath away.

408
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,265
Start 'em. Get 'em goin'.

409
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:58,393
You okay?
We're ready over here!

410
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,156
Whoo-o-o.

411
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:46,042
Come on, Chaney.
Goddamn it.

412
00:50:53,134 --> 00:50:55,677
Oh.

413
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,178
Yeah!

414
00:51:02,852 --> 00:51:03,935
Go get him!

415
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:08,940
Hey, you're pretty good.

416
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:55,445
Yeah!

417
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,170
That's it!

418
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:42,826
Yes!

419
00:53:03,556 --> 00:53:07,183
Whoo-o-o...
Goddamn!

420
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:25,118
My, my, my, my, my!
Look at that lying there
like a dead man.

421
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,370
Hardly know whether to call
for an ambulance or a hearse.

422
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,998
On second thought, let's
get a wheelbarrow in here...

423
00:53:30,082 --> 00:53:32,917
and haul Mr. Gandil's
hitter out.

424
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:41,843
You've always had an unfortunate
way of puttin' things, Speed.

425
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:44,262
Nothin' personal, Chick.

426
00:53:53,606 --> 00:53:56,774
Look at that.

427
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:05,950
All right. All right.
Stand... Come on.

428
00:54:06,035 --> 00:54:09,621
Let him through.
Let him through.
Goddamn. Come on now.

429
00:54:33,646 --> 00:54:35,563
Hey, Chaney!

430
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:40,401
Hey, listen.
I got a message from our
old friend, Chick Gandil.

431
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:42,570
He wants us to come up
and have a drink with him.

432
00:54:42,655 --> 00:54:45,406
You handle it.
I'm not interested.

433
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:47,492
Oh, now, he said "us."

434
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:50,745
Never hurt anybody
to be polite.

435
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:07,261
Yeah!

436
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:11,683
Oh, I saw you out there.
Smooth, real smooth.

437
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:14,686
Thank you. Thank you.
It's all in the partner
that you have.

438
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:16,688
A-Ah, yes.
Thank you.

439
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:19,941
I would like
to propose a toast.

440
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:27,115
I propose a toast
to the... best man I know.

441
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:30,493
To the Napoleon
of Southern sports.

442
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:34,372
Me.
Speed.
Speed.

443
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:39,127
Come on, Gayleen. Let's get
with those galloping dominoes.

444
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:41,587
We'll see you all later. Have
a good time now. Okay, Poe?

445
00:55:41,714 --> 00:55:45,049
Come on, honey.

446
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:54,434
I assume you realize that the blood
of the fabled Edgar Allan
courses through my veins.

447
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:58,980
No. But it sure sounds like
I'm gonna hear about it.
Yes.

448
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:04,819
"Hear the sledges
with the bells.

449
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,821
"Silver bells.

450
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:11,576
"How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle
in the icy air of night.

451
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:14,620
"While the stars,
that over-sprinkle...

452
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:17,081
"All the heavens,
seem to twinkle...

453
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:19,208
with a crystalline delight."

454
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:29,093
Hey, come on here.
All right.

455
00:56:29,178 --> 00:56:31,220
Get the whole 400 for the line.

456
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:33,347
Get 'em over here.

457
00:56:33,432 --> 00:56:36,392
Don't give me a short count now, okay?

458
00:56:36,477 --> 00:56:38,895
- Come on, dice!
- Snake eyes!

459
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:40,521
Son of a bitch!

460
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:45,610
All right, pass the dice.
He's through.
Not yet, pal.

461
00:56:45,694 --> 00:56:48,780
Shoot it all. Okay.

462
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:51,783
Bet it all.

463
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:54,035
Come on, nine!

464
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:56,370
Point six.

465
00:56:56,455 --> 00:57:00,041
Everything in there? Come on!

466
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:01,876
All right!

467
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,045
Six is the point.

468
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,380
Come on. Make that six.

469
00:57:06,465 --> 00:57:08,966
All right. I'm lookin'
for a big pair of threes. Come on!

470
00:57:10,803 --> 00:57:14,722
Lose. Next lucky roller.

471
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,685
Get your goddamn
hat and coat.
You lost all of it.

472
00:57:19,812 --> 00:57:24,565
Shut up.
What? Excuse me,
Mr. High Roller.

473
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:26,651
I should have known.

474
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:31,614
Sure has been a lot of fun, pal.

475
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:44,418
How long an arm has he got?

476
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:46,462
Gandil's a businessman.

477
00:57:46,547 --> 00:57:51,300
Worried about his reputation.
He's not gonna try any muscle play.

478
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:56,931
There is one thing we are gonna have
to live with though.

479
00:57:57,015 --> 00:58:00,476
Since you beat old Jim Henry like that,

480
00:58:00,561 --> 00:58:03,187
fights are gonna be harder to find,

481
00:58:03,272 --> 00:58:07,358
and we are gonna have to give odds,
which can be very expensive.

482
00:58:58,118 --> 00:59:03,497
Would you tell Gandil that Mr. Chaney and
Mr. Weed are here to see him, please?

483
00:59:03,624 --> 00:59:08,044
Just go right on in.
Thank you, ma'am.

484
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:12,465
How's your jaw, glass man, hmm?

485
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:18,846
Well, I'm glad you could drop by, Speed.

486
00:59:18,931 --> 00:59:23,434
Always a pleasure. You
remember Mr. Chaney here.

487
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:30,024
Well, sit down.
Get comfortable.
Thank you.

488
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:32,693
You, uh, care
for a drink?
No, no, no.

489
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:34,695
Too early for me. Thank you.

490
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:39,742
All business, huh?
That's right.
Well, let's have it.

491
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:42,411
You got a direct way of speakin'.

492
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:44,413
Don't let it upset ya, Chick.

493
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:46,707
I like a man that's direct.

494
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:51,212
Makes everything easy to understand,
like the old days.

495
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:55,216
Chick, we didn't come down here
for no history lesson.

496
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,301
Let's get down to cases.

497
00:59:57,386 --> 01:00:00,805
Maybe we should at that.

498
01:00:00,889 --> 01:00:04,725
There's $5,000 in that envelope.

499
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,104
It's yours.

500
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,483
I don't believe I'm followin' the drift.

501
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:15,653
I'm buyin' half of Chaney.

502
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:20,408
You talk to me, not him.

503
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:34,505
I used to have the best street fighter
in this city. Now I don't.

504
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,674
I don't like that at all.

505
01:00:44,516 --> 01:00:46,851
We can get along without you.

506
01:00:54,693 --> 01:00:57,111
I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Chaney.

507
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:59,613
I hope you come around to my way of thinkin'.

508
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:21,719
Well, hell! Look who's here.

509
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:26,599
Speed, you come to your Mama Lois's
to have a really good time.

510
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,684
Oh, I sure did, Mama.

511
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:33,356
I got myself
some lovely new girls.
Let's go have a look.

512
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,984
Girls, girls!

513
01:01:37,069 --> 01:01:41,697
Now, Speed, each one has been especially
trained to suit your fancy.

514
01:01:41,782 --> 01:01:45,993
I don't need no sales pitch.
I just come to get my hat blocked.

515
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:58,089
Well, how about
havin' a drink, mister?
Sure. Bourbon.

516
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:09,850
What'd you say
your name was?
Carol.

517
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:14,230
Carol.

518
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:20,528
What'd you think about that, Carol?

519
01:02:23,615 --> 01:02:28,285
Hey, it was terrific. You were really great.

520
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:34,083
You know something?

521
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:39,588
That's just exactly what I thought you'd say.

522
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:03,904
What the hell are you doin'?
Hey, Doty!

523
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:06,282
Come on! Hey! Ow!

524
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:11,537
No! Don't. Don't, please...

525
01:03:11,663 --> 01:03:15,166
Is that okay, Doty?
Talk to him.

526
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:20,421
Mr. Le Beau says he's got
some business with you.

527
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:24,425
He don't want no trouble,
just you pay your debts.

528
01:03:25,677 --> 01:03:27,845
Uh-huh.

529
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:32,016
Okay, mister.

530
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:24,318
Well, good seein'
you gentlemen.
Likewise, Speed.

531
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:27,905
We got a few things to talk about,

532
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:30,074
a couple of problems.

533
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:36,413
Well, I gotta get somethin'
goin' in a hurry now.

534
01:04:36,498 --> 01:04:39,625
Been thinkin' about Gandil.

535
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:43,504
Maybe we should reconsider
that offer he made us.

536
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:45,965
Why the change of mind?

537
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:50,052
I'm flat-ass broke. I need some money fast.

538
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:53,055
I don't like Gandil.

539
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:55,516
That's no reason.

540
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:58,644
That's enough reason for me.

541
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:02,815
Well, that's fine for you,
but it doesn't do much for my case, does it?

542
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:07,820
I mean, if we don't go with Gandil,
it means I have to borrow.

543
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:10,864
My credit's not worth a damn all over town.

544
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:13,867
Can you loan me $2,000? That's what I need.

545
01:05:13,952 --> 01:05:18,956
Speed, you made as much as me,
dollar for dollar.

546
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:23,961
Well, the way I look at it, you owe me.

547
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:28,173
We used my bankroll to begin with,

548
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:30,217
my money, my contacts!

549
01:05:30,302 --> 01:05:34,221
You were a bum when I met you,
and you're nothin' without me.

550
01:05:34,306 --> 01:05:36,557
Yeah, I figure you owe me.

551
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,442
Dumb.

552
01:05:46,526 --> 01:05:49,403
You sayin' no to me?

553
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:53,991
Aw, Speed!
Chaney!

554
01:06:05,045 --> 01:06:09,006
Aw, hell, Speed, now we're both finished.

555
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:12,528
Welcome to New Orleans, Street.

556
01:07:17,409 --> 01:07:19,410
I don't do that.

557
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,885
You ever get scared when you do your work?

558
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:39,680
I don't think about it.

559
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:44,184
The only thing you care about is the money.

560
01:07:44,269 --> 01:07:47,771
Isn't that right? Just so the money's good.

561
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:51,942
You got any more questions?

562
01:07:53,737 --> 01:07:58,449
Try this one. Are you gonna stay the night?

563
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:02,119
Not this time.

564
01:08:13,882 --> 01:08:16,675
All right. Let's get it out.

565
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,636
What's botherin' ya?

566
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:28,145
Hell, yes,
something's wrong, a lot of things.

567
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:31,106
The rent, price of groceries,

568
01:08:31,191 --> 01:08:35,903
clothes I can't buy, a few items like that.

569
01:08:35,987 --> 01:08:38,071
How much do you want?

570
01:08:38,156 --> 01:08:42,409
I want my own.
I don't wanna depend on you.

571
01:08:42,494 --> 01:08:44,912
You're not reliable.

572
01:08:44,996 --> 01:08:48,665
You come when you want.
You go when you want.

573
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:52,628
And you never mention
what comes in the middle.

574
01:08:54,923 --> 01:08:57,508
Suit yourself.

575
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:27,871
Can I buy ya one?

576
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:32,751
How you been?

577
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:40,175
You, uh... You wanna talk
about the sportin' life?

578
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:44,555
I'm out of it.
That's too bad.

579
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:48,976
I had to give up on you.
Went out and bought myself another hitter.

580
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,978
The best.

581
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:57,234
Must make you very happy
now that you got what you wanted.

582
01:09:57,318 --> 01:09:59,736
I'll tell you what I want.

583
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:04,616
You must have quite
a stash saved away by now. How about 5,000?

584
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:09,204
Him against you.
Don't need any more money.

585
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:13,292
There's no point in avoiding
this thing, you know.

586
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:16,795
It's gonna happen.
He's right.

587
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:19,590
You want it
that much?
I'm getting paid.

588
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:25,053
I can always reach over
and start things right now.

589
01:10:25,138 --> 01:10:27,890
Yeah, but you won't.

590
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:29,766
You don't think so?

591
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:36,607
You're not gonna do it for free.

592
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:05,886
Who the hell are you?

593
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:07,888
Hey! Hey!

594
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:16,939
Ouch! Son of a bitch! Help!

595
01:11:20,902 --> 01:11:25,572
Hey.
This is your lucky night.

596
01:11:25,657 --> 01:11:28,116
That depends on how you look at it.

597
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:31,244
Well, I'll tell you how to look at it.

598
01:11:31,329 --> 01:11:35,374
Right about now, I'd be deciding
whether to bust your legs or your back.

599
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:40,128
But, um, somebody just paid
the interest on your debt.

600
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:42,297
Just for one week.

601
01:11:44,175 --> 01:11:47,970
Your man fights Mr. Street here,
and I'll handle your home mortgage.

602
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:52,641
My man? He won't even speak to me, Chick.

603
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:55,227
We're gonna put you on ice for a while...

604
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:58,855
and, uh, see if maybe he'll speak to me.

605
01:12:34,642 --> 01:12:38,186
I don't wanna interrupt anything.

606
01:12:39,397 --> 01:12:44,109
Gandil come to see me.
We have got a problem.

607
01:12:44,235 --> 01:12:47,571
You and me ain't
got no trouble, Poe.
I'm afraid we do.

608
01:12:47,655 --> 01:12:49,781
It's about our old friend Speed.

609
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:52,325
He send you?
Don't even
know I'm here.

610
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:56,413
Me and Speed ain't related anymore.

611
01:12:56,497 --> 01:13:00,709
Things don't work that easy.
He's in a lot of trouble.

612
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:02,002
I ain't interested.

613
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:06,298
Speed owes a ton
to one of our local riffraff.

614
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:08,383
They're puttin' the arm on him.

615
01:13:08,468 --> 01:13:12,345
Gandil's gonna pay the loan off
if you take on his man.

616
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:14,931
No crowd, just business.

617
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:18,060
You want me to bet my $5,000.
That's all the money I got.

618
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:20,520
I don't owe that goddamn Speed nothin'.

619
01:13:20,605 --> 01:13:24,441
That's not the point. It's real simple.

620
01:13:24,525 --> 01:13:29,196
He's in the ringer.
You're the only one that can get him out.

621
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:32,115
Money's hard to come by, Poe.

622
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:38,080
Somebody got a cigarette?

623
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:41,249
I don't use any.

624
01:13:41,334 --> 01:13:44,086
Of course, I'd be happy
to go down and get some.

625
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:46,588
You're not goin' anywhere.

626
01:13:46,714 --> 01:13:50,717
Listen, things don't
work out tomorrow night,
which one of you gets to do the job?

627
01:13:50,802 --> 01:13:53,637
We both do.

628
01:13:53,721 --> 01:13:58,141
Mm-mmm, not this time. I'll take him.

629
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:04,481
That's right. You haven't won one
in a while, have you, Jim?

630
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:11,988
Three cards.
He really cleaned your plow, didn't he?

631
01:14:12,073 --> 01:14:15,117
Why don't you shut up and play cards?

632
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:32,384
- Think he's gonna show up?
- Sure hope not.

633
01:14:42,353 --> 01:14:44,187
I've got a visitor.

634
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:50,026
Some other time.
Uh, no, wait.

635
01:14:50,111 --> 01:14:52,654
I'll walk you down.

636
01:15:14,552 --> 01:15:16,761
Well, how you been?

637
01:15:16,888 --> 01:15:20,932
How do I look?
I got no complaints.

638
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:24,686
There's somethin' I gotta tell you.

639
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:27,856
I don't think you should drop by anymore.

640
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:32,194
Things have changed.

641
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:36,448
I think I'm movin'.

642
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:39,701
I'm gonna get a better place.

643
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:43,538
I got a better offer.

644
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:47,334
Someone that spends the night.

645
01:15:48,753 --> 01:15:51,546
He's even got a steady job.

646
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:58,178
Looks like you got things all figured out.

647
01:15:58,262 --> 01:16:01,264
Is that all you've got to say?

648
01:16:44,642 --> 01:16:46,601
Gentlemen.

649
01:16:46,686 --> 01:16:52,399
Evenin'. Your man gonna show up?

650
01:16:52,483 --> 01:16:55,986
We just have to wait and find out.

651
01:19:33,352 --> 01:19:35,311
Let's get started.

652
01:19:35,396 --> 01:19:38,398
Why not?

653
01:19:39,733 --> 01:19:44,404
Where are they?
Upstairs.
Uh, go up and get 'em...

654
01:19:44,488 --> 01:19:46,698
I'll do it!

655
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:17,187
We're not gonna wait here all night!

656
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:48,843
Thanks, pal.

657
01:20:50,429 --> 01:20:54,307
Just like old times, huh?
We did add
a couple of new wrinkles.

658
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:56,184
Ever see him fight?

659
01:20:57,436 --> 01:20:59,646
No, I can't say
I've had the pleasure.

660
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:02,649
But they didn't bring him
down all the way from Chicago to lose.

661
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:04,651
Let's do it.

662
01:21:04,735 --> 01:21:08,154
All right, you pissant big shots,
we're ready over here.

663
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:10,323
All right, anybody else got anything to say?

664
01:21:10,407 --> 01:21:12,242
Glad you could make it.

665
01:21:13,953 --> 01:21:15,828
Things have a way of comin' around.

666
01:21:22,253 --> 01:21:24,337
You know, Mr. Chaney, I envy you.

667
01:21:24,421 --> 01:21:28,758
Must be excitin' to bet more money
than you can afford to lose.

668
01:21:32,346 --> 01:21:34,389
What?

669
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:36,224
Who's gonna hold it?

670
01:21:38,769 --> 01:21:40,186
He is.

671
01:21:44,483 --> 01:21:49,862
It doesn't matter what you do.
You're always gonna smell like fish.

672
01:23:04,146 --> 01:23:06,981
That got him.

673
01:23:32,174 --> 01:23:34,175
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

674
01:25:03,015 --> 01:25:05,308
Come on.

675
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:06,828
Use 'em.

676
01:26:06,912 --> 01:26:09,956
- Foul! Get those palmers out of here.
- Use 'em!

677
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:12,792
- Goddamn it! Use 'em!
- Forfeit! Forfeit!

678
01:26:12,876 --> 01:26:15,670
By God!

679
01:27:20,986 --> 01:27:22,778
You owe me money.

680
01:27:26,867 --> 01:27:29,285
You know, you cost me a great deal.

681
01:27:30,829 --> 01:27:32,872
You'll live with it.

682
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:41,547
Mr. Chaney, it's been
a pleasure watchin' you work.

683
01:27:43,634 --> 01:27:47,970
Well, you know, Chick, like old mama said,

684
01:27:48,055 --> 01:27:50,890
"Next best thing to playin' and winnin'...

685
01:27:50,974 --> 01:27:53,935
Is playin' and losin'."

686
01:27:54,061 --> 01:27:57,647
I'll see you around.
Adios.

687
01:28:42,693 --> 01:28:45,277
Sure this is far as you wanna go?

688
01:28:45,362 --> 01:28:47,989
Yeah, I'm sure.

689
01:28:49,533 --> 01:28:52,201
Hey, Poe.

690
01:28:52,285 --> 01:28:56,372
I got a cat back at my place.

691
01:28:57,708 --> 01:28:59,959
I want you to take care of it for me.

692
01:29:01,461 --> 01:29:03,713
That's a lot of money.

693
01:29:05,465 --> 01:29:07,133
You take care of Poe.

694
01:29:10,262 --> 01:29:13,264
For a man who came to town
to make some money,

695
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:15,391
you're sure givin' a lot of it away.

696
01:29:15,475 --> 01:29:18,894
You're forgetting about the in-betweens.

697
01:29:21,732 --> 01:29:23,983
Yeah, I guess you filled them out all right.

698
01:29:28,739 --> 01:29:32,283
Uh, well, where are you off to?

699
01:29:35,662 --> 01:29:37,496
North.

700
01:29:37,581 --> 01:29:40,082
Well, Chaney?

701
01:29:45,922 --> 01:29:47,757
We ought to say somethin'.

702
01:30:10,781 --> 01:30:12,990
Maybe we ought to head on down to Miami.

703
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:18,329
Get into some of that action down there, huh?

704
01:30:19,706 --> 01:30:22,166
It's a hell of a town, you know.

705
01:30:29,132 --> 01:30:32,134
Right on that warm oceanfront.

706
01:30:33,595 --> 01:30:37,765
Fine salt sea air.

707
01:30:37,849 --> 01:30:40,059
Be good for our health.

708
01:30:40,143 --> 01:30:42,061
Uh-huh.

709
01:30:43,563 --> 01:30:45,981
Oh, he sure was somethin'.

710
01:30:48,485 --> 01:30:50,653
Let's go get the cat.

711
01:30:52,322 --> 01:30:55,157
Yeah.
