that you've been sent here...

...is because they wanted you
to be evaluated.

you're mentally ill.

...five arrests for assault.

136
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,436
What can you tell me about that?

137
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,073

and he's a millionaire.

-That's true.
-That is true.

140
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,720
Of course, it's true that you went in for...

141
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,755
...statutory rape.

142
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,751
That's true, is it not, this time?

143
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,195
McMURPHY: Absolutely true. But, Doc...

144
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,431
...she was 15 years old going on 35, Doc...

145
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,432
...and she told me she was 18,
and she was...

146
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,994
McMURPHY: ...very willing,
you know what I mean?

147
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,833
I practically had to take
to sewing my pants shut.

148
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,398
But between you and me...

149
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,790
...she might have been 15.
When you get that little red beaver...

150
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,713
...right there in front of you,
I don't think it's crazy at all.

151
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,994
And I don't think you do, either.

152
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,559
I hear what you're saying.

153
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,631
McMURPHY:
No man alive could resist that.

154
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,676
That's why I got into jail to begin with.

155
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,751
Now they're telling me
I'm crazy over here...

156
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,400
...'cause I don't sit there
like a goddamn vegetable.

157
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,516
It don't make a bit of sense to me.

158
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,511
If that's what being crazy is...

159
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,115
...then I'm senseless, out of it,
gone down the road, whacko.

160
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,788
McMURPHY: But, no more, no less.
That's it.

161
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,910
To be honest with you, McMurphy...

162
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,792
...what it says here...

163
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,393
SPIVEY: ...is that...

164
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,559
...they think...

165
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,433
They think...

166
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,390
...you've been faking it
in order to get out of your work detail.

167
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,277
SPIVEY: What do you think about that?

168
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,669
Do I look like that kind of guy to you?

169
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,948
Well...

170
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,429
Let's just be frank for a minute.
All right, Randall, if you would.

171
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,675
Tell me...

172
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,077
Do you think there's anything wrong
with your mind, really?

173
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,953
Not a thing, Doc.

174
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,318
I'm a goddamn marvel of modern science.

175
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,548
Well...

176
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,356
You're going to be here for a period,

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,873
TABER: I'll bet.

516
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,678

[Skipped item nr. 517]

518
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,710
RATCHED: Last time we were discussing...

519
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,916
...Mr. Harding and the problem
with his wife...

520
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,719
...and I think we were making
a lot of progress.

521
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,750
So who would like to begin today?

522
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,194
Mr. McMurphy?

523
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,353
I've been thinking about
what you said about...

524
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,759
[Clears his throat]

525
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,354
...you know, getting things off your chest.

526
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,589
Well, there's a couple of things
that I'd like to get off my chest.

527
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,519
Well, that's very good, Mr. McMurphy.
Go ahead.

528
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,670
McMURPHY: Today, as you may
or may not know, it doesn't matter...

529
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,035
...is the opening of the World Series.

530
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:07,038
What I'd like to suggest is that
we change the work detail tonight...

531
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,755
...so that we can watch the ball game.

532
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,433
RATCHED: Well, Mr. McMurphy,
what you're asking...

533
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,952
...is that we change
a very carefully worked out schedule.

534
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,551
A little change never hurt, huh?

535
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,313
A little variety?

536
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,072
RATCHED: Well, it's not necessarily true,
Mr. McMurphy.

537
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:33,551
Some men on the ward take a long,
long time to get used to the schedule.

538
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,352
Change it now,
and they might find it very disturbing.

539
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,910
Fuck the schedule! They can go back
to the schedule after the Series.

540
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,753
I'm talking about the World Series,
Nurse Ratched.

541
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,913
Well, anyway, this is no way
to proceed about this.

542
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,240
RATCHED: How would it be
if we had a vote...

543
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,077
...and let the majority rule?

544
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,117
Great. Let's vote on it.

545
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,639
So, all those in favor raise your hands.

546
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,678

548
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:16,034
What's the matter with you?
Don't you want to watch the World Series?

549
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,636
Get your hands up.
It can do you some good...

550
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,871
...to get some exercise,
putting your arms up in the air.

551
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,591

553
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,791
I watch the Series.
I haven't missed the Series in years.

554

they run it there or they'll have a riot.

RATCHED: Well, Mr. McMurphy,
I only count three votes, and...

557
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,719

through the hall...

wet our whistles...

00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,112
...because I don't...

687
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,193
CHESWICK: Mr. McMurphy...

688
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,670
He said something yesterday
about a World Series.

689
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,353
A baseball game?

690
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,750
CHESWICK: You know, and I've never been
to a baseball game and...

691
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,990
...I think I'd like to see one.

692
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,391
That would be good therapy, too,
wouldn't it, Miss Ratched?

693
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,590
I thought we'd decided that issue.

694
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,115
I don't think so, because, I mean...

695
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,993
...we discussed that yesterday...

696
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,670
...and we have a new game today,
I think, don't we, Mac?

697
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,357
That's right, Ches, and we want
a new vote on it, don't we?

698
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,918
Would one more vote satisfy you,
Mr. McMurphy?

699
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,555
Yeah.

700
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,473
It'd satisfy me.

701
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,351
There's a vote before the group.

702
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:40,195
Everyone in favor of changing the schedule,
please raise your hand.

703
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,919
McMURPHY: Okay, I want to see the hands.
Come on!

704
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,035
Which one of you nuts has got any guts?

705
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,953
All right. That's it!

706
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,830
I only count nine votes, Mr. McMurphy.

707
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,797
She only counts nine. Only nine!
It's a landslide.

708
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,351
There are 18 patients
on this ward, Mr. McMurphy...

709
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,951
...and you have to have a majority
to change ward policy.

710
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,112
RATCHED: So you gentlemen
can put your hands down.

711
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,395
McMURPHY: Are you trying to tell me
that you're gonna count these?

712
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,189
These poor sons of bitches,
they don't know what we're talking about.

713
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:33,239
Well, I have to disagree with you,
Mr. McMurphy.

714
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,070
These men are members of the ward,
just as you are.

715
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,354
[Sighs]

716
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,108
All right. All I need is one vote, right?

717
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,639
McMURPHY: Right?

718
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,989
All right.

719
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,188
McMURPHY: Okay.

720
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,230
McMURPHY:
Want to watch the World Series?

721
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,038
This could be a big moment for you.

722
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,712
You want to watch a baseball game?

723
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,994
You want to watch baseball?

724
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,230
Just raise that hand up.
Just raise the hand up.

725
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,039
McMURPHY: What do you say?
PATIENT: I gave it all to her.

726
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,235
Sorry.

727
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,557
McMURPHY: Bancini, old horse.

728
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,393
What do you say?
You want to watch the ball game on TV?

729
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,755
Want to watch the ball game?
Baseball? World Series?

730
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,956
What do you say, pal? You're tired?

731
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,318
Just raise your hand up, Bancini.
Watch the ball game, huh?

732
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,277
I'm tired. Awfully tired.

733
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,634
Okay. All right.

734
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,392
McMURPHY: What about you, pal?

735
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,391
All we need's one vote. Just one vote.

736
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,198
Just your one vote. That's all we need.

737
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,034
Just raise your hand up and your buddies
can watch the baseball game.

738
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,238
General, you remember, don't you?

739
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,550
October, the banner, the stars...

740
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,915
[Sings] "Oh, say can you..."

741
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,230
The World Series.
Raise your hand up, Gen.

742
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,231
[Both sing] "By the dawn's early light..."

743
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,390
McMURPHY: Just raise your hand up.

744
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,593
What about you pal, huh?
Want to watch the ball game?

745
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:54,229
Want to watch the ball game, huh?
Just one vote. Just raise your...

746
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,992
Gentlemen, the meeting is adjourned.

747
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,436
McMURPHY: For Christ's sake,
isn't there one of you fucking maniacs...

748
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,669
...that knows what I'm talking about?

749
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,954
Mr. McMurphy?

750
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,599
The meeting is adjourned.

751
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,750
Just wait a minute, will you?
Just one minute?

752
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,354
You can bring the subject up
again tomorrow.

753
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,993
All right, Chief...

754
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,431
...you're our last chance. What do you say?

755
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,919
Just raise your hand up.

756
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,434
McMURPHY: That's all we need
from you today, Chief.

757
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,158
Just raise your hand up one time.

758
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,470
Show her that you can do it.

759
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,073
Show her that you can still do it.

760
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,674
Just raise your hand up.
All the guys have got them up.

761
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,354
Just raise your hand up, Chief.
Will you? Huh?

762
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:36,069
Come on, there's got to be one guy here
that's not a total fucking nut!

763
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,195
Mac?

764
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,272
McMURPHY: Chief! The Chief!

765
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,554
Aah...!

766
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,434
McMURPHY: Nurse Ratched?
Nurse Ratched, look!

767
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,590
Look. The Chief put his hand up.

768
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,791
The Chief put his hand up. Look, he voted.

769
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,077
McMURPHY: Would you please turn
the television set on?

770
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,674
The Chief has got his hand up, right there.

771
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,919
The Chief voted. Now...

772
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,991
...will you please turn the television set on?

773
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,513
RATCHED: Mr. McMurphy...

774
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,875
...the meeting was adjourned,
and the vote was closed.

775
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:07,475
But the vote was ten to eight.
The Chief, he's got his hand up! Look!

776
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,754
No, Mr. McMurphy.

777
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:12,037
When the meeting was adjourned,
the vote was nine to nine.

778
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,391
Come on, you're not going to say that now!

779
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,038
You're not going to say that now!

780
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,076
You're going to pull that henhouse shit,
now, when the vote...

781
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,912
The Chief just voted! It was ten to nine!

782
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,151
I want that television set turned on!
Right now!

783
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,472
WARREN: Cheswick...

784
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,918
CHESWICK: I want to watch television.
WARREN: No, you have a work assignment.

785
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,752
[Soft dramatic instrumental music,
background]

786
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,035
Koufax.

787
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,478
McMURPHY: Koufax kicks. He delivers.

788
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,313
It's up the middle, it's a base hit.

789
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,391
Richardson's rounding first!
He's going for second!

790
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,833
The ball's in to deep right center!

791
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,592
Davidson, over in the corner,
cuts the ball off!

792
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,557
Here comes the throw.
Richardson's around the dirt!

793
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,392
He slides, he's in there.
He's safe! It's a double!

794
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,436
He's in there, Martini!
Look at Richardson, he's on second base.

795
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,398
Koufax is in big fucking trouble!
Big trouble, baby!

796
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,630
All right, here's Tresh.
He's the next batter!

797
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,472
Tresh looks in. Koufax...

798
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,593
Koufax gets the sign from Roseboro!
He kicks once, he pumps...

799
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:28,309
It's a strike! Koufax's curve ball is
snapping off like a fucking firecracker.

800
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,958
Here he comes with the next pitch.

801
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,396
Tresh swings!
It's a long fly ball to deep left center!

802
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,754
[All cheer]

803
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,229
It's going! It's gone!

804
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,512
[All cheer]

805
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,999
Somebody give me a fucking wiener
before I die.

806
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,312
[Laughter and cheers]

807
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,551
McMURPHY: It's the great Mickey Mantle,
now! Here comes the pitch!

808
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,789
Mantle swings!

809
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,677
It's a fucking home run!

810
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,752
Gentlemen, stop this.

811
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,358
Stop this immediately.

812
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,553
[Cheering continues]

813
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,713
Do you like it here?

814
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,797
That fucking nurse, man!

815
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,958
What do you mean, sir?

816
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,794
She...

817
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,758
She ain't honest.

818
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:37,108
Miss Ratched's one of the finest nurses
we've got in this institution.

819
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,832
McMURPHY: Ha...!

820
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:43,077
Well, I don't want to break up
the meeting or nothing...

821
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,879
...but she's something of a cunt,
ain't she, Doc?

822
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,033
How do you mean that?

823
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:52,154
She likes a rigged game,
you know what I mean?

824
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:01,674
Well, you know,
I've been observing you here now...

825
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,637
...for the last four weeks...

826
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,514
...and I don't see any evidence
of mental illness, at all.

827
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,070
I think that you've been trying to put us on,
all this time.

828
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,039
You know, what do you want me to do?
You know.

829
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,874
[Tapping]

830
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,434
You know what I mean? Is that it?

831
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,476
Is that crazy enough for you?

832
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,313
Want me to take a shit on the floor?
Christ!

833
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,828
Have you ever heard the old saying,
"A rolling stone gathers no moss"?

834
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,236
Yeah.

835
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,671
Does that mean something to you?

836
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,189
Uh...

837
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,353
McMURPHY: It's the same as "Don't wash
your dirty underwear in public."

838
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,509
I'm not sure I understand what you mean.

839
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,477
I'm smarter than him, ain't I?

840
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,198
[McMurphy laughs]

841
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,877
McMURPHY: Well that, sort of, has
always meant...

842
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:59,750
...it's hard for something to grow
on something that's moving.

843
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,919
How did you feel about
what happened yesterday?

844
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,471
I wanted to kill... I mean...

845
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,998
[Cackles]

846
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,510
[McMurphy clears his throat]

847
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,189
Do you gentlemen have
any more questions?

848
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,078
I don't have any more, but perhaps you do.

849
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,196
Do you have a question, McMurphy?

850
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,956
Where do you suppose she lives?

851
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,032
[Door rattles]

852
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,512
Chief, come on with me.

853
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,558
McMURPHY:
We'll show these guys who's nuts.

854

01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:25,390
Well, you're not. You're not!

1194
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:28,677
You're no crazier than the average asshole
walking around on the streets.

1195
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,034
And that's it.

1196
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:33,832
McMURPHY: Jesus Christ, I can't believe it!

1197
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,551
Those are very challenging observations
you made, Randall.

1198
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:46,199
I'm sure some of the men
would like to comment.

1199
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,074
Mr. Scanlon?

1200
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:57,118
I want to know why the dorm is locked
in the daytime and on weekends.

1201
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:00,272
[McMurphy sighs]

1202
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,868
I would like to know about our cigarettes.

1203
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,674
May I have my cigarettes,
please, Miss Ratched?

1204
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:13,719
You sit down, Mr. Cheswick,
and wait your turn.

1205
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,519
Go ahead, sit down!

1206
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:29,152
To answer your question
about the dorm, Mr. Scanlon...

1207
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:30,992
RATCHED: You know very well...

1208
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:35,392
...that if we left the door open, you'd just
go right back to bed after breakfast.

1209
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,794
Am I right?

1210
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:38,429
So what?

1211
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:41,910
May I have my cigarettes,
please, Miss Ratched?

1212
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,638
Forget the cigarettes, Cheswick.

1213
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:46,314
Cigarettes are not important.
Sit down, will you?

1214
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,356
McMURPHY: For Christ's sake!

1215
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,558
McMURPHY: Cigarettes!

1216
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:58,198
Remember, Mr. Scanlon,
we've discussed many times...

1217
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:02,593
...that time spent in the company of others
is very therapeutic.

1218
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:06,759
While time spent brooding alone
only increases a feeling of separation.

1219
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,872
You remember that, don't you?

1220
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,473
Do you mean to say...

1221
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,714
...it's sick to want to be off by yourself?

1222
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,796
CHESWICK: Miss Ratched?

1223
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,750
Mr. Cheswick, you sit down!

1224
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:22,116
CHESWICK: I want to know about...
RATCHED: Sit down, Mr. Cheswick.

1225
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:23,428
I want to...

1226
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:26,236
Give him a cigarette, will you, Harding?

1227
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:27,799
It's my last one.

1228
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:31,518
That's a fucking lie.
Why don't you give him a cigarette?

1229
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:34,160
HARDING: Look, I'm not running
a charity ward, see?

1230
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:35,389
Come on!

1231
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:37,789
CHESWICK:
Look, I don't want his cigarettes.

1232
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:40,348
And I don't want his, or his, or his...

1233
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:43,512
...or his, or his, or his...

1234
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:45,313
Or even yours.

1235
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:47,038
Do you understand that?

1236
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,839
CHESWICK: I want my cigarettes,
Miss Ratched!

1237
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,996
I want my cigarettes!

1238
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,509
I want mine, Miss Ratched!

1239
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,910
CHESWICK: What gives you
the damn right...

1240
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,470
...to keep our cigarettes
piled up on your desk...

1241
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:04,195
...and to squeeze out a pack
only when you feel like it, huh?

1242
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:08,429
CHESWICK: Miss Ratched!
McMURPHY: Mr. Harding!

1243
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,875
[Outburst of giggles, background]

1244
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:11,995
Oh, I'm sorry.

1245
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:15,117
RATCHED: You surprise me.
HARDING: I lost my head. I'm sorry.

1246
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,838
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

1247
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:19,115
I'm really very sorry. I just forgot.

1248
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:22,272
I didn't mean to.
I'm really very sorry. I just forgot.

1249
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:23,748
It's all right.

1250
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:25,838
CHESWICK: Miss Ratched!

1251
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:27,713
Yes, Mr. Cheswick?

1252
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:30,110
I asked you a question!

1253
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,870
I heard your question, Mr. Cheswick...

1254
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:37,075
...and I will answer your question
as soon as you've calmed down.

1255
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,311
Are you calm, Mr. Cheswick?

1256
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:46,030
CHESWICK: I'm calm.
RATCHED: Good.

1257
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:50,432
Now, as you all know, Mr. McMurphy...

1258
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:53,796
...has been running
a small gambling casino in our tub room.

1259
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:58,629
RATCHED: Now, most of you lost
all your cigarettes to Mr. McMurphy...

1260
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:01,917
...not to mention a tidy sum of money
to Mr. McMurphy.

1261
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:04,719
RATCHED: And that's why...

1262
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,633
...your tub room privileges
have been suspended...

1263
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:10,634
...and your cigarettes have been rationed.

1264
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:15,234
Mr. Martini?

1265
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,469
How are we going to win our money back?

1266
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:21,278
[McMurphy chuckles]

1267
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:26,951
You're not going to win
your money back, Mr. Martini.

1268
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:28,798
RATCHED: That's all over.

1269
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:31,075
If you had obeyed the rules
in the first place...

1270
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:33,390
...you wouldn't have lost your money.

1271
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:36,119
[Taber screams and yells hysterically]

1272
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:45,397
Sit down, gentlemen!
Sit down, gentlemen! Sit down!

1273
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:47,471
[Taber continues yelling]

1274
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:52,833
CHESWICK: Rules?

1275
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:55,434
Piss on your fucking rules, Miss Ratched!

1276
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:56,839
Sit down, will you, Cheswick!

1277
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:59,753
I want you to know something
right here and now, Miss Ratched!

1278
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,796
I ain't no little kid! I ain't no little kid!

1279
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:03,233
RATCHED: You sit down!

1280
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:06,392
CHESWICK: Where you're going to have
cigarettes kept from me like cookies...

1281
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,948
And I want something done!
Ain't that right, Mac?

1282
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,553
That's right! Will you sit down!

1283
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,949
No, I won't! I won't!

1284

Hey, calm down!

1293
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,674
McMURPHY: Why don't you
leave him alone, Washington?

1294
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:36,432
He's going to be all right!

1295

We need this chair.

Now you feel better, don't you?

1895
01:58:35,360 --> 01:58:36,588
Yes, ma'am.

Jim, I'm telling you,
McMurphy is upstairs...

1905
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:04,832
...and he's as meek as a lamb.

1906
01:59:04,920 --> 01:59:05,875
Really?

1908
01:59:08,760 --> 01:59:10,318
Jack Dunphy told me.

1909
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:12,517

I was waiting for you.

1917
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:12,632
Now we can make it, Mac.
