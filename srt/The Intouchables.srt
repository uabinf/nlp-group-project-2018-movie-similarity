3
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:36,583
Get out of my way!

4
00:01:58,708 --> 00:01:59,875
Ok, here they are.

5
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:03,792
Philippe, wake up now, I bet
you 100 € that I'll lose them.

6
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,125
- Philippe?
- Deal.

7
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,833
Let's do this!

8
00:02:30,292 --> 00:02:32,792
Gosh, you're on a good night.

9
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,583
Fuck.

10
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,183
You lost them alright.

11
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:52,833
Get out of the car!
Hands on the hood!

12
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,333
- I double.
- 200 € that they're escorting us.

13
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,125
You're gonna lose again.

14
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,083
- 200 €!
- Deal.

15
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,792
Come on! Show me your hands!

16
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,750
Your hands goddammit!

17
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:07,292
- Wait. I'm gonna explain.
- Shut up. Hands on the hood.

18
00:03:07,792 --> 00:03:10,833
- Wait.
- Get out of the car. Now!

19
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,792
Take it easy!

20
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,542
He can't get out.
He can't even open the door.

21
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:19,375
Look at him for god's sake!

22
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:24,167
There's a wheel chair in the trunk.
He's disabled. Go check!

23
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:25,875
Get off me.

24
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,917
- He's telling the truth.
- So!

25
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:32,667
What did you think?

26
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:36,000
You think I'm driving that fast.
For the fun of it?

27
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:40,542
I was going to the hospital.
I'm working for him. He's having a stroke!

28
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,986
The more we wait, the worse it gets.

29
00:03:41,987 --> 00:03:43,958
He can't move, he can't do anything.
That's why I'm here.

30
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:46,125
I think we have a problem here.

31
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,458
Come see this.

32
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:54,958
- What the fuck do we do now?
- That's right, think about it. Take your time.

33
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,208
But meanwhile call his 15 years old daughter
and tell his father is dead because of you!

34
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,833
Because if he's not taken care
of within 5 minutes, it's over.

35
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,417
But take your time.

36
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:09,458
Think. Think fast. He's dying!

37
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:13,750
Alright, don't waste any more time.
Go.

38
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,875
- Where are you going?
- ER.

39
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:33,375
We're gonna escort you, it's safer.
Let's go, we're escorting them!

40
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,875
They're gone. They're leaving.

41
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:38,375
Good.

42
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,167
Philippe, this is so gross.

43
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,583
You fool me every time with that.
How do you produce this...

44
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:47,875
Alright, you'll really have to
get your license eventually.

45
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,292
Yes, but meanwhile:
"we're gonna escort you, it's safer".

46
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,250
A 200 € escort.

47
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,792
What? I never bet such
amounts of money.

48
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,542
Let's celebrate a little bit.

49
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,208
"We're gonna escort you, it's safer."

50
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:04,333
Cool it. I helped you big time.

51
00:05:04,542 --> 00:05:08,550
Philippe, an escort.
A safe escort!

52
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:49,083
Here he comes.

53
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,250
We took care of it.
A stretcher will be here in a second.

54
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
- Are you gonna be ok?
- Yeah, it's fine.

55
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,833
- Good luck.
- Whatever.

56
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,208
Now what?

57
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,208
Now you let me handle it.

58
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:32,708
THE INTOUCHABLES

59
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:38,125
<i>Based on a true story.</i>

60
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,583
Do you have references?

61
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,375
Well yes. I validated my CAFAD.

62
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,542
A certificate of aptitude to
take care of disabled persons.

63
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,250
I validated it in a renowned institute
in the Landes country in 2001

64
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,333
I have a high school
"Proximity Services" diploma

65
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:41,208
and a bachelor's in
"Social and Familial Economy"

66
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:47,125
I don't... like... I mean...
I have been mostly studying rather than working.

67
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:49,500
What is your main motivation?

68
00:08:49,792 --> 00:08:51,625
Money!

69
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,333
Mankind.

70
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,792
I'm all about mankind.

71
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,292
Good for you.

72
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,500
To help others, I think.
It's good right? It's a good answer?

73
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,042
I like the neighbourhood.

74
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,167
I love disabled persons.
Since I was a little child actually.

75
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:11,417
To promote disabled
people's autonomy, I'd say.

76
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:12,667
Their social insertion.

77
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:15,542
Sports too.
You gotta move, you know.

78
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:17,750
For the social life, I mean.

79
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,625
These people can't do anything...

80
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,900
I saw... had my first
professional experience...

81
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,833
It was Mme Dupont-Moretti.

82
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:29,167
A really old lady...

83
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
really old...

84
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,250
I assisted her...

85
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,667
until the end, day after day.

86
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:40,583
In geriatrics there were good times too.
We had King's cake... er...

87
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:44,792
Oh... I'm also an expert
in administrative stuff...

88
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,792
Financial aid... Welfare...

89
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:50,667
I... I don't know...

90
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:51,958
maybe you qualify?

91
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:55,292
You'll check, Magali.
But I don't think so...

92
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:04,917
- Yvan Laprade?
- Yes.

93
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,217
- No, no, no. Get lost...
- But it's my turn now.

94
00:10:07,325 --> 00:10:10,417
I've been waiting for 2 hours.
My turn...

95
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:16,417
Hello.

96
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,458
I'm coming to have a paper signed.

97
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,667
Please take a seat.

98
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,250
Do you have references?

99
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,292
References? I do.

100
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,542
So?

101
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:32,750
We're all ears.

102
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,000
"Kool & the Gang",
"Earth, Wind & Fire".

103
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:39,042
Those are good references,
aren't they?

104
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,917
I don't know them. Take a seat.

105
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,583
If you don't know them,
you don't know anything about music.

106
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,458
I don't think I'm ignorant
when it comes to music.

107
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,917
- Even if I don't know you "Sool" whatever...
- No.

108
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,167
"Kool & the Gang".

109
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,250
What about you?
You know Chopin, Schubert, Berlioz?

110
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:56,292
You're asking me
if I know Berlioz?

111
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,500
I'd be surprised if you knew
anything about Berlioz.

112
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:00,458
I'm a specialist, though.

113
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:01,917
Oh, really...

114
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:04,125
Who do you know there?

115
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:08,583
- Which building?
- What do you mean which building?

116
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:09,875
But, man...

117
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,875
Berlioz was a famous composer before
your residency was called after him.

118
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,500
Writer, critic of the 19th century.

119
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,542
It's a joke. I know who Berlioz is.
But I see humour is like music for you.

120
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,375
You don't know anything about it.

121
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:30,083
Tell us about your paper.

122
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:35,625
I need a signature...
To prove I came to the interview.

123
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:40,333
Just write that "unfortunately,
despite my obvious qualities..."

124
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,208
Whatever usual bullshit you use
to say you're still not interested.

125
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:44,500
I need 3 rebuffs to get welfare money again.

126
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,708
I understand, welfare.

127
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,583
- You don't have any other motivation in life?
- Oh, yes, I do.

128
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:55,417
There's one right here.
This here is really motivating...

129
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:59,792
So, it's not that I'm bored but,
what's happening now?

130
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:01,625
Signing? Not signing?

131
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,958
I'm sorry I can't sign it right now.

132
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:05,000
Why is that?

133
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,458
Why?

134
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,917
That must be a bit annoying.

135
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,542
Because I have a deadline,
and since I'm pretty late...

136
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,792
It's "a bit annoying", indeed.

137
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,292
Can't the motivation sign for you?

138
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:31,417
No, Magali can't do that.

139
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,500
It's a shame.

140
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:36,667
She could have dropped in
her number as well.

141
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,292
You'll have to come back tomorrow.

142
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,375
9 a.m. Your paper will be signed.

143
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,167
I certainly wouldn't want to deprive
you from welfare.

144
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,750
- Sorry I can't walk you to the door.
- It's all good.

145
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,583
Don't get up. I mean...
Stay seated.

146
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:51,000
See you tomorrow.

147
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,250
- Nina?
- Yeah?

148
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,708
- Is she here?
- No. She'll be back late.

149
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:47,125
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no. Hey!

150
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:50,625
Don't use it now. Turn it off.
It's using all the water.

151
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:52,200
Stop the water!

152
00:13:52,308 --> 00:13:54,375
And get out. Get out!

153
00:13:54,525 --> 00:13:56,017
- I'm showering, what are you doing here?
- Leave me alone!

154
00:13:56,155 --> 00:13:57,117
Get out!

155
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,167
Make them leave. Come on.

156
00:14:00,417 --> 00:14:02,375
Bitou, I'm not joking.

157
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:03,917
Mina! Mina?

158
00:14:04,383 --> 00:14:05,833
Get out, fatso!

159
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,000
Let it go!

160
00:14:09,292 --> 00:14:11,042
Give me a towel.
Why are you still here...

161
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,458
Get out, all of you!
They don't get it!

162
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:13,875
Bitou, come one.

163
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,333
Hey! Bitou!

164
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:16,792
What do you think you're doing?

165
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,917
Sit down.

166
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,083
What do you want?
Coca-Cola or this one?

167
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:23,333
I want Coca-Cola.

168
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,250
- Where do you come from?
- School.

169
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:43,208
Can you wipe the trash can?

170
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:45,750
Where are you going now?

171
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,625
Horse-riding.

172
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,833
That's right, be a smart ass.

173
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,125
It's for you.

174
00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:34,000
Where have you been?

175
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,750
- Holidays.
- Holidays?

176
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,125
You think people don't talk around here?

177
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,208
That I'm incredibly stupid?

178
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,042
You've been gone for 6 months.
Not one phone call. Nothing.

179
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:48,625
And you come back, as if nothing
happened, giving me a Kinder egg?

180
00:15:48,917 --> 00:15:51,583
Do you think I'm gonna
pay the rent with that?

181
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,708
The groceries?

182
00:15:56,733 --> 00:15:59,292
Do you think it's a hotel here?

183
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,458
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

184
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,167
Moron.

185
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,208
- It's impossible to talk with you.
- You want to talk?

186
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:11,708
Alright.

187
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,875
I'm listening.

188
00:16:21,292 --> 00:16:23,958
I'm listening now.

189
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,917
You know Driss...

190
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:30,333
I prayed a lot for you.

191
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,000
But God forgive me...

192
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,208
I have other children.

193
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:39,375
I still have hope for them.

194
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,958
I don't want to see you
around here any more.

195
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:46,417
You're taking all your stuff.

196
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:48,042
And you get the fuck out of here.

197
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:50,042
Got it?

198
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,583
Leave.

199
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:55,917
Leave!

200
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:19,917
Let him eat his sandwich, guys.

201
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:22,917
Don't give him anything!

202
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,167
...and he's gone!

203
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,333
It's a good one, right?

204
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:19,433
- Ok, I'm off.
- You don't think it was funny?

205
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,583
You don't think it was funny?

206
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,167
Yes?

207
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,958
- I'm here for my paper.
- Yes, I was waiting for you.

208
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:24,917
- You know... the welfare.
- Get in.

209
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:37,750
Can you tell Philippe
the young man is here?

210
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Of course.

211
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,333
- So?
- The beets are not quite done.

212
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,633
- But the radish are almost good.
- Fine.

213
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,033
Hi.

214
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,167
Let's go.

215
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:04,333
Just so you know,
he's had a rough night.

216
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,250
Just like you, apparently.

217
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,583
The day starts at 7 a.m. sharp

218
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:10,583
with the nurse.

219
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:14,042
He needs 2 to 3 hours
of care every morning.

220
00:20:14,292 --> 00:20:17,500
I'm warning you. Most people
give up after a week.

221
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,833
They come and go pretty fast.

222
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:21,083
Well...

223
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:24,250
I like the furniture, the music,
it's cool and all...

224
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:25,875
but I don't think I'll buy it.

225
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,167
And I don't have the whole day.

226
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:31,167
Listen, I was asked to give you a tour,
believe me I too have other fish to fry.

227
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,042
It's almost done anyway.

228
00:20:33,292 --> 00:20:35,542
Here, you can communicate
with a babyphone.

229
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,375
It's like a Walkie-Talkie.
You hear him, he hears you.

230
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:42,708
According to the contract,
you also have your own room.

231
00:20:42,917 --> 00:20:45,083
Here, the toilets.

232
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:50,875
And there a private bathroom.

233
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,458
Hello?

234
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,708
It's here.

235
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:13,375
He's waiting for you.

236
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:16,375
Just a minute...

237
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,375
So I signed your paper.

238
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:32,542
It's in an envelope,
on the little table.

239
00:21:37,792 --> 00:21:40,917
By the way, how do you like it
relying on others for a living?

240
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:41,917
What?

241
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,200
You don't have a problem living
from other people's work?

242
00:21:44,383 --> 00:21:47,100
Any conscience issues?

243
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,833
I'm good, what about you?

244
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,208
Do you think you'd be able to work?

245
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,250
I mean with a contract, a schedule,

246
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:57,917
responsibilities.

247
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:00,667
I was wrong. You are funny.

248
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,792
I'm so funny I'm ready to take you on
on a one month trial.

249
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,333
Do you want the day to think about it?

250
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,333
I bet you won't make it past two weeks.

251
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:40,125
What?

252
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:43,850
You can't forget a single bone
or a single muscle.

253
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:45,000
Everything has to move.

254
00:22:45,292 --> 00:22:48,208
We want to keep the skin
and the joints healthy.

255
00:22:48,442 --> 00:22:52,500
In order to achieve this,
you're going to have to be very meticulous.

256
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,708
Rigorous.

257
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,958
Ok? You get it?

258
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,833
Hey, wake up!

259
00:22:58,083 --> 00:22:59,292
Sleep at night.

260
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:02,083
- I'm not sleeping.
- Come help me.

261
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:05,708
We're going to bring
Philippe to his chair.

262
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,917
And then, to the shower.

263
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:11,208
You know what?

264
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:13,600
Try yourself. Show me.

265
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:22,708
Don't be afraid. Go ahead.

266
00:23:22,917 --> 00:23:24,500
I'm not afraid.

267
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,625
- There. Good enough?
- Wait!

268
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:43,125
Never let him go
until he's all strapped.

269
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,375
It's one of my sins.

270
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:47,500
She didn't tell me.

271
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:51,142
I'm in training.

272
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:55,583
Do you need gloves or what?
Rub harder, for god's sake.

273
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:58,792
It doesn't foam!
It's a weird shampoo.

274
00:23:59,042 --> 00:24:00,625
- How is it going?
- I'm washing his hair...

275
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:02,042
but it doesn't foam.

276
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,250
What do you mean?

277
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,958
What the hell...
are you kidding me?

278
00:24:06,292 --> 00:24:08,375
You're washing his hair
with his foot cream!

279
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:09,875
Wait, wait...

280
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:14,792
Please tell me you can read.

281
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,833
You look really talented, don't you?

282
00:24:17,042 --> 00:24:19,500
They look exactly the same.
Why isn't there only one for everything?

283
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,875
There are 20 of them.

284
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:24,542
Ok, let's move on now.
I won't stay here for 2 hours.

285
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,500
- So I'm using this one?
- The one that says "shampoo".

286
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:32,542
- Are you gonna be ok?
- Of course, he'll be ok.

287
00:24:32,792 --> 00:24:35,167
My feet have never been styled so well.

288
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:38,375
Go have your lunch, Marcelle.
Everything is fine.

289
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,875
Wow, do these come with a skirt?

290
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:46,167
Those are compression stockings.
If I don't wear them, my blood won't flow

291
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:48,500
and I'll pass out.

292
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:53,625
I'm not putting stockings on you.

293
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:55,667
We're gonna have a problem here.

294
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:59,500
Since I won't do it, we'll have to...
at some point... I mean...

295
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:01,708
we'll have to figure out if...
Marcelle!

296
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,208
Maybe she can come back...

297
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:06,042
and do it herself.

298
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,583
Since she's a girl and everything,
she knows how to.

299
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,208
I don't even know why we're debating,
I'm not gonna do it.

300
00:25:12,417 --> 00:25:15,467
Even for you, at this point
you'd probably better pass out...

301
00:25:15,558 --> 00:25:21,833
You have to say no, to stand up for yourself.
Marcelle! We're not wearing them!

302
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:36,333
What's the matter? You're putting stockings on me,
you have a cute little earring. I think it's coherent.

303
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:39,083
Easy on the sass, alright?

304
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:41,542
Looks like you have experience...

305
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:45,042
No? You never thought about...

306
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:48,833
starting a beauty salon or something?

307
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:52,750
All right. Done.

308
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,750
Now what are these gloves for?

309
00:25:54,958 --> 00:25:57,208
Er... we're going to wait
a while more for this.

310
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,167
You're not quite ready.

311
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:01,167
No. He's not quite ready.

312
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:04,167
What do you mean, Marcelle?

313
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:06,708
- What is that?
- We'll explain at some point.

314
00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:08,500
Marcelle, we have to talk...

315
00:26:08,792 --> 00:26:10,708
There's a problem with the training.

316
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:13,875
It's not about being ready.
I do not do that.

317
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:16,167
I don't empty a stranger's butt.

318
00:26:16,417 --> 00:26:18,250
I don't even empty a friend's butt.

319
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,833
I usually don't empty butts.

320
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:22,083
It's a matter of principles.

321
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:26,333
Can we talk about this later?
When I'm done eating, for example?

322
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:31,667
No.

323
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:34,500
No use speaking about it later.
I'm done with this.

324
00:26:34,708 --> 00:26:36,792
It's weird argument, I don't like it.

325
00:26:36,958 --> 00:26:40,250
I didn't say anything about the stockings.
But it costs me.

326
00:26:40,542 --> 00:26:43,000
I'm making compromises,
please do the same for me.

327
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:46,708
- I'm done with the butt-emptying issue.
- I think I get it.

328
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:48,667
It's not right. I'm done.

329
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:51,000
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

330
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:59,500
- Pretty, huh?
- I love it.

331
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:07,167
Am I bothering you?

332
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,458
Is it a theatre or what?

333
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:11,583
- I'm trying to eat here.
- Hey, what's up?

334
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:16,583
- Do you know where I can find a beer?
- Try in your hair.

335
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:19,583
We had two 6-packs,
did you take them?

336
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,708
I don't know. I don't care.

337
00:27:20,917 --> 00:27:23,000
So take your feather duster
with you and leave.

338
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,625
Come on, let's get out of here.

339
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:27,917
- It's the new guy working for my father.
- Right!

340
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:30,917
The "guy" has a name you know.

341
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:57,458
Damn.

342
00:27:57,667 --> 00:27:58,833
- What?
- Sorry.

343
00:27:59,042 --> 00:28:00,542
- What happened?
- Nothing.

344
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,625
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

345
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:05,292
I'm massaging.

346
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:19,583
That is nuts.

347
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:23,375
Are you having fun?

348
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:26,083
You don't feel anything down there!

349
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:27,125
What the hell...

350
00:28:27,417 --> 00:28:29,875
- What are you doing again?
- Experiments.

351
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,250
He doesn't give a shit,
he feels nothing! Look!

352
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:33,417
Stop it, you're gonna burn him.

353
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:44,083
Lawyer.

354
00:28:44,917 --> 00:28:46,333
Lawyer.

355
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:51,417
No... this is personal.
I'll read it later.

356
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:53,875
Personal file?

357
00:28:55,292 --> 00:28:56,417
Ok.

358
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:02,083
Trash.

359
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:03,917
She has a little something, though.

360
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:07,708
Can't we create a hooker file?

361
00:29:13,667 --> 00:29:16,417
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thanks.

362
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,083
Please.

363
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,667
Sorry.

364
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,333
I'm sorry.

365
00:29:39,292 --> 00:29:41,417
Fuck. I keep forgetting.

366
00:29:44,042 --> 00:29:45,917
Fuck, sorry.

367
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:54,208
That's good.

368
00:29:56,292 --> 00:29:57,375
Driss?

369
00:29:57,667 --> 00:29:59,250
Can you come?

370
00:29:59,458 --> 00:30:01,333
Can you hear me, Driss?

371
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,167
Can you please come?

372
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:06,750
Driss.

373
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:09,292
Driss. Can you hear me?

374
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:17,125
What?

375
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:20,000
It's almost 9.
Philippe is waiting.

376
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:23,250
It's 9 already? I lost track of time,
it took forever for my bath to foam.

377
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:26,792
- This room's a piggery.
- Make me a coffee, I'm coming.

378
00:30:26,917 --> 00:30:29,917
You're supposed to keep the babyphone
with you at all times..

379
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:34,667
And I want Nutella! Not the jams
with weird fruits that nobody knows of.

380
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:56,167
I'm not going in there.

381
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:57,792
Even you!

382
00:30:57,917 --> 00:31:01,958
I'm not gonna load you in
the back like a horse.

383
00:31:02,792 --> 00:31:04,625
What about this one?

384
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:07,417
This one is not fit for me.

385
00:31:09,875 --> 00:31:14,833
- What do you mean?
- Unfortunately, I have to be pragmatic.

386
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,792
Pragmatic?

387
00:31:20,417 --> 00:31:22,125
Oh damn!

388
00:31:22,958 --> 00:31:24,417
Son of a...

389
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,125
Feels good, right?

390
00:31:26,292 --> 00:31:28,500
- It does!
- So good.

391
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,000
It's nervous!

392
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:32,333
Let's go.

393
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,750
That's the neighbour again.
He always parks here.

394
00:31:44,958 --> 00:31:48,417
He thinks it's his own parking spot.

395
00:31:49,792 --> 00:31:52,667
I see some change coming.

396
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:56,542
- Hi, how are you?
- What?

397
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:58,792
How is it going Patrick Swayze?
Would you like a cup of coffee?

398
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,875
- Can I see that?
- What the...

399
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:02,125
Come here.

400
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:06,292
Now read this. Read!

401
00:32:06,542 --> 00:32:07,625
"No Parking."

402
00:32:07,833 --> 00:32:10,542
- Louder. I can't hear you.
- That's the way to do it.

403
00:32:10,792 --> 00:32:12,167
- Read the bottom of it.
- "Reserved spot."

404
00:32:12,292 --> 00:32:15,208
Now you print that in your mind
and you get the fuck out of here.

405
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:17,250
Hurry up.

406
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:18,917
Get lost!

407
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,958
We're opening on tuesday.
It will be sold by tuesday night.

408
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:34,083
Can we go? You've been
staring at this for an hour.

409
00:32:34,292 --> 00:32:36,167
You're gonna have to change
the channel at some point.

410
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,708
This painting expresses
an overwhelming serenity.

411
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:40,708
And some violence as well.

412
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,042
I find it very moving.

413
00:32:42,292 --> 00:32:44,708
Red stains on a white background
are moving?

414
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,167
How much for this thing?

415
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:50,250
I think it's 30.000 €.
I can check if you want.

416
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:54,458
You'd better check indeed.
It sounds exaggerated.

417
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:59,333
You're not going pay 30.000 €
for this piece of crap!

418
00:32:59,583 --> 00:33:01,917
- Unbelievable.
- You'd better believe it.

419
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:04,833
This guy nosebleeds on a white
board and asks 30.000 € for it?

420
00:33:05,042 --> 00:33:09,667
Tell me Driss, why do you think
people are interested in art?

421
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:13,458
- I don't know, it's a business.
- No.

422
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:16,458
It's because that's the only print
of our time on earth.

423
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:17,867
That's bullshit, Philippe.

424
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,130
For 50 bucks and a quick stop
at a hardware store,

425
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,167
I can leave something behind as well.

426
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:23,083
I can even add extra blue
for free if you want.

427
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:26,417
Stop talking nonsense.
Give me a M&M's.

428
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,292
No.

429
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:31,333
Give me a M&M's.

430
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:34,792
No feet? No sweets.

431
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:38,875
Hey, I'm joking.

432
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,542
It's a joke!

433
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,875
- Oh, it's a joke!
- Well, yeah!

434
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:45,042
- A joke...
- A good one, right?

435
00:33:45,292 --> 00:33:47,500
Really funny.
Really funny joke.

436
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:48,833
It's a classic.

437
00:33:49,042 --> 00:33:51,542
"No feet? no sweets."
But with you...

438
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,167
Come on.

439
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,167
- It's so good!
- Good joke.

440
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:56,833
Of course!

441
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,542
No legs, Philippe.

442
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:04,083
I'll say it again for Marge Simpson there.
Too bad there's no audience.

443
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:09,750
Sorry, I was wrong about the price.

444
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,083
- Didn't I say so?
- Yes.

445
00:34:11,292 --> 00:34:13,792
It's 41.500 €.

446
00:34:14,042 --> 00:34:15,208
I'll take it.

447
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:17,167
No shit!

448
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:27,833
Hi, Philippe.

449
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:30,417
How are you doing?

450
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:32,875
You summoned me, I'm here.

451
00:34:33,042 --> 00:34:34,333
I'm listening.

452
00:34:34,833 --> 00:34:36,708
What's so important?

453
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:40,208
I didn't "summon" you...

454
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:47,667
Can't you guess?

455
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:51,292
Who is this guy?

456
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,542
Everybody's worried.

457
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:56,542
Yvonne told me he's irresponsible, brutal.

458
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:59,000
He hit a neighbour.

459
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:02,875
Philippe, you know better than
anyone you have to be careful.

460
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:06,292
You can't let anybody in.

461
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:08,917
Especially given your condition...

462
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:10,542
In this case...

463
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:14,917
I'm not quite sure you know
who you're dealing with.

464
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:17,958
Go on...

465
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:20,833
I have my contacts in the police.

466
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:23,167
He's not Al Capone, but...

467
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,333
he's not Mother Teresa either.

468
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:30,042
He's just out of prison.
Six months for robbing a jewelry.

469
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:33,833
If at least he was qualified...

470
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
but I hear he sucks.

471
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:39,708
Be careful. You know guys from
the suburbs have no mercy.

472
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,583
That's it.

473
00:35:42,792 --> 00:35:45,458
That's exactly what I want.
No pity.

474
00:35:46,417 --> 00:35:50,583
He often hands me the phone, you know why?
He just forgets.

475
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:53,708
So you're right.
He doesn't really feel any empathy for me.

476
00:35:53,917 --> 00:35:58,958
But he's tall, strong, healthy,
and not as dumb as you think.

477
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:02,542
So for now, given my
"condition" like you say...

478
00:36:02,667 --> 00:36:06,708
I don't give a damn about where
he comes from and what he's done.

479
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:08,375
As you want.

480
00:36:11,667 --> 00:36:13,542
That's all you wanted to say?

481
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:18,583
Hey, Magali.

482
00:36:18,792 --> 00:36:20,583
- Do you have a minute?
- No, not really.

483
00:36:20,792 --> 00:36:23,458
It'll take only a second.
I just want to show you something.

484
00:36:23,667 --> 00:36:26,792
- What is it?
- Don't freak out, you'll see.

485
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:30,917
- One minute, that's it.
- Come on.

486
00:36:35,667 --> 00:36:38,833
- So?
- So I have a bathtub.

487
00:36:39,042 --> 00:36:40,167
That's it.

488
00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:44,083
- Really fascinating...
- Yeah.

489
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:46,708
- So what?
- I was thinking...

490
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:48,458
we could take a bath.

491
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:50,083
It's big. There's enough room.

492
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:54,125
I have bath salts, shower gel...

493
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:55,792
Alright.

494
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,125
Why not, after all?

495
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:00,750
Exactly. Why not.

496
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:02,333
Go ahead.

497
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:05,667
- Start undressing.
- Oh, you're gonna play it naughty.

498
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:07,125
I like that.

499
00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:10,958
I'm taking off my clothes.
No problem.

500
00:37:13,417 --> 00:37:14,583
What?

501
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,500
Where are you going?

502
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,042
You agreed!

503
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:22,792
We don't even have to use the salts.

504
00:37:25,083 --> 00:37:26,125
What are you looking at?

505
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:30,333
I'm always anxious in the morning,
when the mail arrives.

506
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:32,250
As Apollinaire once said...

507
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:34,292
Quote...

508
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:36,458
"I'm desperate when I
don't hear from you..."

509
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:38,667
Wait. Wait a second.

510
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,833
I'm lost, you're going too fast.

511
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:43,000
I was at: "As Apollinaire
once said...".

512
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:47,333
Quote "I'm desperate when
I don't hear from you..."

513
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:53,583
You might not get it, but
this is an intimate time.

514
00:37:54,042 --> 00:37:56,375
- Nope, I don't get it.
- Give it back.

515
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:58,333
I'll shut it down if you explain.

516
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:00,958
There's nothing to explain.

517
00:38:01,292 --> 00:38:03,167
He's sending letters.

518
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:04,625
Letters?

519
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:07,500
- To whom?
- To women, usually.

520
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:09,708
No kidding. Who is it?

521
00:38:10,167 --> 00:38:13,625
There's one in particular.
Eléonore.

522
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,958
Who is Eléonore?
I've never seen her.

523
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:17,250
How come?

524
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:21,000
That's how epistolary
relationships work.

525
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:25,208
It means they write letters

526
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:27,375
they only communicate by mail.

527
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:30,333
Yeah. I got it.

528
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:34,583
Are those the blue letters?

529
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,458
What a womaniser.

530
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:42,000
He's "epistoling" like a boss.

531
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,667
What about you?

532
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,250
Isn't there someone?

533
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:48,625
Not even Albert, the gardener?

534
00:38:48,833 --> 00:38:51,167
- Not at all.
- Come on, I noticed.

535
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:54,167
He always has a smile for you.

536
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:55,792
Am I right?

537
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:59,500
- Am I right or not?
- Stop it now. It's ridiculous.

538
00:38:59,917 --> 00:39:01,417
So did he get some or what?

539
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:04,917
- What are you talking about?
- Did he plant his little cucumber?

540
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:07,417
What?

541
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:11,792
- I can't believe you...
- Albert, Albert...

542
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:14,125
Soon.

543
00:39:14,292 --> 00:39:16,292
Soon, trust me.

544
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:37,083
Fuck.

545
00:39:40,958 --> 00:39:42,208
Hey...

546
00:39:43,417 --> 00:39:44,583
Are you all right?

547
00:39:49,875 --> 00:39:52,667
Do you need music?

548
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:17,042
Stay calm.

549
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:19,583
Calm down, Philippe.

550
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:30,000
Philippe. Hey, Philippe.

551
00:40:37,167 --> 00:40:38,583
Try to relax.

552
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:40,875
Breathe slowly.

553
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:45,083
Can you hear me?

554
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:55,917
Slowly.

555
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,042
You're gonna be fine.

556
00:41:27,792 --> 00:41:28,917
I need air.

557
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:30,833
Air!

558
00:42:10,333 --> 00:42:13,250
The fresh air feels great.

559
00:42:14,167 --> 00:42:17,583
- What time is it?
- I don't know, around 4 a.m.

560
00:42:19,542 --> 00:42:22,917
It has been a while since I took a walk
in Paris at this time of night.

561
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:25,042
What happened?

562
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:28,167
Medication side effect.

563
00:42:28,458 --> 00:42:31,625
Doctors call these "Ghost pains".

564
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,500
I always say that I'm a frozen steak
thrown in a hot frying pan.

565
00:42:39,042 --> 00:42:42,375
I don't feel anything,
but it's still painful.

566
00:42:44,542 --> 00:42:48,125
It has to stop. There must be
something that will relieve you.

567
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:53,458
Yup. This could relieve me.

568
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:57,458
Well, we're all a little sick
when it comes to this...

569
00:42:57,625 --> 00:43:01,500
I might even be sicker than you.

570
00:43:01,917 --> 00:43:05,917
By the way, I meant to ask you.
About the ladies...

571
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:09,042
Can you...? How does it work?

572
00:43:10,167 --> 00:43:11,667
I have to adapt.

573
00:43:11,833 --> 00:43:14,000
But concretely...
Can you do it or not?

574
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:19,792
Concretely, I don't know if you're aware, but
I can't feel anything from my neck to my toes.

575
00:43:20,375 --> 00:43:22,250
So you can't.

576
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:25,583
It's more complicated than that.

577
00:43:25,792 --> 00:43:28,917
I can, but not always when I want to.

578
00:43:29,042 --> 00:43:30,917
Also, there's pleasure
to be found elsewhere.

579
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:32,292
Really?

580
00:43:32,542 --> 00:43:34,125
You can't imagine.

581
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:37,167
I sure can't. What do you mean?

582
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:40,500
The ears, for instance.

583
00:43:41,292 --> 00:43:42,208
What about the ears?

584
00:43:42,375 --> 00:43:46,792
It's a very sensitive, erogenous area.

585
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,917
So you get your ears licked?

586
00:43:51,417 --> 00:43:53,500
I would never have thought about that.

587
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:58,208
Philippe.

588
00:44:12,625 --> 00:44:15,667
- Hit that. It will help.
- What is this bullshit?

589
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:18,125
Come on, it can't get any worse.

590
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:19,792
Hit it.

591
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,833
Come on, harder.

592
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:24,750
Easy, let's share.

593
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:27,875
More.

594
00:44:31,875 --> 00:44:35,208
- A bit more.
- Enough for tonight.

595
00:44:35,708 --> 00:44:38,708
Sorry to bring this back, but I'm
really curious about the ear thing.

596
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:42,958
So if you have red ears,
it means you're turned on?

597
00:44:43,167 --> 00:44:45,083
That's it.

598
00:44:45,292 --> 00:44:49,042
Sometimes I even wake up with hard lobes.

599
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:52,250
- Both of them?
- Both of them.

600
00:44:54,667 --> 00:44:59,333
I met my wife Alice when we were
studying political sciences. We were 20.

601
00:44:59,542 --> 00:45:01,500
She was tall and elegant.

602
00:45:01,708 --> 00:45:03,792
Joyful bright eyes.

603
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,958
I saw pictures at your place.
It's the blonde one, right?

604
00:45:07,292 --> 00:45:08,250
Not bad.

605
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:10,875
We had an incredible story together.

606
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,792
I wish you the same once in your life.

607
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:17,500
God I loved her so much.
So much...

608
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:30,333
Then she got pregnant once, twice...

609
00:45:30,542 --> 00:45:33,792
She had five miscarriages.

610
00:45:35,917 --> 00:45:41,083
Medical verdict came. Incurable disease.
She was not going to live much longer.

611
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:44,583
We decided to adopt anyway.

612
00:45:56,875 --> 00:45:58,417
Sir?

613
00:45:58,625 --> 00:46:00,542
Please.

614
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,458
Please!

615
00:46:08,542 --> 00:46:09,542
Yes.

616
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:11,250
I want...

617
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:14,083
I'm gonna have a tarte tatin, please.

618
00:46:14,292 --> 00:46:17,717
But this time, cooked all the way.
Because the chocolate cake had a problem.

619
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:20,250
It was runny, all fluid inside...

620
00:46:20,417 --> 00:46:22,592
flowing everywhere.
It was weird.

621
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,958
That's what a "mi-cuit"
is supposed to do, sir.

622
00:46:26,208 --> 00:46:27,958
- That's why?
- Yes.

623
00:46:28,167 --> 00:46:30,083
I'm still gonna have a tarte tatin.

624
00:46:30,292 --> 00:46:32,333
I always liked competition.

625
00:46:32,542 --> 00:46:34,708
Extreme sports, speed...

626
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,833
Going faster, higher...

627
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:40,333
I had it all with paragliding.

628
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,917
I got higher, could see everything.
And breathe.

629
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:48,875
I was raised with the conviction I was
good enough to piss on the whole world.

630
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:52,958
I'd like to drink something.
My mouth feels dry.

631
00:46:54,458 --> 00:46:57,667
That's one of the side effects
when you smoke weed...

632
00:46:57,958 --> 00:47:00,958
- What are the other ones?
- It makes you hungry...

633
00:47:01,167 --> 00:47:03,667
And chatty.

634
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:11,500
And then a day of bad weather, a day
I shouldn't have gone paragliding.

635
00:47:11,875 --> 00:47:13,500
But you did.

636
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:19,125
Maybe to share Alice's pain,
because I knew she wouldn't make it.

637
00:47:19,375 --> 00:47:21,917
In the end, two broken cervical vertebrae.

638
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:24,583
And only my head left to get high.

639
00:47:24,833 --> 00:47:28,958
When the pain goes away,
all I have left is my mind.

640
00:47:30,417 --> 00:47:34,458
My true disability is not
having to be in a wheel chair.

641
00:47:36,292 --> 00:47:38,000
It's to be without her.

642
00:47:41,042 --> 00:47:43,250
What do the doctors say?

643
00:47:43,458 --> 00:47:46,917
You know, with the recent progress,
they're gonna keep me alive until 70.

644
00:47:47,208 --> 00:47:49,625
With massages and medication.

645
00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:54,208
It's expensive...
but I'm a rich quadriplegic.

646
00:47:56,083 --> 00:47:58,075
I would shoot myself.

647
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:01,083
Well, you can't even do that
when you're tetraplegic.

648
00:48:01,417 --> 00:48:03,208
Oh shit. That's right.

649
00:48:03,917 --> 00:48:06,458
That's tough, man.

650
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:09,000
What day are we today?

651
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:10,625
I don't know, the
8th or the 9th...

652
00:48:10,917 --> 00:48:12,792
So it's official!

653
00:48:12,958 --> 00:48:15,708
- What?
- You did it.

654
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Your trial is over.

655
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:21,250
- So I'm hired?
- Of course you're hired.

656
00:48:21,375 --> 00:48:24,042
- Can I count on you?
- Yeah.

657
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:25,125
Good.

658
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:29,333
Then give me the "Fabergé" egg back.

659
00:48:30,083 --> 00:48:31,542
It's a gift from Alice.

660
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:35,958
She got me one each year we were together.
I have 25 of them.

661
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,500
They're really important to me.

662
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:40,292
I don't know. Why do you say...

663
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,792
I didn't do it.

664
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
What is it you lost?

665
00:48:58,208 --> 00:49:00,542
Mina! Mina!

666
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:06,958
- What are you doing here?
- Hurry up, get in the car.

667
00:49:07,917 --> 00:49:09,917
Put your seat-belt on.

668
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:21,833
How are you?

669
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:30,708
How is school?

670
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:33,875
Why don't you answer my texts?

671
00:49:35,167 --> 00:49:37,042
I was busy.

672
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:42,500
So tell me, who did you
talk to on the phone?

673
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:44,667
A cop, he wanted to talk to mom.

674
00:49:44,792 --> 00:49:48,500
I faked her voice and told him
someone was going to pick him up.

675
00:49:50,083 --> 00:49:52,958
Did you find my egg?

676
00:49:55,042 --> 00:49:56,500
Did you find it or not?

677
00:49:57,083 --> 00:50:00,500
I don't care about your stupid egg.
I didn't find it anyway.

678
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:10,542
What did you tell them?

679
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:12,250
Nothing.
I had nothing to tell them.

680
00:50:12,458 --> 00:50:15,067
I only had 30 grams, you know the law.
They couldn't do anything.

681
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:18,125
They kept me in custody and
eventually had to let me go.

682
00:50:18,292 --> 00:50:20,625
Do you want to have a sandwich?

683
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:23,333
- I'm not getting in this car.
- Get in.

684
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:25,292
- Let me go!
- Hands off! Who's taking you home?

685
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,333
Who's taking you home?

686
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:30,625
- Get lost.
- It's none of your business.

687
00:50:30,875 --> 00:50:32,792
Get lost!

688
00:50:44,545 --> 00:50:46,045
Fuck.

689
00:50:46,417 --> 00:50:49,917
Her polished eyes are carved
in delicate minerals,

690
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:53,542
And in this strange and
symbolic nature...

691
00:50:53,875 --> 00:50:56,125
"And in this strange..."

692
00:50:57,042 --> 00:50:58,708
"...and symbolic..."

693
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:02,083
- "...nature"
- How boring is that?

694
00:51:04,167 --> 00:51:07,750
'Where the pure angel merges
with the antic Sphinx"

695
00:51:08,083 --> 00:51:10,000
I never know if "Sphinx"
takes a 'i' or a 'y'?

696
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:13,500
I'm so bored by all this.

697
00:51:13,958 --> 00:51:15,917
It's a "I" and it's singular.

698
00:51:16,125 --> 00:51:18,833
Do you really have to go
through this bullshit?

699
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
A sphinx, daisies, angels...

700
00:51:21,625 --> 00:51:24,500
Would you care for a
guy telling you this?

701
00:51:24,917 --> 00:51:27,667
Of course, some use a more basic method.

702
00:51:28,958 --> 00:51:30,917
What's next?

703
00:51:31,125 --> 00:51:32,917
What does this Eléonore look like?

704
00:51:33,125 --> 00:51:36,000
I don't know, I don't care.

705
00:51:36,292 --> 00:51:39,167
It's intellectual. Emotional.

706
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:42,250
Before focusing on the physical
I seek a mind to mind relationship.

707
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,250
Intellectual fine.
But what if she looks like a dog?

708
00:51:44,542 --> 00:51:47,125
You'd be having an intellectual
"mind to dog" relationship.

709
00:51:47,292 --> 00:51:48,417
Very elegant.

710
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:49,917
Really.

711
00:51:51,042 --> 00:51:52,750
Nothing to add.

712
00:51:53,083 --> 00:51:54,208
Bravo.

713
00:51:54,375 --> 00:51:57,083
How long has it been going on?

714
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,958
He's such a pain in the ass.

715
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,667
Six months.

716
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,208
Six months?

717
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:10,125
And you've never seen her?

718
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,500
She really might be ugly.
Or fat.

719
00:52:12,708 --> 00:52:14,042
Or even disabled.

720
00:52:14,208 --> 00:52:17,250
You should add that after the poem:
"By the way, how much do you weigh?"

721
00:52:17,542 --> 00:52:18,208
Write it.

722
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:21,750
Thanks a lot for your
useful advice, Driss.

723
00:52:22,083 --> 00:52:23,875
Let's get back to it.

724
00:52:24,083 --> 00:52:25,583
Where was I?

725
00:52:26,708 --> 00:52:32,042
I think a sphinx was eating daisies,
running in the fields, doing weird stuff.

726
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:33,375
Let's see...

727
00:52:34,125 --> 00:52:36,750
"And in this strange and symbolic nature"

728
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,625
And in this strange and symbolic nature...

729
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:42,000
You have to call her.

730
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:46,375
Where the pure angel merges
with the antic sphinx...

731
00:52:46,583 --> 00:52:48,333
I'm telling you. Call her.

732
00:52:48,542 --> 00:52:52,875
Listen, Driss.
I'm better at written communication.

733
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:54,333
Unbelievable.

734
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,708
Fine, but I'm gonna look for her phone
number because this is stressing me out.

735
00:52:59,125 --> 00:53:00,083
Hey!

736
00:53:01,958 --> 00:53:03,667
She's from Dunkerque...
that's not good.

737
00:53:03,917 --> 00:53:05,417
Leave this envelope!

738
00:53:05,667 --> 00:53:08,750
Never has a "Miss France" come from the north.
They usually look like crap over there.

739
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,625
Give it back immediately.

740
00:53:10,833 --> 00:53:14,292
She wrote her phone number, goddamn it.
It's a sign. She wants you to call her!

741
00:53:14,583 --> 00:53:16,583
Please. Let it go.

742
00:53:16,792 --> 00:53:20,292
She wrote her phone number, Philippe.
What do you think? It means "Call Me".

743
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,667
"I want to lick your ear lobe."

744
00:53:22,875 --> 00:53:24,458
- Of course, Philippe.
- You're not calling her, are you?

745
00:53:24,708 --> 00:53:27,375
She doesn't give a shit about poetry.
Six fucking months of poetry...

746
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:28,917
He's bonkers.

747
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:32,458
- I won't talk to her.
- I'm gonna check if she has a weird accent.

748
00:53:32,625 --> 00:53:33,750
Northern accent sucks..

749
00:53:34,125 --> 00:53:35,458
Put down the phone!

750
00:53:35,625 --> 00:53:38,917
She wants a piece of Philippe.
She's gonna have some.

751
00:53:39,125 --> 00:53:39,958
Hello.

752
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,125
Nice voice, for a start.

753
00:53:43,042 --> 00:53:44,000
Hello...

754
00:53:44,167 --> 00:53:45,333
No.

755
00:53:46,083 --> 00:53:46,917
No.

756
00:53:47,125 --> 00:53:49,875
- Hello...
- Improvise! Talk about daisies and shit...

757
00:53:50,125 --> 00:53:51,208
Eléonore?

758
00:53:51,417 --> 00:53:52,542
It's Philippe.

759
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:54,667
Well I...

760
00:53:54,875 --> 00:53:58,250
I'm calling you because I really
wanted to hear your voice.

761
00:53:58,417 --> 00:54:02,458
And so far, your "Hello"
already fills me with joy.

762
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:05,167
Hold on. I'm gonna get her.

763
00:54:05,958 --> 00:54:08,917
Stop with your complicated sentences.

764
00:54:09,167 --> 00:54:12,083
- Hello.
- Eléonore? It's Philippe.

765
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,458
Philippe?

766
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:16,833
Well, I was writing you a letter
and...

767
00:54:17,167 --> 00:54:20,833
And I thought, why not simply call her.

768
00:54:21,042 --> 00:54:23,333
Don't forget to ask about her weight.

769
00:54:23,542 --> 00:54:25,833
- Pardon me?
- Nothing.

770
00:54:26,292 --> 00:54:27,167
I'm grieving.

771
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:28,917
I want to cry.

772
00:54:29,208 --> 00:54:31,292
I'm afraid.
Lord give me peace...

773
00:54:31,542 --> 00:54:33,000
Exactly, that's it!

774
00:54:33,292 --> 00:54:34,583
I can't corner you.

775
00:54:34,875 --> 00:54:37,000
- How great that you love "Rimbaud".
- Sorry.

776
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:38,708
- I was first in line. Thank you.
- Eléonore.

777
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:40,875
I'm glad.

778
00:54:41,125 --> 00:54:42,650
Yes, I am.

779
00:54:42,717 --> 00:54:46,758
- What a big mouth... he can't be stopped.
- I'm sending you kisses.

780
00:54:47,583 --> 00:54:50,167
Everyone kisses,
licking ears and all.

781
00:54:50,417 --> 00:54:53,333
Good. So what's up?

782
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:56,792
There's good news
and less good news.

783
00:54:57,125 --> 00:54:59,542
- What about the good part?
- 116 lbs.

784
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:01,000
- 116 lbs? That's really good.

785
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:04,333
Unless she's three feet tall.

786
00:55:04,833 --> 00:55:06,417
On the other hand...

787
00:55:06,708 --> 00:55:08,000
she wants a picture.

788
00:55:08,417 --> 00:55:10,750
- So?
- Come on.

789
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,208
Good evening.
Can I see your tickets?

790
00:55:13,417 --> 00:55:15,500
- Good evening.
- It's over here.

791
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:17,250
- Perfect.
- Have a good night.

792
00:55:17,458 --> 00:55:19,917
- Good night to you.
- We'll be just here if you're looking for us...

793
00:55:20,125 --> 00:55:22,917
We won't be moving.
Especially him.

794
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:27,208
Wait...
What do you think women want?

795
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:28,417
I don't know.

796
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:31,500
A cute, charming, elegant man...

797
00:55:31,708 --> 00:55:35,417
No kidding. They want money.
Security.

798
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,583
Ask him.

799
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:42,083
And you have all that.

800
00:55:42,583 --> 00:55:48,417
I might be naive, but I still hope I have
something more than my bank account..

801
00:55:48,708 --> 00:55:52,875
She spent 6 months reading your goddamn poems.
And she likes it.

802
00:55:53,125 --> 00:55:54,917
She's weird, don't worry.

803
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:57,458
I'm sure she doesn't give
a damn about the wheelchair.

804
00:55:57,625 --> 00:55:58,667
That's true.

805
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:02,458
Plus guys from the north drink so much
they're all beating their ladies.

806
00:56:02,583 --> 00:56:03,750
She'll see there's no risk with you.

807
00:56:03,917 --> 00:56:05,375
Jerk.

808
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:09,375
That's pragmatic though, right?

809
00:56:10,625 --> 00:56:12,083
Yeah, whatever.

810
00:56:12,333 --> 00:56:13,583
The photo is a good test.

811
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:16,708
If she sends hers back,
she's ready to go further.

812
00:56:17,042 --> 00:56:20,125
You can send a picture of you with
the chair, but not too obvious.

813
00:56:20,417 --> 00:56:22,750
You don't have to send a
Telethon-like picture...

814
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,125
Drooling and all...

815
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,375
Looking like shit.

816
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:29,500
Alright, alright.

817
00:56:42,667 --> 00:56:44,042
He has a problem.

818
00:56:44,208 --> 00:56:46,083
A big one.

819
00:56:46,417 --> 00:56:48,125
Shush yourself.

820
00:56:51,458 --> 00:56:53,625
He's a tree...

821
00:56:53,875 --> 00:56:55,667
A singing tree.

822
00:57:02,125 --> 00:57:04,500
In german?

823
00:57:04,708 --> 00:57:06,167
Stop shushing me!

824
00:57:06,458 --> 00:57:08,500
It's in german anyway.

825
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:10,750
As if it wasn't enough.

826
00:57:11,042 --> 00:57:12,667
You're crazy.

827
00:57:12,958 --> 00:57:14,375
Oh man.

828
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,292
- How long does it last?
- Four hours.

829
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:17,750
Fuck.

830
00:57:21,792 --> 00:57:24,375
You looked damn fine in the old times.

831
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:26,750
Which one?

832
00:57:28,958 --> 00:57:30,417
This one.

833
00:57:34,167 --> 00:57:36,500
There's also this one...
I like it a lot.

834
00:57:36,708 --> 00:57:38,333
The chair is not obvious.

835
00:57:38,583 --> 00:57:42,375
But you can see something is going
on, and you look really good.

836
00:57:42,875 --> 00:57:45,292
- Are we doing this?
- I don't know.

837
00:57:45,875 --> 00:57:47,500
Didn't you have a blast on the phone?

838
00:57:47,708 --> 00:57:48,542
I did.

839
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:49,833
Is that all?

840
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,375
- I had a fucking blast.
- So?

841
00:57:52,708 --> 00:57:55,083
So we're sending this goddamn picture.

842
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:59,458
That's what I'm talking about.
Let's do it!

843
00:58:03,417 --> 00:58:05,083
Give me a cigarette.

844
00:58:05,292 --> 00:58:07,292
Don't you ever knock?

845
00:58:07,458 --> 00:58:08,667
Are you painting?

846
00:58:08,833 --> 00:58:10,583
- Yes, get out!
- You're kidding me.

847
00:58:10,833 --> 00:58:13,292
Ha, ha, painting.
Did you learn how to read as well?

848
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,292
I told you to get out of here!

849
00:58:15,542 --> 00:58:18,708
Or what? You'll beat me?
Is that how women are treated in your country?

850
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,542
You're out of your mind.
Get out!

851
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:23,708
- I'll leave if and when I want.
- Right!

852
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:27,208
- See, I'm deciding to leave now.
- Beat it!

853
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:28,417
God damn it.

854
00:58:28,542 --> 00:58:32,083
Replace this picture with the other one.

855
00:58:33,083 --> 00:58:36,250
Please post it yourself,
and be discreet.

856
00:58:36,542 --> 00:58:38,000
As you want.

857
00:58:39,042 --> 00:58:41,833
Now throw the other
picture in the trash.

858
00:58:42,125 --> 00:58:43,417
I'm loosing it.

859
00:58:43,667 --> 00:58:45,292
"HOOKERS"

860
00:58:48,583 --> 00:58:51,208
- What's wrong?
- Your daughter is.

861
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,250
- I was painting...
- You were... painting?

862
00:58:54,375 --> 00:58:56,850
Yes, whatever.
I wanted to tell you...

863
00:58:56,958 --> 00:58:59,292
She needs to cool it...
otherwise I will nail her to the wall!

864
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:02,083
- Alright, cool it a little.
- No, I'm not cooling anything!

865
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:04,417
Am I not your arms and your legs?

866
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:05,125
Yes.

867
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:09,167
Well I want to be your hands too.
So she can get what she deserves.

868
00:59:09,417 --> 00:59:11,750
Since you can't really do anything
besides driving your chair over her.

869
00:59:11,958 --> 00:59:15,167
Driss, don't you think
you're overreacting. Yvonne?

870
00:59:15,833 --> 00:59:17,000
Yvonne...

871
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:19,458
Well...

872
00:59:20,458 --> 00:59:23,208
She might need a light admonition.

873
00:59:23,417 --> 00:59:24,167
A light one?

874
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,708
She's 16, dressing and painting
her face outrageously.

875
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,375
She's also making out with that
feather duster all over the house.

876
00:59:29,625 --> 00:59:32,708
But that's none of my business.
It's her education.

877
00:59:32,917 --> 00:59:35,333
What I have a problem with is
how she looks down on everyone.

878
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:39,083
How she talks to me. To you!
No respect!

879
00:59:39,292 --> 00:59:41,583
What are we? Slaves?

880
00:59:41,792 --> 00:59:44,292
So give me the go and
I'll give her a lesson right now.

881
00:59:44,583 --> 00:59:48,625
Alright, I get it.
Let me take care of it.

882
00:59:50,667 --> 00:59:52,625
Then take care of it. Fast.

883
00:59:53,208 --> 00:59:55,542
I'm gonna break something...

884
00:59:56,875 --> 00:59:59,167
He's painting?
What is he painting?

885
00:59:59,333 --> 01:00:00,875
I have no idea.

886
01:00:21,542 --> 01:00:23,067
Get up, Philippe.

887
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:25,010
On your feet!

888
01:00:29,610 --> 01:00:31,610
Power hose, here we come!

889
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:03,042
Fits you like a charm.

890
01:01:03,375 --> 01:01:05,708
Right.

891
01:01:15,708 --> 01:01:20,792
You don't respect the people working for me.
It's unacceptable. Do you understand?

892
01:01:21,375 --> 01:01:22,917
I think she doesn't. Toughen up.

893
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:25,875
By the way I don't want to see
this sort of feather duster here any more.

894
01:01:26,125 --> 01:01:27,958
- I get it! Leave me alone.
- I won't leave you alone.

895
01:01:28,167 --> 01:01:31,833
Do I need to drive my chair
over you to make you obey me?

896
01:01:32,042 --> 01:01:34,500
That's it. We're getting there.

897
01:01:38,042 --> 01:01:40,458
- You did that?
- Yeah.

898
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:42,750
I love it.

899
01:01:43,375 --> 01:01:47,442
I'm not saying I would
hang it at my place...

900
01:01:47,542 --> 01:01:48,900
but it's...

901
01:01:49,958 --> 01:01:52,750
How much do you think
we'll get from it?

902
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:55,250
We'll see.

903
01:01:55,833 --> 01:01:58,875
We'll see more or less?

904
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:00,250
It's...

905
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,083
- What the hell?
- What?

906
01:02:03,417 --> 01:02:05,792
- No tongue. I promise.
- You're retarded.

907
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,708
Can't you go faster?
I can't run in these conditions.

908
01:02:11,167 --> 01:02:15,125
- I'm at the maximum.
- The maximum... it's way too slow.

909
01:02:16,042 --> 01:02:17,917
Nine miles per hour. Suits him?

910
01:02:19,875 --> 01:02:21,208
Is 9 miles per hour ok?

911
01:02:21,333 --> 01:02:23,499
Is that the best he can do?
Can't we get more?

912
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:26,417
- It's the maximum.
- It'll do.

913
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,250
Oh yeah...

914
01:02:57,417 --> 01:02:58,542
No, no.

915
01:02:58,833 --> 01:03:00,750
Stick to the ears.

916
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:02,292
There.

917
01:03:19,667 --> 01:03:21,042
- Bye.
- Bye.

918
01:03:21,375 --> 01:03:22,625
Hi, Yvonne.

919
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:25,667
No, he can't hear me. He's too far.

920
01:03:25,875 --> 01:03:27,708
He can't hear us, Yvonne.

921
01:03:28,042 --> 01:03:29,125
Ok.

922
01:03:29,583 --> 01:03:31,833
We'll be home at 8:30 sharp.

923
01:03:32,125 --> 01:03:35,167
Yes, we'll be on time.
Bye, Yvonne.

924
01:03:35,875 --> 01:03:37,350
- What's up? She's freaking out?
- Yeah.

925
01:03:37,458 --> 01:03:39,333
It's your surprise birthday again.

926
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:41,292
It's half an hour earlier.

927
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,583
She's all stressed out every year.

928
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,833
She's inviting all my family,
every year it's exactly the same deal.

929
01:03:49,208 --> 01:03:52,792
They're mostly coming to see
if I'm still alive.

930
01:03:53,042 --> 01:03:55,500
Just checking...

931
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,208
And I pretend to be surprised.

932
01:03:59,458 --> 01:04:01,208
Everyone's doing their best.

933
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:05,375
But in the end looks like
we're all pretty much bored.

934
01:04:43,417 --> 01:04:44,583
Sorry.

935
01:04:45,125 --> 01:04:46,333
Excuse me.

936
01:04:46,708 --> 01:04:47,750
Sorry.

937
01:04:48,125 --> 01:04:49,500
Sorry.

938
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:51,500
Excuse me.

939
01:04:51,833 --> 01:04:54,167
Would you mind changing seats?
I called this one.

940
01:04:54,333 --> 01:04:56,167
I would mind indeed.

941
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,333
C'mon, c'mon. Thanks.

942
01:04:58,542 --> 01:05:02,083
Quickly. Scoot over!

943
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:03,667
There.

944
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:05,667
Very nice of you.

945
01:05:17,333 --> 01:05:19,500
The suit makes you
look like another man.

946
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:22,458
It looks good on you.

947
01:05:23,708 --> 01:05:26,500
You look like Barack Obama.

948
01:05:26,625 --> 01:05:27,792
Really?

949
01:05:30,833 --> 01:05:32,083
She has the hots for me.

950
01:05:32,667 --> 01:05:36,083
Barack Obama. How cool is that?

951
01:05:38,917 --> 01:05:42,375
It's a bit like someone called you...
Mitt Romney for instance.

952
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,083
Raffarin.

953
01:05:44,875 --> 01:05:47,000
Or George Bush.

954
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:58,125
What are you doing?
You're gonna miss the concert.

955
01:05:58,333 --> 01:06:00,000
Leave me alone.

956
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:03,375
- Are you menstruating or what?
- Get out.

957
01:06:03,667 --> 01:06:04,833
What's up?

958
01:06:06,125 --> 01:06:07,250
Elisa.

959
01:06:07,375 --> 01:06:08,625
Elisa.

960
01:06:08,917 --> 01:06:11,208
- Leave me alone, goddammit.
- What did you take?

961
01:06:12,417 --> 01:06:13,833
What did you do?

962
01:06:16,958 --> 01:06:19,667
- Where did you find this?
- In Yvonne's purse.

963
01:06:19,917 --> 01:06:21,042
Imodium?

964
01:06:21,292 --> 01:06:23,125
What was your plan?

965
01:06:23,458 --> 01:06:25,250
Suicide?

966
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:29,958
- You're just gonna stop pooping for 3 months.
- Leave me alone!

967
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,208
Wait... You took paracetamol too?

968
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:34,667
You're gonna die! It's dangerous!

969
01:06:36,667 --> 01:06:39,167
What should we do? Call 911?

970
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:40,875
Why would you do that?

971
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,375
It's Bastien.

972
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:45,417
- What about him?
- He dumped me.

973
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:49,208
He doesn't care about me.
He called me a slut.

974
01:06:49,625 --> 01:06:50,708
Not cool.

975
01:06:51,042 --> 01:06:53,458
Nobody would care if I died anyway.

976
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:55,667
Bullshit! Stop saying that.
Let's join the party.

977
01:06:55,792 --> 01:06:56,908
Can't you go see him?

978
01:06:57,458 --> 01:06:58,792
Talk to him?

979
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,833
- To who?
- Bastien. I'll pay you.

980
01:07:02,125 --> 01:07:04,167
What do you mean you'll pay me?
You've really lost it!

981
01:07:04,417 --> 01:07:06,667
Do you think I have time to deal
with children's' heartaches?

982
01:07:06,792 --> 01:07:08,875
- Please.
- Talk to Bastien?

983
01:07:09,042 --> 01:07:10,292
Paying me?

984
01:07:11,417 --> 01:07:13,875
Who do you think you're talking to?

985
01:07:14,708 --> 01:07:16,792
Please, Driss.

986
01:07:17,208 --> 01:07:19,875
How much?

987
01:07:20,625 --> 01:07:22,042
You're silly.

988
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:28,250
Well, there's something.
There's a particular touch to it.

989
01:07:28,625 --> 01:07:33,792
But I mean... 11.000 € for an
unknown artist seems like a lot.

990
01:07:33,917 --> 01:07:35,417
Hmm...

991
01:07:36,083 --> 01:07:40,542
On the other hand, if I don't buy it
it's going to be worth the triple in a year...

992
01:07:40,833 --> 01:07:42,667
And you'll tell me: "I told you".

993
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:43,833
Am I right?

994
01:07:44,083 --> 01:07:45,042
Hmm.

995
01:07:45,542 --> 01:07:49,292
- You told me he has a gallery in London?
- And Berlin soon.

996
01:07:49,542 --> 01:07:50,875
Berlin?

997
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,417
Well that's...

998
01:07:54,083 --> 01:07:56,375
I don't know...

999
01:07:57,375 --> 01:08:00,792
11.000 € is a lot.

1000
01:08:01,042 --> 01:08:05,292
Come on, give me something.
Does she have someone?

1001
01:08:05,583 --> 01:08:07,125
Yes. Fred.

1002
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:08,917
What about Fred?

1003
01:08:09,167 --> 01:08:11,000
They've been together for two years.

1004
01:08:11,917 --> 01:08:15,833
But it's an on and off thing...
There's a lot of tension.

1005
01:08:16,042 --> 01:08:19,292
Right now...
I know it's not going that well.

1006
01:08:19,875 --> 01:08:21,583
- Maybe because of me.
- Yup.

1007
01:08:21,875 --> 01:08:24,208
- Did she say something about me?
- No.

1008
01:08:24,708 --> 01:08:25,708
Alright, of course she did.

1009
01:08:26,208 --> 01:08:27,250
A little bit.

1010
01:08:27,542 --> 01:08:31,458
Yes! I knew it!
She's got the hots for me.

1011
01:08:33,083 --> 01:08:34,208
What, you're spoofing me?

1012
01:08:34,375 --> 01:08:36,583
- No.
- Laugh as much as you want.

1013
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:38,667
One day Magali will be in my bed.

1014
01:08:38,917 --> 01:08:41,208
Hope well and have well.

1015
01:08:41,792 --> 01:08:45,000
Careful with the appetisers,
given your stomach issues...

1016
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:50,583
I'm not a doctor, but I know if you
take Imodium, something's wrong.

1017
01:08:59,625 --> 01:09:01,500
Pardon me. Please...

1018
01:09:01,833 --> 01:09:03,625
Can I ask you a favour?

1019
01:09:03,875 --> 01:09:05,792
A little piece for me?

1020
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:08,292
No, Philippe! We were chilling.

1021
01:09:08,625 --> 01:09:09,750
Yes.

1022
01:09:10,792 --> 01:09:13,667
Vivaldi, the Fours Seasons.
Summer?

1023
01:09:14,292 --> 01:09:17,500
You'll see, you'll like it.

1024
01:09:32,833 --> 01:09:35,667
What about that?
Don't tell me you don't feel anything.

1025
01:09:35,917 --> 01:09:37,083
Nope. Nothing.

1026
01:09:38,083 --> 01:09:39,458
Not at all.

1027
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:42,500
For me, it's not music
if you can't dance to it.

1028
01:09:42,583 --> 01:09:44,508
Let's try something else.

1029
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:52,250
Yeah. I know this one.

1030
01:09:52,625 --> 01:09:54,583
It's a commercial!

1031
01:09:55,167 --> 01:09:56,667
For coffee, right?

1032
01:10:01,458 --> 01:10:03,833
I shall leave thee now.

1033
01:10:04,125 --> 01:10:06,417
I am expected by the
king at the castle.

1034
01:10:06,833 --> 01:10:09,083
I'm taking the minstrels there.

1035
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:10,417
Let's go.

1036
01:10:11,167 --> 01:10:13,792
I'm a brave and good knight.

1037
01:10:14,292 --> 01:10:16,125
Wow, that's creepy...

1038
01:10:16,375 --> 01:10:19,375
It's about naked people...

1039
01:10:20,375 --> 01:10:24,042
They're running naked in the fields.

1040
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:26,000
And giggling...

1041
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:27,833
Alright, alright...

1042
01:10:28,042 --> 01:10:29,875
Bach was badass.

1043
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:32,042
I'm sure he got all the
chicks with his music.

1044
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:35,167
It's the 18th century's Barry White.

1045
01:10:35,833 --> 01:10:36,875
Oh. I know this one.

1046
01:10:37,417 --> 01:10:39,625
Everyone knows it.

1047
01:10:39,833 --> 01:10:41,250
Of course.

1048
01:10:41,583 --> 01:10:44,292
"You have reached the Paris
Social Welfare Agency."

1049
01:10:44,542 --> 01:10:46,792
"All our lines are currently busy."

1050
01:10:46,958 --> 01:10:49,917
"The estimated waiting
time is: two years."

1051
01:10:57,208 --> 01:11:00,042
Isn't it Tom and Jerry?

1052
01:11:06,458 --> 01:11:08,167
Tom and Jerry...

1053
01:11:08,375 --> 01:11:09,875
What a jerk.

1054
01:11:10,083 --> 01:11:11,208
Help!

1055
01:11:11,417 --> 01:11:12,625
Rescue the masterpieces!

1056
01:11:14,417 --> 01:11:17,917
Now it's my turn. We listened to
your classics, let's listen to mine.

1057
01:11:18,083 --> 01:11:21,750
"Earth, Wind & Fire".
I told you about them. So good!

1058
01:11:25,375 --> 01:11:26,458
It's something else.

1059
01:11:26,667 --> 01:11:28,208
That's something else for sure.

1060
01:11:28,458 --> 01:11:29,750
Am I right?
I'm here for nobody!

1061
01:11:32,083 --> 01:11:33,208
Driss.

1062
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,875
- Driss.
- I can't hear you.

1063
01:12:10,167 --> 01:12:11,983
Come on, it's a birthday.
Let's dance!

1064
01:12:12,125 --> 01:12:15,500
Come on. For Philippe.

1065
01:13:00,833 --> 01:13:01,958
There.

1066
01:13:07,667 --> 01:13:08,833
So...

1067
01:13:10,208 --> 01:13:12,500
With all that, I didn't
give you my little present.

1068
01:13:12,708 --> 01:13:14,000
It arrived this morning, but...

1069
01:13:14,333 --> 01:13:17,042
I didn't want to ruin the party,
in case she was ugly or something.

1070
01:13:17,292 --> 01:13:20,250
You never know.
But at least she replied.

1071
01:13:20,542 --> 01:13:22,833
Well... Good night!

1072
01:13:23,875 --> 01:13:27,208
Alright, I'll open it because
knowing you, it's gonna take ages...

1073
01:13:29,583 --> 01:13:30,792
So?

1074
01:13:32,667 --> 01:13:35,375
She does not look like a dog.
Not at all.

1075
01:13:35,708 --> 01:13:37,583
Oh damn...

1076
01:13:37,792 --> 01:13:40,583
It must be the only northern girl
with all her teeth.

1077
01:13:40,792 --> 01:13:41,875
There's a note with it.

1078
01:13:42,083 --> 01:13:48,042
"I'll be in Paris next week.
I'm waiting for your call." "Dot dot dot."

1079
01:13:48,875 --> 01:13:50,333
You know what "Dot dot dot" means, right?

1080
01:13:50,542 --> 01:13:52,500
What does it mean?

1081
01:13:52,667 --> 01:13:55,375
- That's good?
- Of course it's good, she wants you.

1082
01:13:55,542 --> 01:13:59,517
One dot, two dots, three dots,
she wants you, end of the story.

1083
01:14:00,167 --> 01:14:02,333
I'm gonna score...

1084
01:14:02,417 --> 01:14:03,933
Feels good, doesn't it?

1085
01:14:04,167 --> 01:14:06,958
- I'm too excited to sleep.
- But you will.

1086
01:14:07,833 --> 01:14:09,417
I'm putting the picture here.

1087
01:14:10,333 --> 01:14:12,042
She's watching you sleep.

1088
01:14:12,583 --> 01:14:13,458
There.

1089
01:14:13,833 --> 01:14:15,708
Good night, Philippe.

1090
01:14:15,958 --> 01:14:18,625
Sweet dreams.

1091
01:14:29,625 --> 01:14:32,583
Let's try the hat again.

1092
01:14:34,083 --> 01:14:36,125
- Not bad.
- No.

1093
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:38,417
No. He looks like a chimney sweeper.

1094
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:40,058
He can't be dressed too classic.

1095
01:14:40,167 --> 01:14:42,375
- What did I just say?
- Ok, so it's too classic.

1096
01:14:42,542 --> 01:14:46,583
Forget the hat.

1097
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:49,625
Regular or fancy?

1098
01:14:49,917 --> 01:14:51,333
There's something.

1099
01:14:51,667 --> 01:14:53,000
It works.

1100
01:14:53,208 --> 01:14:55,083
- Feeling good?
- Jerk.

1101
01:14:55,667 --> 01:14:57,917
- Let's ride to Dunkerque...
- Come on.

1102
01:14:58,208 --> 01:15:01,083
Yvonne will take me there.
I'll go alone.

1103
01:15:01,333 --> 01:15:03,917
- Really?
- It's fine.

1104
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:06,625
Yes. I'll manage.

1105
01:15:06,917 --> 01:15:08,750
Alright.

1106
01:15:12,583 --> 01:15:14,333
I think I'm freaking out a little.

1107
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:17,667
Don't worry, it doesn't show.

1108
01:15:19,625 --> 01:15:21,667
4... a... c - b square

1109
01:15:21,958 --> 01:15:23,000
- b square?

1110
01:15:23,167 --> 01:15:25,292
I found 20, not b squ...

1111
01:15:25,458 --> 01:15:26,292
Hey.

1112
01:15:26,958 --> 01:15:29,333
Go take a walk, blondie.

1113
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,750
- So Bastien... You remember me?
- Yeah.

1114
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
- Oh yeah?
- What's wrong?

1115
01:15:33,167 --> 01:15:35,333
I heard what you told Elisa.
It's not very nice.

1116
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:36,833
- I didn't say anything...
- Shut up.

1117
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,333
Now you'll act like a man and apologise.

1118
01:15:39,542 --> 01:15:41,750
- I'm sorry, man.
- Hands off me.

1119
01:15:42,042 --> 01:15:44,167
- Not to me, to her!
- Ok, to her.

1120
01:15:44,375 --> 01:15:46,667
And you'll bring her
croissants every morning.

1121
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:48,292
- Plain or with butter?
- What?

1122
01:15:48,458 --> 01:15:51,125
- Plain or with butter?
- Whatever. I don't care.

1123
01:15:51,292 --> 01:15:52,750
Do as you want, but do it right.

1124
01:15:52,958 --> 01:15:54,750
- You be nice.
- Yes. I'll be very nice.

1125
01:15:54,958 --> 01:15:56,917
Now move. Move!

1126
01:15:57,542 --> 01:15:59,533
And take care of your hair.
Put a hair clip or something.

1127
01:16:03,042 --> 01:16:04,583
What time is it?

1128
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:07,417
4:45

1129
01:16:15,167 --> 01:16:17,667
Should I loose the hat?

1130
01:16:18,458 --> 01:16:20,500
Yeah. That's better.

1131
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:30,167
What time is it?

1132
01:16:30,375 --> 01:16:34,000
46 - 47.
It's not changing that fast.

1133
01:16:34,917 --> 01:16:36,750
I'd like a whisky.

1134
01:16:37,167 --> 01:16:38,208
Yeah.

1135
01:16:41,583 --> 01:16:43,042
Please?

1136
01:17:16,667 --> 01:17:17,667
One more.

1137
01:17:18,167 --> 01:17:19,875
I don't think this is a good idea...

1138
01:17:20,125 --> 01:17:21,583
Make it a double.

1139
01:17:23,917 --> 01:17:27,083
Sir, a double whisky please.

1140
01:17:56,917 --> 01:17:58,625
- Hello.
- Hello, Driss.

1141
01:17:58,917 --> 01:18:00,583
What are you doing now?
Are you busy?

1142
01:18:00,792 --> 01:18:02,750
I'm working out. How's it going?

1143
01:18:02,958 --> 01:18:05,333
Don't you want to get away?

1144
01:18:05,833 --> 01:18:07,458
No questions?

1145
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:08,958
No. No questions.

1146
01:18:09,167 --> 01:18:11,792
- You want to leave?
- Yes.

1147
01:18:12,958 --> 01:18:14,083
Where are we going?

1148
01:18:14,917 --> 01:18:16,792
Get some fresh air.

1149
01:18:17,208 --> 01:18:19,167
Get some fresh air.

1150
01:18:20,333 --> 01:18:22,583
A shower and I'll be there.

1151
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:26,417
We're going. Take the hat.

1152
01:18:26,667 --> 01:18:29,792
- But it's barely 6.
- We're going.

1153
01:19:06,625 --> 01:19:08,833
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1154
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:18,708
Give him some champagne too.
It'll help him relax.

1155
01:19:18,875 --> 01:19:20,033
I'm not stressed out.

1156
01:19:20,150 --> 01:19:21,833
- Really?
- No.

1157
01:19:39,208 --> 01:19:40,708
It's only us?

1158
01:19:41,875 --> 01:19:45,292
The other people didn't come?
It's just us.

1159
01:20:04,667 --> 01:20:06,750
Ok, I'm a little nervous.

1160
01:20:07,042 --> 01:20:08,250
Why?

1161
01:20:08,917 --> 01:20:10,375
I don't know.

1162
01:20:11,583 --> 01:20:14,125
We both know you're not
the luckiest person.

1163
01:20:14,417 --> 01:20:15,750
The accident...

1164
01:20:15,875 --> 01:20:18,000
The chair... Your wife.

1165
01:20:18,375 --> 01:20:21,292
It's Kennedy-like scary.

1166
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:24,250
- Miss?
- Yes?

1167
01:20:24,458 --> 01:20:27,042
Can you give him the package?

1168
01:20:27,375 --> 01:20:28,792
Thank you.

1169
01:20:33,083 --> 01:20:34,583
Thank you.

1170
01:20:35,333 --> 01:20:36,750
Why?

1171
01:20:45,167 --> 01:20:46,250
What's that?

1172
01:20:46,417 --> 01:20:50,792
That's what you're worth in the art business.
I got 11.000 € for your painting.

1173
01:20:51,042 --> 01:20:54,000
- You shouldn't stop, you have a hell of a talent.
- Yup.

1174
01:20:54,167 --> 01:20:56,542
That's a good deal. I knew it.

1175
01:20:56,667 --> 01:20:59,292
I felt it. It was instinct.

1176
01:20:59,583 --> 01:21:03,500
With the music and all...
It all blended...

1177
01:21:03,792 --> 01:21:07,542
And then, an epiphany!
I saw a light.

1178
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:09,125
Stay humble will you?

1179
01:21:09,292 --> 01:21:11,750
11.000 €, though, can you believe it?

1180
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:14,458
What was that?

1181
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:18,083
Nothing. Just a hole in the cabin.

1182
01:21:18,417 --> 01:21:20,875
Philippe, tell me if something's wrong.

1183
01:21:21,208 --> 01:21:22,542
It was very nice knowing you.

1184
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:24,917
I don't like these jokes.
Really.

1185
01:21:25,167 --> 01:21:29,167
You're used to drama, but I'm not.

1186
01:22:00,583 --> 01:22:02,750
You have to be really insane to do that.

1187
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,167
A little bit.

1188
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,083
I'll tell you something, Philippe.

1189
01:22:12,333 --> 01:22:16,792
- You're a serious maniac.
- Really? I didn't know that.

1190
01:22:18,375 --> 01:22:21,542
- Now you get Driss ready.
- Sure.

1191
01:22:21,833 --> 01:22:24,250
Right. In your dreams.
I'm not doing any of this.

1192
01:22:25,083 --> 01:22:26,125
I'll be waiting for you over there.

1193
01:22:26,375 --> 01:22:28,292
I'll take pictures...
"Get Driss ready..."

1194
01:22:29,167 --> 01:22:31,417
How are you gonna take pictures?

1195
01:22:31,792 --> 01:22:35,125
Laugh all you want.
I'm not doing this.

1196
01:22:47,958 --> 01:22:50,042
- I don't want to any more.
- Wait.

1197
01:22:50,375 --> 01:22:52,000
- Take it off.
- Wait, wait.

1198
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:54,375
I don't have to anyway, right?

1199
01:23:02,792 --> 01:23:04,417
Wait, what's going on?

1200
01:23:04,625 --> 01:23:05,583
Is something wrong?

1201
01:23:05,833 --> 01:23:07,292
Oh man.

1202
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,167
Fuck.

1203
01:23:10,417 --> 01:23:12,625
Why is it going higher?

1204
01:23:24,083 --> 01:23:25,458
What's going on?

1205
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:26,708
Oh my god.

1206
01:23:26,875 --> 01:23:28,000
Hey, Driss!

1207
01:23:29,417 --> 01:23:31,583
Relax, for god's sake.

1208
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,083
I'm relaxed. Can't we get down now?

1209
01:23:34,375 --> 01:23:36,250
I've seen it, it's cool.
I'm done.

1210
01:23:40,125 --> 01:23:41,542
What the hell!

1211
01:23:44,583 --> 01:23:47,042
What is happening now?

1212
01:23:52,917 --> 01:23:54,167
Come on, Driss.

1213
01:24:20,792 --> 01:24:22,000
Listen to this.

1214
01:24:22,667 --> 01:24:24,083
Where can you find a tetraplegic?

1215
01:24:24,333 --> 01:24:26,667
Where can you... I don't know.

1216
01:24:26,958 --> 01:24:29,625
Where you left him.

1217
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,458
Awful.

1218
01:24:32,667 --> 01:24:34,833
You're awful.

1219
01:24:36,708 --> 01:24:39,833
Driss, someone's here for you.

1220
01:24:41,583 --> 01:24:42,958
What are you doing here?

1221
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,083
Why did you hide this?

1222
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:47,667
- You answer the question.
- How did you find me?

1223
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,875
The social welfare sent this.
It mentions the address.

1224
01:24:51,833 --> 01:24:53,750
- And what's that?
- Nothing. Let it go.

1225
01:24:53,917 --> 01:24:56,000
- What did you do?
- I fell from my scooter.

1226
01:24:56,208 --> 01:24:57,667
- From your scooter?
- Yeah.

1227
01:24:57,875 --> 01:25:00,333
Bullshit. Get up.

1228
01:25:00,833 --> 01:25:03,042
This way.

1229
01:25:06,417 --> 01:25:08,000
Damn.

1230
01:25:11,708 --> 01:25:13,042
That's your room?

1231
01:25:13,292 --> 01:25:16,000
- Tell me what happened.
- Nothing.

1232
01:25:16,333 --> 01:25:19,167
- Tell me.
- It's none of your business.

1233
01:25:19,333 --> 01:25:22,083
How is it not my business?
You're hiding here but it's none of my business?

1234
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:24,667
We were only four and they screwed us.
But don't worry, they're gonna pay.

1235
01:25:24,792 --> 01:25:26,917
You're not gonna make anyone "pay".
Does mom know?

1236
01:25:27,125 --> 01:25:27,792
No.

1237
01:25:28,042 --> 01:25:30,042
- Don't worry, I have it covered.
- You have nothing covered.

1238
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:31,833
- You're a pain in the ass.
- Right.

1239
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,333
Now you stay here and
you don't touch anything.

1240
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:37,375
- Can I lie down?
- You don't touch anything!

1241
01:25:37,583 --> 01:25:39,167
Alright, I got it.

1242
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:41,542
Moron...

1243
01:25:45,208 --> 01:25:47,083
I'm telling you, he's with me.

1244
01:25:47,292 --> 01:25:48,708
Stop crying Mina.

1245
01:25:49,167 --> 01:25:51,667
He's not wounded, it's just a scratch.

1246
01:25:51,792 --> 01:25:52,750
He's fine.

1247
01:25:52,958 --> 01:25:56,917
Calm down, Mina.
Nobody's killing anybody.

1248
01:25:57,167 --> 01:25:58,333
Empty threats.
It's only words.

1249
01:25:58,667 --> 01:26:01,667
Meanwhile I can't take care of him.
I'm working.

1250
01:26:01,917 --> 01:26:04,333
No, don't tell her.

1251
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:08,167
You go crying in your room if you want,
but you don't tell her anything.

1252
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:17,750
I think it's time for bed.

1253
01:26:18,042 --> 01:26:20,458
I'm gonna stay up for a bit.

1254
01:26:21,125 --> 01:26:22,583
Sit down.

1255
01:26:24,333 --> 01:26:26,250
Sit down here.

1256
01:26:34,458 --> 01:26:37,375
What do you think of that woman?

1257
01:26:37,958 --> 01:26:41,083
- She looks hot.
- What else?

1258
01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:44,500
Can we go upstairs now...
I have something to deal with...

1259
01:26:44,792 --> 01:26:46,667
I imagine her getting up...

1260
01:26:46,958 --> 01:26:48,583
and turning around...

1261
01:26:48,875 --> 01:26:52,167
so that I can finally see her face.

1262
01:26:54,708 --> 01:26:56,417
The boy looks like you.

1263
01:26:56,625 --> 01:26:59,250
- Adama?
- Yes.

1264
01:26:59,542 --> 01:27:01,125
I saw him earlier.

1265
01:27:01,417 --> 01:27:03,292
I think if I had crossed
him in the street,

1266
01:27:03,625 --> 01:27:06,292
I could have told he was your brother.

1267
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:07,708
That's weird.

1268
01:27:08,958 --> 01:27:09,792
Why?

1269
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:12,875
Because he's not my brother.

1270
01:27:13,208 --> 01:27:14,375
Really?

1271
01:27:15,042 --> 01:27:16,917
It's complicated.

1272
01:27:18,083 --> 01:27:21,375
Is he your brother or not?

1273
01:27:25,542 --> 01:27:27,458
Ok. I get it.

1274
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:30,542
All right. Let's go.

1275
01:27:37,792 --> 01:27:39,958
My parents...

1276
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:43,167
they're not really my parents.

1277
01:27:43,333 --> 01:27:45,667
They're my uncle and my aunt.

1278
01:27:46,042 --> 01:27:49,500
They came to Senegal to get me when I was 8.

1279
01:27:49,833 --> 01:27:53,375
They couldn't have children, so they went
to see a brother who had a load of them.

1280
01:27:53,708 --> 01:27:55,875
They took the elder.

1281
01:27:56,333 --> 01:27:57,875
Me.

1282
01:28:00,250 --> 01:28:02,000
My name is Bakary.

1283
01:28:02,125 --> 01:28:05,167
That's my real name.

1284
01:28:05,458 --> 01:28:07,667
But there were several Bakarys in the
neighbourhood so they called me Idriss...

1285
01:28:08,083 --> 01:28:10,708
somehow it turned into Driss.

1286
01:28:11,458 --> 01:28:12,333
Then what?

1287
01:28:12,792 --> 01:28:16,208
Then out of nowhere my mother...
I mean my aunt...

1288
01:28:16,542 --> 01:28:19,375
she got pregnant twice.

1289
01:28:19,792 --> 01:28:21,042
Then my uncle died.

1290
01:28:21,375 --> 01:28:23,125
And then there were other guys,
other children.

1291
01:28:23,458 --> 01:28:26,083
I told you it's complicated.

1292
01:28:26,958 --> 01:28:32,167
About Adama. Don't you think
he needs a light admonition?

1293
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:42,667
He came to get you, didn't he?

1294
01:28:45,292 --> 01:28:46,417
Driss.

1295
01:28:49,875 --> 01:28:51,625
I think it's the end of the road.

1296
01:28:52,208 --> 01:28:56,375
You weren't going to push a
wheelchair your whole life anyway.

1297
01:28:56,667 --> 01:29:02,583
And since you worked well,
you deserve your unemployment again.

1298
01:29:05,625 --> 01:29:06,875
Enough.

1299
01:29:07,083 --> 01:29:08,333
Let's go.

1300
01:29:08,792 --> 01:29:09,958
Come on.

1301
01:29:10,333 --> 01:29:11,500
Yeah.

1302
01:29:15,250 --> 01:29:17,875
Vassary Bakary. Bakary Vassary.

1303
01:29:18,125 --> 01:29:19,042
It's beautiful.

1304
01:29:19,458 --> 01:29:20,917
Very poetic.

1305
01:29:21,333 --> 01:29:23,250
It has an alliteration.

1306
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:26,292
- Do you know what an alliteration is?
- No.

1307
01:29:29,333 --> 01:29:31,958
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Bastien. Thank you.

1308
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:35,750
Oh we're having a brunch tomorrow.
Could you bring something more...

1309
01:29:35,958 --> 01:29:36,917
Of course.

1310
01:29:37,042 --> 01:29:39,208
- Goodbye, Yvonne.
- You didn't forget my little treats, did you?

1311
01:29:39,333 --> 01:29:40,250
No.

1312
01:29:40,583 --> 01:29:42,542
- Good, thanks.
- Say hello to Elisa.

1313
01:29:42,917 --> 01:29:43,792
See you tomorrow.

1314
01:29:44,292 --> 01:29:47,167
Bastien, my friend. What's up?

1315
01:29:53,833 --> 01:29:55,083
So it's true.

1316
01:29:55,292 --> 01:29:56,792
- You're leaving.
- Yeah.

1317
01:29:57,083 --> 01:30:00,667
Don't worry, I have your number.
I'll call you... Keep in touch.

1318
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:04,708
- I know it's gonna be tough for you. Be strong.
- It's a shame.

1319
01:30:04,917 --> 01:30:08,458
You know I'm getting your room?
There's a water issue in mine.

1320
01:30:08,708 --> 01:30:10,583
I might stay, in the end.

1321
01:30:10,792 --> 01:30:13,375
We'd have to get warm in the bed together.

1322
01:30:13,792 --> 01:30:17,292
It would be a little too small.
I'm not alone.

1323
01:30:17,667 --> 01:30:18,792
Here she is.

1324
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,958
- This is Frédérique.
- Hello.

1325
01:30:24,625 --> 01:30:25,792
Hi.

1326
01:30:30,083 --> 01:30:31,208
I get it...

1327
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:34,125
- What?
- I understand, it's your...

1328
01:30:34,583 --> 01:30:36,667
So that's why...

1329
01:30:36,917 --> 01:30:38,500
Yes.

1330
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:40,750
Well.

1331
01:30:41,292 --> 01:30:44,833
I'm not giving you a kiss, then.

1332
01:30:49,083 --> 01:30:52,083
I have nothing a threesome you know.

1333
01:30:53,958 --> 01:30:56,042
Well... I'm down.

1334
01:30:56,292 --> 01:31:00,250
Not now though, I have to leave.
But I can come back.

1335
01:31:00,875 --> 01:31:04,375
- I have stuff to do, but I'll be back.
- I'm joking.

1336
01:31:08,042 --> 01:31:09,083
Alright...

1337
01:31:09,333 --> 01:31:11,750
See you, guys.

1338
01:31:14,042 --> 01:31:16,583
Mr Michel Sabourdy.

1339
01:31:21,417 --> 01:31:24,458
Keep it on all the time!
Channel 2.

1340
01:31:24,750 --> 01:31:26,333
Are you mad about Magali?

1341
01:31:26,542 --> 01:31:28,417
No. Nice one.

1342
01:31:28,875 --> 01:31:30,000
Nice one, but...

1343
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:34,250
it did seem weird that she would resist.
It never happened to me.

1344
01:31:38,292 --> 01:31:40,250
Kiss?

1345
01:31:41,375 --> 01:31:43,042
Yes. Sure.

1346
01:31:45,708 --> 01:31:47,625
Yvonne.

1347
01:31:48,917 --> 01:31:51,208
You're good...

1348
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:53,000
See you.

1349
01:31:53,292 --> 01:31:55,125
Yvonne.

1350
01:31:56,708 --> 01:31:58,125
Wait.

1351
01:32:03,875 --> 01:32:07,500
We won't need that any more.

1352
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:10,333
Bye.

1353
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:15,500
Watch your foot.

1354
01:32:15,667 --> 01:32:17,125
Let's go.

1355
01:32:32,417 --> 01:32:33,583
Wait.

1356
01:32:35,417 --> 01:32:36,792
What's your bank?

1357
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:38,500
Ok.

1358
01:32:38,708 --> 01:32:39,833
Excuse me.

1359
01:32:40,083 --> 01:32:43,625
Could you please move your car?
You can't park here.

1360
01:32:43,917 --> 01:32:44,958
It's written over there.

1361
01:32:45,417 --> 01:32:46,625
- I'm moving.
- Thanks.

1362
01:32:46,833 --> 01:32:48,750
I'll call you back.

1363
01:32:51,417 --> 01:32:54,250
Why do you mind?
We're not even driving.

1364
01:32:54,542 --> 01:32:56,708
It's a matter of principles.

1365
01:32:58,208 --> 01:32:59,333
Go on.

1366
01:32:59,917 --> 01:33:02,583
Wait for me over there.

1367
01:33:13,958 --> 01:33:15,458
What are you doing?

1368
01:33:16,417 --> 01:33:17,917
I'm coming.

1369
01:34:55,583 --> 01:34:57,958
I can cancel my date you know.

1370
01:34:58,083 --> 01:34:59,875
Of course not.
Why would you do that?

1371
01:35:00,042 --> 01:35:02,542
Have a good time.
Everything's fine.

1372
01:35:03,625 --> 01:35:05,708
Yvonne? I'm ready.

1373
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,792
Good. I'll be here in a minute.

1374
01:35:08,208 --> 01:35:09,708
Well, everything's ready.

1375
01:35:10,083 --> 01:35:11,667
You just have to serve.

1376
01:35:11,792 --> 01:35:16,042
Call me if anything's wrong.

1377
01:35:19,125 --> 01:35:21,833
- Call me, ok?
- Yeah.

1378
01:35:23,625 --> 01:35:26,958
So if you're ready,
I'm gonna serve your meal.

1379
01:35:27,333 --> 01:35:31,667
Take these scrubs off.
I feel like in an asylum.

1380
01:35:31,958 --> 01:35:34,708
- Alright.
- Do you have a cigarette?

1381
01:35:35,125 --> 01:35:37,958
No. I don't smoke. Not any more.

1382
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:42,083
To be honest, I gave up recently...

1383
01:35:42,292 --> 01:35:43,792
and you should do the same.

1384
01:35:44,042 --> 01:35:47,208
Even if you're not
exercising or something...

1385
01:35:47,417 --> 01:35:51,083
it's better for your lungs,
your breath.

1386
01:35:53,375 --> 01:35:55,292
You're not going to eat.

1387
01:36:57,167 --> 01:36:58,667
What the hell!

1388
01:36:59,292 --> 01:37:00,708
Come on. Be careful.

1389
01:37:00,958 --> 01:37:02,750
I'm sorry.

1390
01:37:03,083 --> 01:37:04,500
- Good morning, sir.
- What?

1391
01:37:04,750 --> 01:37:07,583
It's the person you asked for...

1392
01:37:07,875 --> 01:37:10,333
For the head massage.
It's Mr Jacquet.

1393
01:37:10,542 --> 01:37:11,667
Good morning.

1394
01:37:12,083 --> 01:37:13,083
Get out!

1395
01:37:13,375 --> 01:37:14,792
Leave me alone.

1396
01:37:15,042 --> 01:37:16,000
Leave!

1397
01:37:16,250 --> 01:37:18,583
- Did I say something wrong?
- No, no.

1398
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:21,500
He got up on the wrong side of the bed.

1399
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:25,917
"Got up on"... Idiot.

1400
01:37:26,542 --> 01:37:27,750
Moron.

1401
01:37:29,250 --> 01:37:30,333
Driss Vassary?

1402
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:32,750
- Yes.
- It's your turn.

1403
01:37:47,125 --> 01:37:49,625
You've only had your driving
license for a month.

1404
01:37:49,833 --> 01:37:52,083
Yes, but I've been driving for longer.

1405
01:37:52,333 --> 01:37:55,500
I mean I drove in private
ways, out of the roads...

1406
01:37:55,875 --> 01:37:57,667
Parking lots...

1407
01:37:58,208 --> 01:38:00,083
I'm a good driver.

1408
01:38:01,917 --> 01:38:03,833
I read your file.

1409
01:38:04,458 --> 01:38:08,792
In your personal evaluation
you wrote one single word: pragmatic.

1410
01:38:08,917 --> 01:38:10,083
Yes.

1411
01:38:10,667 --> 01:38:11,833
It is important.

1412
01:38:12,083 --> 01:38:15,750
You forgot to mention another
important aspect in our company.

1413
01:38:16,042 --> 01:38:17,000
Did I?

1414
01:38:18,167 --> 01:38:20,833
You could just take the time
to read the poster line.

1415
01:38:21,042 --> 01:38:23,083
Hey, that's an alexandrine.

1416
01:38:23,333 --> 01:38:24,250
Sorry?

1417
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:29,042
You-could-just-take-the-time
To-read-the-pos-ter-line

1418
01:38:29,417 --> 01:38:30,917
12 feet rhyme.

1419
01:38:31,333 --> 01:38:34,583
- That wasn't on purpose.
- Your catchphrase is "Just in time".

1420
01:38:34,917 --> 01:38:37,583
Oh that's why you put
Dali's watches..

1421
01:38:37,875 --> 01:38:39,792
A little artistic touch.

1422
01:38:40,167 --> 01:38:42,042
Maybe...

1423
01:38:43,292 --> 01:38:46,083
- You like paintings?
- I do.

1424
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:48,542
- I like Goya.
- She's alright...

1425
01:38:48,667 --> 01:38:53,333
...didn't sing much since Pandi-Panda.

1426
01:38:59,567 --> 01:39:00,817
Yes.

1427
01:39:02,607 --> 01:39:03,650
I'm coming.

1428
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:06,732
I'm on my way.

1429
01:39:10,482 --> 01:39:12,357
- Are you ok?
- Yes.

1430
01:39:12,692 --> 01:39:14,567
Leave me alone.

1431
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:18,232
Do you need water? A wet towel?

1432
01:39:19,607 --> 01:39:21,067
Get out.

1433
01:39:21,607 --> 01:39:24,692
- I mean I can...
- Leave me alone.

1434
01:39:31,775 --> 01:39:32,692
There.

1435
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:34,650
- Thanks, Bruno.
- You're welcome.

1436
01:39:34,857 --> 01:39:37,525
- Have a nice week-end.
- You too.

1437
01:39:37,817 --> 01:39:41,025
- What's going on?
- He's not doing well.

1438
01:39:41,275 --> 01:39:43,567
- Where is he now?
- He was in the garden earlier.

1439
01:39:43,982 --> 01:39:45,192
Ok.

1440
01:39:58,567 --> 01:39:59,732
So...

1441
01:39:59,942 --> 01:40:01,817
What's going on?

1442
01:40:02,107 --> 01:40:04,482
What's the deal with the beard?

1443
01:40:05,607 --> 01:40:06,857
Serpico?

1444
01:40:07,107 --> 01:40:09,650
Abraham Lincoln?
An old dude, anyway.

1445
01:40:10,107 --> 01:40:11,317
Victor Hugo.

1446
01:40:12,482 --> 01:40:14,482
You need a good shaving.
To take care of yourself.

1447
01:40:14,775 --> 01:40:16,192
It was high time I came back.

1448
01:40:16,482 --> 01:40:18,192
I'll be here in a minute.

1449
01:41:11,650 --> 01:41:13,400
Now what?

1450
01:41:14,067 --> 01:41:16,817
Now you let me handle it.

1451
01:43:00,607 --> 01:43:03,525
Don't you like that?

1452
01:43:24,482 --> 01:43:27,107
A sharp fast cut would relieve me.

1453
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:31,067
It's good to see you're doing better.

1454
01:43:35,250 --> 01:43:38,208
I did my best. Open your eyes.

1455
01:43:38,417 --> 01:43:39,833
Oh my god.

1456
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,333
It's terrible.

1457
01:43:41,583 --> 01:43:43,083
- It's really bad.
- No! It looks good.

1458
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:44,500
No.

1459
01:43:44,708 --> 01:43:45,500
Look...

1460
01:43:45,750 --> 01:43:48,333
leather jacket, without sleeves,
stud bracelets.

1461
01:43:48,667 --> 01:43:50,375
A Village People-like cap.

1462
01:43:50,708 --> 01:43:53,042
I know! José Bové.

1463
01:43:53,708 --> 01:43:55,667
You look exactly like him.

1464
01:43:56,042 --> 01:43:58,583
Really weird.
An orthodox priest or something.

1465
01:43:58,750 --> 01:44:01,375
- The pope.
- Exactly, the pope.

1466
01:44:02,333 --> 01:44:03,708
Come on.

1467
01:44:05,375 --> 01:44:06,792
He's crazy.

1468
01:44:07,083 --> 01:44:09,125
What are you up to?

1469
01:44:10,375 --> 01:44:14,000
- I'm scared.
- No you'll see, it's awesome.

1470
01:44:16,542 --> 01:44:18,000
I look like my grandfather.

1471
01:44:18,375 --> 01:44:19,292
Really?

1472
01:44:19,583 --> 01:44:24,083
Oh Philippe, the moustache is turning me on.
What is happening to me?

1473
01:44:24,833 --> 01:44:26,583
- Ok, I'll shave the rest.
- Thank you.

1474
01:44:26,917 --> 01:44:28,375
Alright.

1475
01:44:29,167 --> 01:44:31,625
No. Please. No.

1476
01:44:32,042 --> 01:44:33,167
No.

1477
01:44:33,542 --> 01:44:34,167
No.

1478
01:44:34,583 --> 01:44:35,708
Nein!

1479
01:44:35,958 --> 01:44:39,458
- Nein, is what you mean.
- I'm not ok with that.

1480
01:44:39,875 --> 01:44:42,292
Philippe, ach, nicht gut.

1481
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:45,417
So I'm your toy now.

1482
01:44:46,083 --> 01:44:48,292
You know you're mental, right?
You have to get help.

1483
01:44:48,542 --> 01:44:50,458
Don't you feel like invading
countries right now?

1484
01:44:50,667 --> 01:44:52,833
Ok, it would be best...

1485
01:44:53,208 --> 01:44:55,250
just to shave the rest.

1486
01:44:55,542 --> 01:44:56,833
You think it's funny?

1487
01:44:57,167 --> 01:44:59,292
Yes, I'm thinking about
tetraplegic nazis.

1488
01:44:59,625 --> 01:45:04,250
How could they do the sign?

1489
01:45:05,208 --> 01:45:08,167
Right. Now, you had fun. Shave it.

1490
01:45:19,625 --> 01:45:21,000
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

1491
01:45:21,292 --> 01:45:23,083
Vassary.
I have a reservation at 1 p.m.

1492
01:45:23,292 --> 01:45:26,250
- Yes. Vassary. Table 8.
- Follow me, please.

1493
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:33,750
- Over here.
- Thank you.

1494
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:36,083
Thank you, sir.

1495
01:45:54,792 --> 01:45:56,292
So, Philippe...

1496
01:45:56,542 --> 01:45:58,833
I'm not staying for lunch.

1497
01:45:59,917 --> 01:46:02,333
- Why?
- I'm not leaving you alone.

1498
01:46:03,042 --> 01:46:06,375
You just happen to have a date.

1499
01:46:06,917 --> 01:46:08,125
A date?

1500
01:46:08,458 --> 01:46:09,958
What do you mean?

1501
01:46:10,792 --> 01:46:12,250
Don't freak out. It'll be fine.

1502
01:46:12,625 --> 01:46:13,500
What the...

1503
01:46:13,792 --> 01:46:17,083
Only this time you can't flee.

1504
01:46:18,125 --> 01:46:19,625
By the way...

1505
01:46:21,042 --> 01:46:24,333
I took my time, but I found it.

1506
01:46:24,583 --> 01:46:26,833
Give her a big kiss for me.

1507
01:46:27,958 --> 01:46:29,167
Driss!

1508
01:46:30,667 --> 01:46:31,958
Driss!

1509
01:46:34,667 --> 01:46:37,333
What's going on?

1510
01:46:56,917 --> 01:46:59,750
Hello, Philippe.

1511
01:47:38,625 --> 01:47:45,042
Philippe Pozzo Di Borgo now lives in Morocco.
He's married again, and has two daughters.

1512
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:54,583
Abdel Sellou now owns a company.
He's married and has three children.

1513
01:48:12,958 --> 01:48:17,708
Philippe and Abdel
remained close friends.

1514

Enjoy!
