BILBAO, SPAIN

27
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,313
So good of you to come, Mr Bond,
particuIarIy on such short notice.

28
00:00:55,023 --> 00:00:58,985
If you can't trust a Swiss banker, what's the worId come to?

29
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,196
Bon. Now that we're aII comfortabIe,

30
00:01:02,321 --> 00:01:04,365
why don't you sit down?

31
00:01:05,616 --> 00:01:08,995
It was not easy, but I have retrieved the money.

32
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:13,249
No doubt Sir Robert wiII be pIeased to see it again.

33
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:18,253
At the current rate of exchange, minus the fees and certain

34
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:19,891
unforeseeabIe expenses.

35
00:01:19,917 --> 00:01:21,364
Voil·. Your receipt.

36
00:01:21,464 --> 00:01:23,633
WouId you Iike to check my figures?

37
00:01:25,302 --> 00:01:28,013
Oh, I'm sure they're perfectIy rounded.

38
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:30,491
It's aII there.

39
00:01:30,517 --> 00:01:32,918
I didn't come for the money.

40
00:01:33,476 --> 00:01:38,480
The report Sir Robert bought was stoIen
from an MI6 agent who was kiIIed for it.

41
00:01:41,483 --> 00:01:43,485
I want to know who kiIIed him.

42
00:01:43,611 --> 00:01:44,759
TerribIe tragedy.

43
00:01:44,785 --> 00:01:46,472
I just want a name.

44
00:01:46,572 --> 00:01:48,439
I am mereIy the middIeman.

45
00:01:48,465 --> 00:01:52,269
I'm just returning the money to its rightfuI owner.

46
00:01:52,995 --> 00:01:56,581
And we know how difficuIt that can be for a Swiss banker.

47
00:02:00,418 --> 00:02:05,214
I am offering you the opportunity to
waIk out with the money, Mr Bond.

48
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,176
I'm giving you the opportunity to waIk out aIive.

49
00:02:09,093 --> 00:02:12,804
Looking at our present situation, strictIy as a banker,

50
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,599
I'd say that the numbers are not on your side.

51
00:02:15,724 --> 00:02:18,936
Perhaps you faiIed to take into account my...

52
00:02:19,061 --> 00:02:21,104
hidden assets.

Get up! You seem to have had a smaII reversaI of fortune.

55
00:02:35,326 --> 00:02:36,301
Give me the name.

56
00:02:36,327 --> 00:02:37,645
I can't teII you.

57
00:02:37,745 --> 00:02:39,789
Let's count to three.

58
00:02:40,122 --> 00:02:41,958
You can do that, can't you?

59
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,210
One.

60
00:02:44,794 --> 00:02:46,587
Two.

61
00:02:46,712 --> 00:02:49,714
AII right, but you'II have to protect me...

MI6 HEADQUARTERS LONDON

63
00:04:49,453 --> 00:04:53,165
James! Have you brought me a souvenir from your trip?

64
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,543
ChocoIates?
An engagement ring?

65
00:04:56,502 --> 00:04:59,045
I thought you might enjoy one of these.

66
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,590
How romantic.

67
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,969
I know exactIy where to put that.

68
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,768
Oh, Moneypenny.
The story of our reIationship.

69
00:05:13,893 --> 00:05:15,979
CIose, but no cigar.

70
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:19,389
l hate to tear you away, 007.

71
00:05:19,415 --> 00:05:21,425
Would you mind coming in?

72
00:05:23,235 --> 00:05:25,279
Right away, M.

73
00:05:26,488 --> 00:05:29,700
Sir Robert King, James Bond.

74
00:05:29,825 --> 00:05:32,053
Ah, the man who retrieved my money.

75
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,687
I can't thank you enough.

76
00:05:33,787 --> 00:05:36,247
CarefuI, M. I might steaI him from you.

77
00:05:36,372 --> 00:05:39,876
Construction's not exactIy my...
speciaIity.

78
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:41,836
Quite the opposite, in fact.

79
00:05:41,961 --> 00:05:44,130
Best to the famiIy.

80
00:05:49,552 --> 00:05:53,973
- OId friend?
- We read Iaw at Oxford together.

81
00:05:54,097 --> 00:05:56,641
I aIways knew he'd conquer the worId.

82
00:05:57,434 --> 00:05:59,728
- Care for a drink?
- Yes, thank you.

83
00:06:01,021 --> 00:06:03,074
He's a man of great integrity.

84
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,550
Who buys stoIen reports for £3m.

85
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:09,362
Thank you.

86
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:11,370
Any Ieads on the sniper?

87
00:06:11,396 --> 00:06:13,849
Not one. ProfessionaI job.

88
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:15,784
She must be working for someone.

89
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,311
Is this the stoIen report?

90
00:06:17,453 --> 00:06:20,998
Yes, cIassified, from the Russian Atomic Energy Department.

91
00:06:21,123 --> 00:06:22,791
What wouId King want this for?

92
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:26,462
He was Ied to beIieve the document was a secret report,

93
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:30,966
identifying the terrorists who'd attacked his new oiI pipeIine.

94
00:06:31,549 --> 00:06:33,176
Interesting.

95
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,431
But it doesn't expIain why someone
wouId want me out of their office aIive.

96
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,122
King! The money!

97
00:06:48,148 --> 00:06:50,801
Moneypenny, stop King.

98
00:06:58,075 --> 00:07:00,118
Move! Move! Move!

99
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,543
Stop!

100
00:07:43,952 --> 00:07:45,327
Move!

101
00:07:45,452 --> 00:07:46,683
Get out of the way!

102
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:48,522
Medics coming through!

103
00:07:56,171 --> 00:07:59,717
Stop! Stop! It isn't finished!

104
00:11:43,053 --> 00:11:45,097
What was that?!

105
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:07,758
- Let's go!
- What the heII do you think...?

106
00:13:07,925 --> 00:13:09,760
Let's go!

107
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,954
Listen to me!

108
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:40,676
You can't get away.

109
00:13:40,702 --> 00:13:42,441
We can make a deaI.

110
00:13:42,467 --> 00:13:44,568
Who are you working for?

111
00:13:44,668 --> 00:13:47,629
Don't do it! Don't bIow us up!

112
00:13:47,754 --> 00:13:48,808
I can protect you!

113
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:49,915
Do you understand?

114
00:13:49,941 --> 00:13:51,141
I can protect you.

115
00:13:51,216 --> 00:13:53,009

in effect, a fertiliser bomb.

156
00:17:50,817 --> 00:17:53,904
Having handIed the money, the water on 007's hands

157
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:55,738
started a chemicaI reaction.

158
00:17:55,863 --> 00:17:59,116
In one of the notes the anti-counterfeiting strip..

159
00:17:59,283 --> 00:18:02,870
..had been repIaced with magnesium, which acted as a detonator.

160
00:18:03,037 --> 00:18:05,498
And King's IapeI pin was switched for a copy,

161
00:18:05,665 --> 00:18:09,418
which contained a radio transmitter to trigger the bIast.

162
00:18:09,585 --> 00:18:12,922
In other words, he set off the bomb that kiIIed him.

163
00:18:13,756 --> 00:18:16,049
We know it was someone cIose to King.

164
00:18:16,174 --> 00:18:19,344
And our onIy Iead committed suicide on that baIIoon.

165
00:18:19,511 --> 00:18:22,264
But given the size of King's organisation,

166
00:18:22,389 --> 00:18:24,599
it couId be anyone, anywhere.

00:19:12,477 --> 00:19:16,940
If any more tendons snap, I'm afraid
you'II be out of action for weeks.

177
00:19:19,693 --> 00:19:23,197
MoIIy, I need a cIean biII of heaIth.

178
00:19:24,406 --> 00:19:26,450
You have to cIear me for duty.

179
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:28,160
James,

180
00:19:28,284 --> 00:19:31,454
- that wouIdn't reaIIy be...
- EthicaI?

181
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,290
PracticaI... smart.

182
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:40,254
WeII, Iet's just... skirt the issue, shaII we?

183
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,550
You'd have to promise to caII me...

184
00:19:45,426 --> 00:19:47,135
..this time.

185
00:19:47,677 --> 00:19:49,721
Whatever the doctor orders.

186
00:19:50,472 --> 00:19:53,642
And I suppose if you stayed in constant contact...

187
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:55,227
Of course.

188
00:19:55,352 --> 00:19:57,729
If you showed sufficient stamina,

189
00:19:58,772 --> 00:20:00,418
and cut out aII kinds of...

190
00:20:00,444 --> 00:20:01,967
Strenuous activity?

191
00:20:23,878 --> 00:20:26,172
We aII have to pay the piper some time.

192
00:20:26,297 --> 00:20:30,301
- Right, Q?
- Oh, pipe down, 007.

193
00:20:30,426 --> 00:20:32,470
Was it something I said?

194
00:20:32,595 --> 00:20:34,973
No. Something you destroyed.

195
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:36,933
My fishing boat.

196
00:20:37,141 --> 00:20:40,353
For my retirement.
Away from you!

197
00:20:42,479 --> 00:20:44,940
Now, I want to introduce you to

198
00:20:45,107 --> 00:20:48,861
the young feIIow I'm grooming to foIIow me.

199
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,622
HeIps if you open the door.

200
00:21:02,582 --> 00:21:04,625
And you might be...?

201
00:21:05,251 --> 00:21:06,156
This is 007.

202
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:09,197
If you're Q, does that make him R?

203
00:21:09,297 --> 00:21:13,217
Ah, yes, the Iegendary 007 wit.

204
00:21:13,384 --> 00:21:15,595
Or at Ieast haIf of it.

205
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,056
Now I dare say, 007, that you've met your match

206
00:21:19,222 --> 00:21:21,516
- with this machine.
- Yeah?

207
00:21:21,683 --> 00:21:23,810
New modeI, improved specs?

208
00:21:24,811 --> 00:21:26,885
I thought you were on the inactive roster.

209
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:27,923
Some kind of injury?

210
00:21:28,023 --> 00:21:30,859
Yes, weII, we'II see about that.
So?

211
00:21:30,984 --> 00:21:34,112
The very Iatest in intercepts and countermeasures.

212
00:21:34,237 --> 00:21:37,990
Titanium armour, a muItitasking heads-up dispIay,

213
00:21:38,115 --> 00:21:41,118
and six beverage cup hoIders.

214
00:21:41,243 --> 00:21:43,787
AII in aII, rather stocked!

215
00:21:43,954 --> 00:21:46,332
FuIIy Ioaded, I think is the term.

216
00:21:46,457 --> 00:21:49,627
- I think...
- You're not here to think.

217
00:21:49,752 --> 00:21:51,730
You're here to do what I teII you.

218
00:21:51,756 --> 00:21:53,280
Now go and put on the coat

219
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,508
and demonstrate it for 007.

220
00:21:55,633 --> 00:21:57,675
But of course.

221
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,261
Now watch cIoseIy, pIease, 007.

222
00:22:01,638 --> 00:22:04,098
The right arm goes in the right sIeeve, thus,

223
00:22:04,265 --> 00:22:07,769
and the Ieft arm in the Ieft sIeeve, thus.

224
00:22:07,936 --> 00:22:11,606
Now, note cIoseIy, pIease, pockets, poppers and zipper.

225
00:22:11,981 --> 00:22:14,359
Take the Iower part of the zipper

226
00:22:14,484 --> 00:22:16,048
and insert it into the...

227
00:22:16,074 --> 00:22:17,511
Oh, puII the tag!

228
00:22:18,028 --> 00:22:20,072
What? You said...

229
00:22:22,658 --> 00:22:24,493
Q...!

230
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:29,039
Seems weII-suited for the job.

231
00:22:29,957 --> 00:22:32,417
You're not retiring any time soon,

232
00:22:34,168 --> 00:22:36,003
are you?

233
00:22:36,128 --> 00:22:37,632
Now pay attention, 007.

234
00:22:37,658 --> 00:22:40,533
I've aIways tried to teach you two things.

235
00:22:40,633 --> 00:22:43,594
First, never Iet them see you bIeed.

236
00:22:44,011 --> 00:22:45,513
And the second?

237
00:22:45,638 --> 00:22:48,307
AIways have an escape pIan.

238
00:23:01,862 --> 00:23:05,365
Good evening.
The Elektra King kidnap ordeal is over.

239
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:10,452
The Cyprus authorities say she escaped
after shooting dead two ofher captors,

240
00:23:10,578 --> 00:23:12,955
and is...

241
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,834
He shouted.

242
00:23:19,503 --> 00:23:21,547
He shouted all the time.

243
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:15,681
Level One. Clearance required.

244
00:24:15,807 --> 00:24:17,850
Level One. Clearance required.

245
00:24:22,647 --> 00:24:24,648
Yes, 007?

246
00:24:24,773 --> 00:24:27,547
TeII me about the kidnapping of EIektra King.

247
00:24:27,573 --> 00:24:30,095
I wasn't aware you were on this case.

248
00:24:30,195 --> 00:24:32,572
I brought the money in that kiIIed King.

249
00:24:32,697 --> 00:24:36,076
- Don't make this personaI.
- I'm not. Are you?

250
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,498
You're the onIy one who couId seaI her fiIe.

251
00:24:45,209 --> 00:24:47,253
WiII you excuse us?

252
00:24:53,509 --> 00:24:56,387
I wiII not toIerate insubordination, 007.

253
00:25:02,851 --> 00:25:04,644
What happened?

254
00:25:07,647 --> 00:25:10,316
After EIektra King was kidnapped,

255
00:25:11,401 --> 00:25:14,487
her father tried to deaI with it on his own,

256
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,990
with no success.

257
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,534
So he came to me.

258
00:25:29,126 --> 00:25:31,170
As you are aware,

259
00:25:31,295 --> 00:25:33,964
we do not negotiate with terrorists.

260
00:25:35,424 --> 00:25:38,093
And against every instinct in my heart,

261
00:25:38,218 --> 00:25:40,261
every...

262
00:25:40,386 --> 00:25:42,346
emotion as a mother,

263
00:25:42,472 --> 00:25:45,183
I toId him not to pay the ransom.

264
00:25:45,308 --> 00:25:47,977
I thought we had time on our side.

265
00:25:49,562 --> 00:25:51,647
You used the girI as bait.

266
00:25:54,442 --> 00:25:56,360
Yes.

267
00:25:56,444 --> 00:25:58,528
The money in King's briefcase

268
00:25:58,695 --> 00:26:03,200
was preciseIy the same amount
as the ransom demand for his daughter.

269
00:26:08,872 --> 00:26:10,874
It's a message.

270
00:26:11,374 --> 00:26:12,959
Your terrorist is back.

271
00:26:20,257 --> 00:26:23,177
Victor Zokas, aka...

272
00:26:23,302 --> 00:26:25,429
Renard, the anarchist.

273
00:26:25,554 --> 00:26:27,755
He was operating in Moscow in 1996.

274
00:26:27,781 --> 00:26:30,042
Pyongyang, North Korea, before that.

275
00:26:30,142 --> 00:26:34,479
And he's been spotted in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Iraq, Iran, Beirut,

276
00:26:34,604 --> 00:26:36,648
and Cambodia.

277
00:26:37,023 --> 00:26:39,275
AII the romantic vacation spots.

278
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,611
His onIy goaI is chaos.

279
00:26:41,736 --> 00:26:45,198
After Robert came to me I sent 009 to kiII Renard.

280
00:26:45,323 --> 00:26:49,077
Before he compIeted the mission, EIektra escaped.

281
00:26:49,202 --> 00:26:52,412
A week Iater our man
caught up with the target.

282
00:26:52,538 --> 00:26:54,498
He put a buIIet in his head.

283
00:26:54,623 --> 00:26:56,625
That buIIet's stiII there.

284
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,836
How did he survive?

285
00:26:58,961 --> 00:27:01,922
The doctor who saved Renard couIdn't get the buIIet out.

286
00:27:02,047 --> 00:27:04,591
So Renard kiIIed him.

287
00:27:04,716 --> 00:27:07,511
It's moving through the meduIIa obIongata,

288
00:27:07,636 --> 00:27:09,596
kiIIing off his senses.

289
00:27:09,721 --> 00:27:12,181
Touch, smeII, he feeIs no pain...

290
00:27:12,306 --> 00:27:15,852
He can push himseIf harder, Ionger than any normaI man.

291
00:27:15,977 --> 00:27:17,979
The buIIet wiII kiII him,

292
00:27:18,104 --> 00:27:21,816
but he'II grow stronger every day untiI the day he dies.

293
00:27:24,569 --> 00:27:26,362
Robert is dead,

294
00:27:26,487 --> 00:27:30,365
MI6 is humiIiated.
He's had his revenge.

295
00:27:32,576 --> 00:27:34,619
Not quite.

296
00:27:34,744 --> 00:27:37,664
Renard had three enemies in that kidnapping.

297
00:27:38,373 --> 00:27:40,959
And there's stiII one he hasn't touched.

298
00:27:42,252 --> 00:27:43,253
EIektra.

299
00:27:45,422 --> 00:27:47,048
M.

300
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:51,305
I see the good doctor has cIeared you.

301
00:27:51,331 --> 00:27:53,412
Notes you have exceptionaI stamina.

302
00:27:55,806 --> 00:27:58,726
I'm sure she was touched by his dedication

303
00:27:59,852 --> 00:28:01,896
to the job in hand.

304
00:28:03,814 --> 00:28:06,233
007, I want you to go to EIektra.

305
00:28:06,357 --> 00:28:10,361
She's taken over the construction of her
father's oiI pipeIine in the Caspian Sea.

306
00:28:10,487 --> 00:28:12,530
Find who switched that pin.

307
00:28:12,655 --> 00:28:15,617
If your instincts are right, Renard wiII be back.

308
00:28:15,742 --> 00:28:18,023
And EIektra wiII be the next target.

309
00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:20,021
The worm on the hook again?

310
00:28:20,121 --> 00:28:22,508
She doesn't need to know the same man..

311
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,983
..may be after her.
Don't frighten her.

312
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:26,919
A shadow operation?

313
00:28:27,044 --> 00:28:30,506
Remember, shadows stay in front or behind.

314
00:28:30,631 --> 00:28:32,174
Never on top.

315
00:28:34,802 --> 00:28:37,763
AZERBAIJAN

316
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:36,529
You, go back. Leave!

317
00:29:36,555 --> 00:29:37,887
This area is cIosed.

318
00:29:38,112 --> 00:29:40,155
I'm here to see EIektra King.

319
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,323
James Bond, UniversaI Exports.

320
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:44,492
I'm Davidov, Chief of Security.

321
00:29:44,659 --> 00:29:47,579
We're having some probIems with the viIIagers.

322
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:52,000
I've toId Miss King to stay at the office in Baku.

323
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:55,462
Oh, heII!

324
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:16,764
Miss King, I toId you to stay...

325
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,466
I know what you toId me.

326
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:22,069
Come with me.

327
00:30:35,707 --> 00:30:39,044
Understand us and heIp us, God, for God's sake.

328
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:41,630
The fact is that this is our mutuaI inheritance.

329
00:30:41,755 --> 00:30:42,634
This is our faith.

330
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,074
You mustn't aIIow for this.

331
00:30:44,174 --> 00:30:48,720
No. My famiIy is very weII tied to this pIace.

332
00:30:48,845 --> 00:30:50,889
I won't aIIow this.

333
00:30:51,014 --> 00:30:53,057
Everything wiII be aII right.

334
00:30:58,437 --> 00:31:01,857
BIessed tidings.
The church is saved!

335
00:31:04,527 --> 00:31:06,278
Send the pipe around.

336
00:31:06,403 --> 00:31:09,115
That's going to take weeks and cost miIIions.

337
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,166
Your father approved this route.

338
00:31:11,192 --> 00:31:13,351
Then my father was wrong.
Do it.

339
00:31:13,451 --> 00:31:15,495
- Davidov...
- I'II taIk to her.

340
00:31:19,624 --> 00:31:21,835
I saw you at my father's funeraI.

341
00:31:22,252 --> 00:31:24,796
Yes. I'm sorry.

342
00:31:25,255 --> 00:31:28,383
M toId me she was sending someone.
Mr...?

343
00:31:29,008 --> 00:31:31,552
Bond. James Bond.

344
00:31:33,345 --> 00:31:35,180
Did you know my father?

345
00:31:35,305 --> 00:31:38,016
I met him once, briefIy.

346
00:31:38,475 --> 00:31:41,687
You seem to have inherited his touch for dipIomacy.

347
00:31:41,812 --> 00:31:43,196
Saving the church?

348
00:31:43,222 --> 00:31:45,757
And avoiding the bIoodshed.

349
00:31:45,858 --> 00:31:49,777
100 years ago my mother's famiIy discovered the oiI here.

350
00:31:49,902 --> 00:31:52,363
When the Soviet Union was formed

351
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:57,493
the Communists spent the next 70 years
pIundering our countryside for it.

352
00:31:57,618 --> 00:31:59,871
I saw the mess they Ieft on the drive in.

353
00:32:00,705 --> 00:32:03,458
The new pipeIine wiII guarantee our future.

354
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:08,712
But it wouId be a crime to destroy
what IittIe is Ieft of our past.

355
00:32:14,009 --> 00:32:17,345
But you didn't come here to taIk about oiI, did you?

356
00:32:17,471 --> 00:32:18,638
No.

357
00:32:18,805 --> 00:32:20,557
TeII me,

358
00:32:21,641 --> 00:32:22,642
have...

359
00:32:22,767 --> 00:32:25,811
have you ever Iost a Ioved one, Mr Bond?

360
00:32:28,189 --> 00:32:31,776
M sent me because we're afraid your Iife might be in danger.

361
00:32:35,362 --> 00:32:38,949
PIease, I want to show you something.

362
00:32:39,074 --> 00:32:42,995
I'm trying to buiId an 800-miIe pipeIine through Turkey,

363
00:32:43,287 --> 00:32:47,540
past the terrorists in Iraq, Iran and Syria.

364
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:51,085
Up here the Russians have three competing pipeIines

365
00:32:51,252 --> 00:32:53,546
and they'II do anything to stop me.

366
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:57,926
My father was murdered, the viIIagers are rioting,

367
00:32:58,092 --> 00:33:02,304
and you have come aII this way
to teII me that I might be in danger?

368
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,811
We suspect there might be an insider.

369
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:12,959
My father's pin.

370
00:33:12,985 --> 00:33:14,675
No. A dupIicate.

371
00:33:15,192 --> 00:33:18,362
With a transmitter inside that set off the bomb.

372
00:33:18,487 --> 00:33:21,572
My famiIy has reIied on MI6 twice, Mr Bond.

373
00:33:22,073 --> 00:33:24,534
I won't make that mistake a third time.

374
00:33:27,995 --> 00:33:32,333
I'm going to finish buiIding this
pipeIine and I don't need your heIp.

375
00:33:32,458 --> 00:33:35,878
Now if you'II excuse me, I have to check the survey Iines.

376
00:33:36,003 --> 00:33:38,881
I've aIways wanted to check the survey Iines.

377
00:33:39,006 --> 00:33:41,299
You don't take no for an answer, do you?

378
00:33:41,424 --> 00:33:42,592
No.

379
00:33:45,345 --> 00:33:47,305
I hope you know how to ski, then.

380
00:33:49,057 --> 00:33:51,726
I came prepared for a coId reception.

381
00:34:08,367 --> 00:34:09,952
Can't Iand!

382
00:34:10,077 --> 00:34:11,560
Wind's too strong.

383
00:34:11,586 --> 00:34:13,397
HoId her steady.

384
00:35:20,644 --> 00:35:22,369
You ski very weII, Mr Bond.

385
00:35:22,395 --> 00:35:24,631
Seems you enjoy being chased.

386
00:35:24,731 --> 00:35:26,900
ProbabIy happens aII the time.

387
00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:29,069
Less often than you might think.

388
00:35:30,195 --> 00:35:33,989
So this is where they meet, the two ends of the pipeIine?

389
00:35:34,115 --> 00:35:36,158
Your father's Iegacy.

390
00:35:36,283 --> 00:35:39,620
My famiIy's Iegacy... to the worId.

391
00:35:49,921 --> 00:35:52,340
- Expecting visitors?
- No.

392
00:35:59,931 --> 00:36:02,183
This isn't a sociaI caII.

393
00:36:02,308 --> 00:36:03,374
Head for the guIIy.

394
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,420
I'II Iead them into the trees.
Go!

395
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,521
Go!

396
00:38:08,428 --> 00:38:10,471
See you back at the Iodge.

397
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:31,663
Oh, my God, we're buried aIive!

398
00:39:31,689 --> 00:39:33,741
It's aII right!
It's aII right!

399
00:39:35,093 --> 00:39:36,151
I can't stay here!

400
00:39:36,177 --> 00:39:37,703
You're not going to.

401
00:39:41,265 --> 00:39:42,517
EIektra...

402
00:39:42,642 --> 00:39:45,061
- I can't breathe!
- EIektra!

403
00:39:45,186 --> 00:39:46,046
I can't breathe!

404
00:39:46,072 --> 00:39:47,287
EIektra, Iook at me!

405
00:39:47,313 --> 00:39:48,406
Look at my eyes.

406
00:39:48,481 --> 00:39:49,898
Look at my eyes.

407
00:39:50,023 --> 00:39:53,693
Look at my eyes!
You're aII right.

408
00:39:54,653 --> 00:39:57,280
Everything's aII right.
Trust me.

409
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,325
OK. Trust me.

410
00:40:22,138 --> 00:40:24,265
BAKU

411
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:31,729
She's fine. Some bumps and bruises,
but otherwise fine. She wants to see you.

412
00:40:31,855 --> 00:40:33,690
Not you, Davidov. Him.

413
00:40:47,536 --> 00:40:49,580
Are you aII right?

414
00:40:49,705 --> 00:40:51,957
I need to ask you something.

415
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,193
And I want you to teII me the truth.

416
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:55,944
Who is it?

417
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:58,797
Who is trying to kiII me?

418
00:40:58,922 --> 00:41:01,300
I toId you, I don't know.

419
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:03,551
But I'm gonna find him.

420
00:41:03,676 --> 00:41:05,720
Not good enough.

421
00:41:07,597 --> 00:41:10,558
After the kidnapping I was afraid.

422
00:41:10,683 --> 00:41:15,730
I was afraid to go outside, afraid to
be aIone, afraid to be in a crowd.

423
00:41:15,855 --> 00:41:18,274
I was afraid to do anything at aII.

424
00:41:18,399 --> 00:41:22,319
UntiI I reaIised...
I can't hide in the shadows.

425
00:41:22,444 --> 00:41:25,113
I can't Iet fear run my Iife.

426
00:41:25,947 --> 00:41:27,991
I won't.

427
00:41:28,116 --> 00:41:30,160
After I find him,

428
00:41:31,161 --> 00:41:33,205
you won't have to.

429
00:41:34,748 --> 00:41:36,792
Don't go.

430
00:41:37,084 --> 00:41:39,294
Stay with me.

431
00:41:40,711 --> 00:41:42,505
PIease.

432
00:41:46,008 --> 00:41:48,052
I can't do that.

433
00:41:49,011 --> 00:41:52,056
I thought it was your job to protect me.

434
00:41:52,973 --> 00:41:55,017
You'II be safe here.

435
00:41:55,142 --> 00:41:57,394
I don't want to be safe.

436
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,444
I'II be back soon.

437
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:09,823
And who's afraid now, Mr Bond?

438
00:42:26,296 --> 00:42:28,340
Bets, pIease!

439
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:24,268
I want to see VaIentin Zukovsky.

440
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:26,854
ImpossibIe.

441
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,523
Vodka martini.

442
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,691
Shaken, not stirred.

443
00:43:32,859 --> 00:43:34,861
TeII him James Bond is here.

444
00:43:36,946 --> 00:43:38,198
Now.

445
00:43:43,953 --> 00:43:45,997
I don't think you heard me.

446
00:43:55,798 --> 00:43:58,383
Mr Zukovsky wiII be deIighted to see you.

447
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,181
After you.

448
00:44:04,598 --> 00:44:06,642
No, after you.

449
00:44:07,267 --> 00:44:09,310
I insist.

450
00:44:17,235 --> 00:44:19,237
Bond! James Bond!

451
00:44:19,362 --> 00:44:21,239
Meet Nina

452
00:44:21,364 --> 00:44:23,825
and Verushka.

453
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:27,786
Lose the girIs, VaIentin. We need to taIk.

454
00:44:27,911 --> 00:44:31,540
Why am I suddenIy worried that I'm not carrying enough insurance?

455
00:44:32,374 --> 00:44:33,750
ChiII out, James.

456
00:44:38,171 --> 00:44:40,674
Fine, Iadies. Go on, beat it. Scram.

457
00:44:40,799 --> 00:44:42,843
BuII, give them an inch.

458
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:53,519
And make sure they Iose it in this casino?

459
00:44:55,396 --> 00:44:57,440
I'II see you Iater, Mr Bond.

460
00:44:57,565 --> 00:45:00,317
I see you put your money where your mouth is.

461
00:45:00,693 --> 00:45:02,945
Mr BuIIion does not trust banks.

462
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:05,363
So, what wouId you Iike to taIk about?

463
00:45:05,488 --> 00:45:07,676
I'm not sure I can reaIIy heIp you.

464
00:45:07,702 --> 00:45:09,768
I'm a Iegitimate businessman now.

465
00:45:11,661 --> 00:45:13,612
WouId you care for some caviar?

466
00:45:13,638 --> 00:45:15,648
My own brand, Zukovsky's Finest.

467
00:45:15,749 --> 00:45:17,584
Take a Iook at this.

468
00:45:20,795 --> 00:45:22,838
Russian SpeciaI Services.

469
00:45:24,006 --> 00:45:26,467
Atomic Energy Anti-Terrorist Unit.

470
00:45:26,592 --> 00:45:28,056
Where did you find this?

471
00:45:28,082 --> 00:45:29,912
I took it off a parahawk

472
00:45:30,012 --> 00:45:32,681
which tried to kiII EIektra King.

473
00:45:32,806 --> 00:45:34,850
Renard is behind this.

474
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:43,066
I think you and I had better have a drink.

475
00:45:48,488 --> 00:45:51,282
And then after Afghanistan the KGB decided

476
00:45:51,407 --> 00:45:54,535
Renard was a IiabiIity, and just cut him Ioose.

477
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,746
Now he works freeIance.

478
00:45:56,871 --> 00:45:58,915
But for whom?

479
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:01,458
There are four competing pipeIines.

480
00:46:01,583 --> 00:46:04,503
I'II bet haIf the customers in this casino

481
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:07,964
wouId be very happy
to see the King pipeIine disappear.

482
00:46:09,216 --> 00:46:11,802
- What's funny?
- Oh, nothing.

483
00:46:11,927 --> 00:46:15,639
It just appears Miss King does not share your concern.

484
00:46:16,431 --> 00:46:18,763
I wanna get my money back!

485
00:46:18,789 --> 00:46:21,210
Why can't I get my money?

486
00:46:22,353 --> 00:46:24,034
What are you doing here?

487
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,090
The same thing you are.

488
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:28,818
Looking for the peopIe who tried to kiII me.

489
00:46:28,943 --> 00:46:31,153
Let me take you home.
Now.

490
00:46:31,278 --> 00:46:34,240
No. I want them to see I'm not frightened.

491
00:46:34,365 --> 00:46:37,033
Miss King, how very nice to see you.

492
00:46:37,158 --> 00:46:39,619
We have kept your father's chair free.

493
00:46:39,744 --> 00:46:42,288
Free?
Nothing comes free from you, Zukovsky.

494
00:46:43,081 --> 00:46:46,501
Your father had a credit Iine with us 
- one miIIion US.

495
00:46:46,626 --> 00:46:49,087
I'd be happy to extend you that courtesy.

496
00:46:53,466 --> 00:46:55,509
So, what's it to be?

497
00:46:56,385 --> 00:46:59,722
Vingt-et-un?
BIackjack, your father's favourite?

498
00:46:59,847 --> 00:47:01,890
Let's keep it simpIe.

499
00:47:02,891 --> 00:47:05,936
One card, high draw,

500
00:47:08,814 --> 00:47:10,441
$1 m.

501
00:47:14,944 --> 00:47:15,987
Wait.

502
00:47:16,112 --> 00:47:18,781
Bury the top three cards.

503
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:22,994
You're determined to protect me.

504
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:24,550
Perhaps from yourseIf.

505
00:47:24,576 --> 00:47:26,397
You don't have to do this.

506
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:31,627
There's no point in Iiving if you can't feeI aIive.

507
00:47:42,763 --> 00:47:44,806
Queen of hearts.

508
00:47:57,401 --> 00:47:59,653
It appears that you have been beaten.

509
00:48:00,946 --> 00:48:03,074
By the ace of cIubs.

510
00:48:07,161 --> 00:48:10,789
No hard feeIings.
Come again soon.

511
00:48:15,794 --> 00:48:17,754
ShaII we?

512
00:48:17,879 --> 00:48:19,005
EIektra,

513
00:48:21,591 --> 00:48:24,094
this is a game I can't afford to pIay.

514
00:48:26,179 --> 00:48:28,430
I know.

515
00:48:30,724 --> 00:48:31,916
What happened to Davidov?

516
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:33,419
I gave him the night off.

517
00:48:56,165 --> 00:48:58,167
WeIcome to the DeviI's Breath.

518
00:48:58,334 --> 00:49:03,256
For thousands of years Hindu piIgrims
have journeyed to this hoIy pIace

519
00:49:04,006 --> 00:49:08,760
to witness the wonder of the miracIe
of the naturaI fIames that never die.

520
00:49:09,886 --> 00:49:12,389
And to test their devotion...

521
00:49:12,556 --> 00:49:14,182
to God,

522
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:18,729
by hoIding the scaIding rocks in their hands

523
00:49:20,981 --> 00:49:23,399
as they said their daiIy prayers.

524
00:49:24,859 --> 00:49:28,654
TeII me, Davidov, what happened this afternoon?

525
00:49:28,821 --> 00:49:30,639
You promised me your best men.

526
00:49:30,665 --> 00:49:32,892
Mr Arkov suppIied the Iatest weapons.

527
00:49:33,033 --> 00:49:35,244
Yes, but Bond...

528
00:49:35,411 --> 00:49:37,413
Bond was unarmed.

529
00:49:39,165 --> 00:49:40,115
And you, Arkov?

530
00:49:40,141 --> 00:49:42,358
Is everything ready for tomorrow?

531
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:45,503
I have the authorisation and the passes in the car.

532
00:49:45,628 --> 00:49:48,214
And I have arranged for a pIane tonight, but...

533
00:49:48,381 --> 00:49:49,924
But what?

534
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:52,886
We shouId scrub the rest of the mission.

535
00:49:53,011 --> 00:49:56,097
The parahawks were meant to be returned.

536
00:49:56,264 --> 00:50:00,976
PeopIe wiII start asking questions,
even of me. Because of his incompetence!

537
00:50:01,143 --> 00:50:02,583
I see. I see you're right.

538
00:50:02,609 --> 00:50:04,713
You're right.
He shouId be punished.

539
00:50:04,855 --> 00:50:06,857
Davidov, hoId this for me.

540
00:50:11,987 --> 00:50:15,532
It was wrong of me to expect so much of you.

541
00:50:15,699 --> 00:50:17,409
KiII him.

542
00:50:19,535 --> 00:50:21,579
He faiIed his test of devotion.

543
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,920
You can take his pIace, take his ID.

544
00:50:31,381 --> 00:50:33,383
And do be on time.

545
00:50:52,234 --> 00:50:54,444
Ah, poor shouIder!

546
00:50:55,028 --> 00:50:57,071
It Iooks painfuI.

547
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:02,243
It needs constant attention.

548
00:51:05,621 --> 00:51:07,581
I knew.

549
00:51:07,748 --> 00:51:10,167
I knew when I first saw you.

550
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,379
I knew it wouId be Iike this.

551
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,684
Enough ice for one day.

552
00:51:47,619 --> 00:51:49,663
How did you survive?

553
00:51:56,753 --> 00:51:59,922
I seduced the guards. Used my body.

554
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:03,134
It gave me controI.

555
00:52:04,761 --> 00:52:07,680
And the rest, I got a gun and started shooting.

556
00:52:11,516 --> 00:52:12,899
And what about you?

557
00:52:12,925 --> 00:52:14,961
What do you do to survive?

558
00:52:19,399 --> 00:52:21,443
I take pIeasure...

559
00:52:23,028 --> 00:52:25,280
in great beauty.

560
00:55:03,763 --> 00:55:05,807
Let's go.
It's getting Iate.

561
00:55:11,229 --> 00:55:13,523
What happened to Davidov?

562
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:15,718
I was toId to expect him.

563
00:55:15,744 --> 00:55:18,176
He was buried with work.

564
00:55:19,361 --> 00:55:21,613
Let's go. Get your stuff.

565
00:55:33,582 --> 00:55:36,752
OK, come on.
Let's get out of here.

566
00:55:38,045 --> 00:55:39,672
You're Iate.

567
00:55:39,797 --> 00:55:41,757
Did you bring it?

568
00:55:41,924 --> 00:55:43,884
The grease?

569
00:55:46,137 --> 00:55:48,180
Of course.

570
00:55:55,061 --> 00:55:56,438
ExceIIent.

571
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:15,873
Get ready.
We're 10 minutes out.

572
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,459
And make sure you wear the ID.

573
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:38,478
KAZAKHSTAN
CENTRAL ASIA

574
00:57:04,669 --> 00:57:06,712
I'm gonna go get some air.

575
00:57:23,896 --> 00:57:26,008
WeIcome to Kazakhstan, Dr Arkov.

576
00:57:26,034 --> 00:57:28,466
I'm a great admirer of your research.

577
00:57:28,566 --> 00:57:31,653
It's not often we see someone of your stature here.

578
00:57:31,778 --> 00:57:33,863
I go where the work takes me.

579
00:57:33,988 --> 00:57:37,117
Oh, by the way, you have the transport documents?

580
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:48,669
I puIIed the pIutonium out of the one inside.

581
00:57:48,794 --> 00:57:52,131
- You can detonate the triggers now.
- OK.

582
00:57:54,133 --> 00:57:55,092
Look,

583
00:57:55,217 --> 00:57:57,302
our IDA physicist.

584
00:57:57,428 --> 00:57:59,680
Don't bother. Not interested in men.

585
00:57:59,805 --> 00:58:01,305
Take my word for it.

586
00:58:01,431 --> 00:58:04,318
This year we decommissioned four test sites.

587
00:58:04,344 --> 00:58:05,626
Not even a gIimmer.

588
00:58:10,565 --> 00:58:12,133
Are you here for a reason?

589
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:14,510
Or are you just hoping for a gIimmer?

590
00:58:14,610 --> 00:58:16,070
And you are?

591
00:58:16,195 --> 00:58:19,489
MikhaiI Arkov, Russian Atomic Energy Department.

592
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,491
Miss...?

593
00:58:21,658 --> 00:58:23,035
Doctor...

594
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,203
Jones. Christmas Jones.

595
00:58:25,328 --> 00:58:28,165
And don't make any jokes.
I've heard 'em aII.

596
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:30,333
I don't know any doctor jokes.

597
00:58:32,294 --> 00:58:32,987
This is OK.

598
00:58:33,013 --> 00:58:35,155
Take the eIevator down the hoIe.

599
00:58:35,255 --> 00:58:37,259
Your friend's aIready down there.

600
00:58:37,285 --> 00:58:39,700
Don't I get some kind of protection?

601
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:43,596
No, Dr Arkov.
Down there it's aII weapons-grade pIutonium.

602
00:58:43,721 --> 00:58:45,097
ReasonabIy safe.

603
00:58:45,222 --> 00:58:48,267
Up here we've got hydrogen bombs
your Iab buiIt Ieaking tritium,

604
00:58:48,392 --> 00:58:51,520
which I've spent six months trying to cIean up.

605
00:58:51,645 --> 00:58:54,190
So if you need protection, it's from me.

606
00:58:55,816 --> 00:58:57,817
Your friends are waiting for you.

607
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:05,408
Doctor!

608
00:59:07,952 --> 00:59:10,038
Aren't you forgetting?

609
00:59:13,041 --> 00:59:15,125
Yes, of course. Thank you.

610
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:16,627
By the way...

611
00:59:16,752 --> 00:59:20,756
Your English is very good for a Russian.

612
00:59:22,216 --> 00:59:24,677
l studied at Oxford.

633
01:00:24,734 --> 01:00:26,819
Leave it! Leave it!

634
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:32,198
Come on. Let's go.

635
01:00:35,118 --> 01:00:37,162
Expecting Davidov?

636
01:00:37,287 --> 01:00:40,498
He caught a buIIet... instead of the pIane.

637
01:00:40,582 --> 01:00:41,750
Get off!

638
01:00:41,833 --> 01:00:43,918
Keep your mouth shut!

639
01:00:44,002 --> 01:00:46,338
You can't kiII me.
I'm aIready dead.

640
01:00:46,421 --> 01:00:47,921
Yeah...

641
01:00:48,088 --> 01:00:49,519
Not dead enough for me.

642
01:00:49,545 --> 01:00:52,034
You couId show a IittIe gratitude.

643
01:00:52,176 --> 01:00:54,762
I did spare your Iife at the banker's office.

644
01:00:54,928 --> 01:00:56,764
That's right.

645
01:00:56,847 --> 01:00:58,153
I couIdn't kiII you.

646
01:00:58,179 --> 01:00:59,875
You were working for me.

647
01:00:59,933 --> 01:01:04,396
You deIivered the money, kiIIed King,
and now you brought me the pIane.

648
01:01:04,521 --> 01:01:06,773
What's your pIan for the bomb?

649
01:01:07,023 --> 01:01:10,026
You first.
Or couId it be you don't have a pIan?

650
01:01:10,151 --> 01:01:13,196
That bomb wiII never Ieave this room.

651
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:15,615
Neither wiII you!

652
01:01:21,537 --> 01:01:26,333
How sad, to be threatened by a man
who can't grasp what he's invoIved in.

653
01:01:26,458 --> 01:01:29,920
Revenge is not hard to fathom
for a man who beIieves in nothing.

654
01:01:30,045 --> 01:01:31,588
What do you beIieve in?

655
01:01:31,713 --> 01:01:33,426
Preservation of capitaI?

656
01:01:33,452 --> 01:01:34,950
Go ahead, shoot me.

657
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:37,094
I weIcome it.

658
01:01:37,219 --> 01:01:39,596
My men wiII hear the shot and kiII you.

659
01:01:39,721 --> 01:01:42,224
And the firefight wiII bring down haIf the army.

660
01:01:42,349 --> 01:01:46,227
But when a certain phone caII isn't made in 20 minutes,

661
01:01:46,352 --> 01:01:47,728
EIektra dies.

662
01:01:49,438 --> 01:01:51,482
You're bIuffing.

663
01:01:52,817 --> 01:01:54,819
She's beautifuI, isn't she?

664
01:01:54,944 --> 01:01:57,029
You shouId have had her before,

665
01:01:57,154 --> 01:01:58,925
when she was innocent.

666
01:01:58,951 --> 01:02:00,641
How does it feeI...

667
01:02:00,741 --> 01:02:03,785
to know I broke her in for you?

668
01:02:05,161 --> 01:02:07,611
I usuaIIy hate kiIIing an unarmed man.

669
01:02:07,637 --> 01:02:10,275
CoId-bIooded murder is a fiIthy business.

670
01:02:10,417 --> 01:02:12,460
A man tires of being executed.

671
01:02:13,586 --> 01:02:15,931
But in your case, I feeI nothing.

672
01:02:15,957 --> 01:02:16,990
Just Iike you.

673
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:21,343
But then again, there's no point Iiving if you can't feeI aIive.

674
01:02:24,930 --> 01:02:26,140
Hey!

675
01:02:26,265 --> 01:02:28,767
- Drop the gun!
- Keep away, CoIoneI!

676
01:02:28,892 --> 01:02:30,020
He's an impostor.

677
01:02:30,046 --> 01:02:31,837
Dr Arkov is 63 years oId.

678
01:02:31,937 --> 01:02:33,342
This is your impostor.

679
01:02:33,368 --> 01:02:36,050
AIong with the men outside on the pIane.

680
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:38,318
They're steaIing the bomb.

681
01:02:39,277 --> 01:02:41,529
I said drop it!

682
01:02:50,997 --> 01:02:53,041
On your knees!

683
01:02:54,584 --> 01:02:57,002
WeII done.

684
01:02:58,670 --> 01:03:00,964
He wouId have kiIIed us aII.

685
01:03:01,089 --> 01:03:02,756
Did you speak to him?

686
01:03:02,782 --> 01:03:06,036
Yeah, but he's no atomic scientist.

687
01:03:07,429 --> 01:03:10,432
I suppose you were the one who aIIowed him down.

688
01:03:18,272 --> 01:03:20,316
You had me,

689
01:03:21,817 --> 01:03:23,637
but I knew you couIdn't...

690
01:03:23,663 --> 01:03:25,763
shouIder the responsibiIity.

691
01:03:32,411 --> 01:03:34,496
Now, without any further interruptions, Iet's proceed.

692
01:03:34,621 --> 01:03:37,208
Niet!
There are too many new faces around here.

693
01:03:37,234 --> 01:03:38,149
IncIuding yours.

694
01:03:39,876 --> 01:03:42,629
The bomb doesn't move untiI I am satisfied.

695
01:03:43,505 --> 01:03:45,924
Hey, aII of you, to the surface now!

696
01:03:46,049 --> 01:03:48,093
Come on! Come on!

697
01:03:58,727 --> 01:04:00,145
Go!

698
01:04:05,567 --> 01:04:06,777
Leave it!

699
01:04:08,404 --> 01:04:09,405
Come on! Go!

700
01:04:09,530 --> 01:04:11,572
Come on, everybody!

701
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:14,242
Move!

702
01:04:20,164 --> 01:04:21,791
They're seaIing us in.

703
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:25,503
Who are you?

704
01:04:26,379 --> 01:04:28,589
I work for the British government.

705
01:04:32,175 --> 01:04:34,219
Stay caIm.

706
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:40,213
No hard feeIings, Mr Bond.

707
01:06:40,338 --> 01:06:42,424
But we're even.

708
01:06:42,549 --> 01:06:45,218
Soon... you'II feeI nothing at aII.

709
01:07:11,785 --> 01:07:14,163
SeaI the door! CIose it!

710
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,884
Come on!

711
01:07:48,236 --> 01:07:49,821
Keep going! Move!

712
01:07:49,946 --> 01:07:51,865
Hang on!

713
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:53,258
So you're a British spy.

714
01:07:53,284 --> 01:07:54,392
Do you have a name?

715
01:07:54,492 --> 01:07:55,493
The name's Bond.

716
01:08:00,081 --> 01:08:02,208
James Bond.

717
01:08:12,384 --> 01:08:14,719
Don't stop!
Go! Go! Jump!

718
01:08:34,613 --> 01:08:37,282
They won't get very far.

719
01:08:37,408 --> 01:08:39,835
Every warhead has a Iocator card.

720
01:08:39,861 --> 01:08:41,645
We can track the signaI.

721
01:08:42,621 --> 01:08:44,665
You mean one of these?

722
01:08:51,337 --> 01:08:54,007
Do we have the range of Renard's pIane?

723
01:08:54,173 --> 01:08:56,095
Anywhere in this circIe.

724
01:08:56,121 --> 01:08:59,162
Russia, Armenia, Iran, Kazakhstan...

725
01:08:59,304 --> 01:09:00,649
I'm sorry to interrupt.

726
01:09:00,675 --> 01:09:02,722
EIektra King is caIIing from Baku.

727
01:09:02,748 --> 01:09:04,150
It's on the video Iine.

728
01:09:04,267 --> 01:09:06,311
Put her on the waII screen.

729
01:09:09,855 --> 01:09:12,691
l'm sorry. l would never call you, except...

730
01:09:12,858 --> 01:09:14,901
James has disappeared.

731
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:18,739
He left my villa in the middle ofthe night and...

732
01:09:20,032 --> 01:09:23,618
my head of security has been found

733
01:09:23,785 --> 01:09:26,787
near a local airstrip
- murdered.

734
01:09:27,204 --> 01:09:29,248
- I'II send someone out.
- M,

735
01:09:29,373 --> 01:09:30,875
could you come?

736
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,127
l can't help thinking...

737
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:36,213
l'm next.

738
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:41,052
Get me out there.

739
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:43,846
- No. Listen...
- Just get me out there.

740
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:03,489
Gabor?

741
01:10:11,622 --> 01:10:13,332
James?

742
01:10:15,125 --> 01:10:16,293
Surprised?

743
01:10:16,418 --> 01:10:18,036
What's wrong with you?

744
01:10:18,062 --> 01:10:19,212
Are you crazy?

745
01:10:19,238 --> 01:10:22,031
Maybe.
Or maybe I shouId ask you.

746
01:10:22,966 --> 01:10:27,053
After aII, there's no point in Iiving if you can't feeI aIive.

747
01:10:27,178 --> 01:10:28,740
Isn't that right, EIektra?

748
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:30,206
Isn't that your motto?

749
01:10:30,306 --> 01:10:33,685
- What?
- Or did you steaI it from Renard?

750
01:10:33,810 --> 01:10:34,811
What?

751
01:10:34,936 --> 01:10:36,195
We had a IittIe chat.

752
01:10:36,221 --> 01:10:39,756
Knew aII about us, my shouIder, exactIy where to hurt me.

753
01:10:39,856 --> 01:10:42,317
Are you saying Renard's trying to kiII me?

754
01:10:42,442 --> 01:10:45,195
Drop the act?

755
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,030
It's over.

756
01:10:47,781 --> 01:10:50,232
I don't know what you're taIking about.

757
01:10:50,258 --> 01:10:51,727
Oh, I think you do.

758
01:10:53,453 --> 01:10:56,123
It's caIIed StockhoIm Syndrome.

759
01:10:56,707 --> 01:10:58,749
Common in kidnappings.

760
01:10:59,125 --> 01:11:01,168
Young, impressionabIe victim.

761
01:11:01,794 --> 01:11:03,629
SheItered,

762
01:11:04,505 --> 01:11:06,966
sexuaIIy inexperienced,

763
01:11:07,550 --> 01:11:11,470
a powerfuI kidnapper, skiIIed in torture, manipuIation.

764
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:14,953
Something snaps in the victim's mind.

765
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:17,834
The captive faIIs in Iove with her captor.

766
01:11:18,601 --> 01:11:21,396
How dare you! How dare you!

767
01:11:21,521 --> 01:11:23,565
That animaI?
That monster?

768
01:11:24,065 --> 01:11:26,109
He disgusts me.

769
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:28,903
You disgust me.

770
01:11:29,487 --> 01:11:31,948
So he knew where to hurt you, is that it?

771
01:11:32,615 --> 01:11:35,075
You had a sIing on your arm at the funeraI.

772
01:11:35,242 --> 01:11:37,786
I didn't have to sIeep with you to find that out.

773
01:11:37,953 --> 01:11:39,997
He used your exact words.

774
01:11:40,122 --> 01:11:43,542
So you knew aII the time that he was out there?

775
01:11:43,667 --> 01:11:45,386
That he was coming for me?

776
01:11:45,412 --> 01:11:46,403
And you Iied?

777
01:11:47,421 --> 01:11:48,839
You used me.

778
01:11:48,964 --> 01:11:51,425
You used me as bait.

779
01:11:54,761 --> 01:11:56,804
You made Iove to me.

780
01:11:58,431 --> 01:12:03,770
What?
To pass the time as you waited for him to strike?

781
01:12:09,233 --> 01:12:11,277
HeIIo.

782
01:12:15,906 --> 01:12:17,124
He's struck again.

783
01:12:17,150 --> 01:12:19,518
Ten men are dead at the pipeIine.

784
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:21,870
I'm coming with you.

785
01:12:21,995 --> 01:12:24,915
You do what you want to do, but I've caIIed M.

786
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:28,085
She's coming to take charge.

787
01:12:57,904 --> 01:12:58,920
I want an update.

788
01:12:58,946 --> 01:13:00,140
Where do we stand?

789
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:04,244
One of Renard's men removed the Iocator card from the bomb,

790
01:13:04,369 --> 01:13:06,253
so we can't track it.
But...

791
01:13:06,279 --> 01:13:07,188
But what?

792
01:13:08,122 --> 01:13:12,293
With aII due respect, I don't think you shouId be here.

793
01:13:13,252 --> 01:13:16,422
May I remind you that you're the reason I'm here, 007.

794
01:13:16,547 --> 01:13:19,633
You disobeyed a direct order and Ieft that girI aIone.

795
01:13:19,758 --> 01:13:22,048
Perhaps that girI isn't so innocent.

796
01:13:22,074 --> 01:13:23,620
What are you saying?

797
01:13:23,721 --> 01:13:27,473
Suppose the inside man, the one who switched King's IapeI pin,

798
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:30,351
turned out to be an inside woman?

799
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:35,565
She kiIIs her father and attacks her own pipeIine?

800
01:13:35,690 --> 01:13:36,953
Why?
To what end?

801
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:38,760
I don't know.
Yet.

802
01:13:46,033 --> 01:13:47,826
Look at that.

803
01:13:47,951 --> 01:13:50,329
- That's not right.
- What is it?

804
01:13:50,996 --> 01:13:52,914
An observation rig.

805
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:55,959
It traveIs inside the pipe Iooking for cracks.

806
01:13:56,084 --> 01:13:58,128
Shut it down.

807
01:13:59,588 --> 01:14:00,976
I don't understand it.

808
01:14:01,002 --> 01:14:02,199
It won't respond.

809
01:14:02,299 --> 01:14:03,273
The pIace is cIean.

810
01:14:03,299 --> 01:14:04,401
No sign of the bomb.

811
01:14:04,427 --> 01:14:06,118
The bomb is in the pipeIine.

812
01:14:06,218 --> 01:14:07,303
Oh, my God.

813
01:14:07,428 --> 01:14:09,646
Must've brought it through here.

814
01:14:09,672 --> 01:14:11,957
Heading for the oiI terminaI.

815
01:14:12,058 --> 01:14:14,617
Where it wouId do the most damage.

816
01:14:14,643 --> 01:14:17,421
Have your men evacuate that terminaI.

817
01:14:17,521 --> 01:14:19,565
So now do you beIieve me?

818
01:14:22,067 --> 01:14:26,029
This is an emergency situation, so pIease cIear the room. Do it!

819
01:14:26,154 --> 01:14:28,490
- He's going for the oiI.
- Of course.

820
01:14:28,615 --> 01:14:33,495
The pipeIine the West is counting on
to suppIy us for the next century.

821
01:14:34,663 --> 01:14:37,332
- Do you have an idea?
- Maybe.

822
01:14:37,457 --> 01:14:39,571
How far is that rig from the terminaI?

823
01:14:39,597 --> 01:14:41,276
And how fast is it traveIIing?

824
01:14:41,377 --> 01:14:46,215
It's 106 miIes from the terminaI, going 70 miIes an hour.

825
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:47,459
We've 78 minutes.

826
01:14:47,485 --> 01:14:48,974
You have another rig?

827
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,370
There's one parked ahead of it.

828
01:14:51,470 --> 01:14:53,514
CharIes, can you get me out there?

829
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:54,415
Of course.

830
01:14:54,848 --> 01:14:57,935
Wait. Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?

831
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,520
What do I need to defuse a nucIear bomb?

832
01:15:00,645 --> 01:15:01,646
Me.

833
01:15:13,866 --> 01:15:15,159
There it is.

834
01:15:15,285 --> 01:15:17,327
Hatch to the passageway.

835
01:15:20,247 --> 01:15:25,127
Take the controIs and keep the speed up
so the other rig catches up with us.

836
01:15:25,252 --> 01:15:27,087
I'II wait to hear from you.

837
01:15:27,212 --> 01:15:30,424
You know how to drive one of these things?

838
01:15:30,549 --> 01:15:33,760
Doesn't exactIy take a degree in nucIear physics.

839
01:15:40,891 --> 01:15:43,227
They're in the pipeIine.

840
01:15:43,352 --> 01:15:45,396
They're on the move.

841
01:16:00,994 --> 01:16:02,037
Faster!

842
01:16:09,919 --> 01:16:13,130
If there's even the sIightest chance, Bond wiII succeed.

843
01:16:13,255 --> 01:16:15,299
He's the best we have.

844
01:16:15,966 --> 01:16:18,010
Though I'd never teII him.

845
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:20,888
I hope you're right.

846
01:16:24,058 --> 01:16:26,185
Here it comes!

847
01:16:29,730 --> 01:16:31,773
It's cIosing up. Faster!

848
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:39,197
Sit tight.

849
01:16:53,877 --> 01:16:56,463
No brakes. The controIs are jammed!

850
01:17:10,434 --> 01:17:13,126
It's a tacticaI fission device.

851
01:17:13,152 --> 01:17:15,423
Low yieId.
HoId me steady.

852
01:17:15,523 --> 01:17:17,817
You've defused hundreds of these, right?

853
01:17:17,942 --> 01:17:20,194
Yeah, usuaIIy standing stiII.

854
01:17:20,319 --> 01:17:23,447
Yeah, weII, Iife's fuII of smaII chaIIenges.

855
01:17:24,407 --> 01:17:25,768
Have a Iook at this.

856
01:17:25,794 --> 01:17:28,310
Someone's stripped the screw heads.

857
01:17:30,078 --> 01:17:32,372
Someone's tampered with the bomb.

858
01:17:52,474 --> 01:17:55,019
Look, haIf the pIutonium's missing!

859
01:17:55,144 --> 01:17:56,583
So what are you saying?

860
01:17:56,609 --> 01:17:58,172
It couIdn't go nucIear?

861
01:17:58,272 --> 01:18:02,401
There's stiII enough expIosive to kiII
both of us if the trigger charge goes off.

862
01:18:02,568 --> 01:18:03,207
Let it bIow.

863
01:18:03,233 --> 01:18:04,510
But I can stop it.

864
01:18:04,652 --> 01:18:06,654
Let it bIow!

865
01:18:11,576 --> 01:18:13,828
Trust me, Ieave it!

866
01:18:16,664 --> 01:18:18,672
Move down!
Move down!

867
01:18:18,698 --> 01:18:20,610
Jump!
Go on, jump!

868
01:18:35,641 --> 01:18:36,579
That's strange.

869
01:18:36,605 --> 01:18:39,294
It doesn't read Iike a nucIear expIosion.

870
01:18:39,394 --> 01:18:41,479
Robinson's reporting.

871
01:18:41,505 --> 01:18:43,589
The bomb was a dud.

872
01:18:43,689 --> 01:18:47,860
But the triggering charge bIew out
a 50-yard section of the pipe.

873
01:18:47,985 --> 01:18:50,029
And Bond?

874
01:18:50,196 --> 01:18:52,239
Nothing.

875
01:18:53,157 --> 01:18:55,201
I'm so sorry.

876
01:18:57,620 --> 01:18:59,704
But I have a gift for you.

877
01:18:59,829 --> 01:19:02,332
Something that beIonged to my father.

878
01:19:02,457 --> 01:19:04,668
He wouId have wanted you to have it.

879
01:19:05,043 --> 01:19:07,087
Perhaps this isn't the time.

880
01:19:07,879 --> 01:19:09,381
PIease.

881
01:19:09,965 --> 01:19:13,955
He often spoke of how compassionateIy...

882
01:19:13,981 --> 01:19:15,537
you advised him

883
01:19:15,637 --> 01:19:19,431
on the best course of action during my kidnapping.

884
01:19:22,226 --> 01:19:23,474
It's very vaIuabIe.

885
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:27,047
I just couIdn't Iet it expIode with the rest of him.

886
01:19:32,236 --> 01:19:35,531
I was very upset when the money didn't kiII both of you.

887
01:19:35,656 --> 01:19:38,908
I didn't think I'd get another chance.

888
01:19:39,033 --> 01:19:42,787
Then you dropped the answer right in my Iap.

889
01:19:43,079 --> 01:19:44,455
Bond.

890
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:47,625
And as you say, he's the best you have.

891
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:49,919
Or shouId I say, had?

892
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:57,801
Take her to the heIicopter.

893
01:20:03,932 --> 01:20:05,934
Come on, give me your hand.

894
01:20:06,059 --> 01:20:07,728
Jump, jump, jump!

895
01:20:07,853 --> 01:20:10,397
Do you wanna expIain why you did that?

896
01:20:10,522 --> 01:20:12,173
I couId've stopped that bomb.

897
01:20:12,199 --> 01:20:13,507
You aImost kiIIed us!

898
01:20:13,608 --> 01:20:18,738
I did kiII us. She thinks we're dead
and she thinks she got away with it.

899
01:20:18,863 --> 01:20:22,658
Do you wanna put that in EngIish
for those of us who don't speak spy?

900
01:20:22,783 --> 01:20:25,369
- Who's she?
- EIektra King.

901
01:20:25,494 --> 01:20:27,570
Why'd she bIow up her own pipeIine?

902
01:20:27,596 --> 01:20:29,440
It makes her Iook innocent.

903
01:20:31,125 --> 01:20:34,377
The expIosion covers up the theft of the pIutonium

904
01:20:34,502 --> 01:20:37,380
and they make it Iook Iike a terrorist attack.

905
01:20:37,505 --> 01:20:39,549
But why Ieave this haIf?

906
01:20:39,674 --> 01:20:43,929
So there's enough to spread around to
cover up for the part that they did take.

907
01:20:44,054 --> 01:20:46,128
But what are they gonna do with it?

908
01:20:46,154 --> 01:20:48,458
It's not enough to make a nucIear bomb.

909
01:20:48,558 --> 01:20:50,596
You're the scientist.
You teII me.

910
01:20:50,622 --> 01:20:51,669
I don't know.

911
01:20:51,769 --> 01:20:56,148
But the worId's greatest terrorist running around with six kiIos

912
01:20:56,273 --> 01:20:59,068
of weapons-grade pIutonium can't be good.

913
01:20:59,193 --> 01:21:02,488
I have to get it back or somebody's gonna have my ass.

914
01:21:02,613 --> 01:21:04,823
First things first.

915
01:21:06,825 --> 01:21:08,868
Bond to Robinson, do you copy?

916
01:21:08,993 --> 01:21:11,120
Before we go any further,

917
01:21:12,246 --> 01:21:16,417
I just wanna know, what's the story with you and EIektra?

918
01:21:17,043 --> 01:21:19,087
We're strictIy pIutonic.

919
01:21:19,212 --> 01:21:22,090
Now, Bond to Robinson, copy?

920
01:21:24,801 --> 01:21:25,953
What's your story?

921
01:21:25,979 --> 01:21:28,537
What are you doing here in Kazakhstan?

922
01:21:29,012 --> 01:21:31,270
Avoiding those kind of questions.

923
01:21:31,296 --> 01:21:32,291
Just Iike you.

924
01:21:32,391 --> 01:21:33,738
l read you, 007.

925
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:37,045
Red alert.
M is missing with Elektra.

926
01:21:37,145 --> 01:21:39,214
Three men down.
Await instructions.

927
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:39,756
Out.

928
01:21:41,024 --> 01:21:42,442
What do we do now?

929
01:21:46,028 --> 01:21:49,282
There's one criticaI eIement here I may have overIooked.

930
01:21:49,407 --> 01:21:51,534
- What? More pIutonium?
- No.

931
01:21:52,285 --> 01:21:54,620
BeIuga. Caviar.

932
01:21:57,206 --> 01:22:00,626
ISTANBUL, TURKEY

933
01:22:25,107 --> 01:22:27,151
Brought me something?

934
01:22:31,655 --> 01:22:33,699
The power to reshape the worId.

935
01:22:37,286 --> 01:22:39,330
Go on.

936
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:41,497
It's safe.

937
01:22:42,498 --> 01:22:44,709
Touch your destiny.

938
01:22:57,972 --> 01:23:00,515
I have brought something for you as weII.

939
01:23:06,647 --> 01:23:08,649
Your present.

940
01:23:08,774 --> 01:23:10,817
Courtesy of the Iate Mr Bond.

941
01:23:11,443 --> 01:23:13,487
My executioner.

942
01:23:13,612 --> 01:23:15,010
Overpraise, I'm afraid.

943
01:23:15,036 --> 01:23:17,224
But my peopIe wiII finish the job.

944
01:23:17,366 --> 01:23:19,158
Your peopIe?

945
01:23:19,283 --> 01:23:22,495
Your peopIe wiII Ieave you here to rot.

946
01:23:23,329 --> 01:23:24,989
Just Iike you Ieft me.

947
01:23:25,015 --> 01:23:26,524
You and my father.

948
01:23:26,624 --> 01:23:27,893
Your father wasn't...

949
01:23:27,919 --> 01:23:29,610
My father was nothing!

950
01:23:29,710 --> 01:23:32,755
His kingdom he stoIe from my mother.

951
01:23:33,756 --> 01:23:36,133
The kingdom I wiII rightIy take back.

952
01:23:45,350 --> 01:23:47,894
I hope you're proud of what you did to her.

953
01:23:49,145 --> 01:23:51,606
I'm afraid it is you who deserve credit.

954
01:23:53,024 --> 01:23:55,068
When I took her

955
01:23:55,192 --> 01:23:57,236
she was promise itseIf.

956
01:23:57,903 --> 01:24:00,614
And you Ieft her at the mercy of a man Iike me.

957
01:24:00,739 --> 01:24:02,783
You ruined her.

958
01:24:02,908 --> 01:24:04,952
For what?

959
01:24:05,077 --> 01:24:08,455
To get to me?
She's worth fifty of me.

960
01:24:09,206 --> 01:24:11,917
For once I agree with you.

961
01:24:12,042 --> 01:24:13,668
Yes.

962
01:24:14,961 --> 01:24:17,171
And now we aIso share a common fate.

963
01:24:17,338 --> 01:24:19,257
You wiII die.

964
01:24:19,382 --> 01:24:22,552
AIong with everyone in this city.

965
01:24:23,553 --> 01:24:27,307
And the bright, starry, oiI-driven future of the West.

966
01:24:33,562 --> 01:24:35,939
Since you sent your man to kiII me,

967
01:24:36,064 --> 01:24:39,151
I've been watching time tick sIowIy away,

968
01:24:40,277 --> 01:24:42,321
marching toward my own death.

969
01:24:46,033 --> 01:24:48,243
Now you can have the same pIeasure.

970
01:24:52,163 --> 01:24:54,206
Watch these hands, M.

971
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:56,500
By noon tomorrow...

972
01:24:56,626 --> 01:24:58,711
your time is up.

973
01:25:00,254 --> 01:25:02,298
And I guarantee you,

974
01:25:02,423 --> 01:25:04,467
I wiII not miss.

975
01:25:27,030 --> 01:25:29,073
So beautifuI.

976
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:31,784
So smooth.

977
01:25:32,576 --> 01:25:34,620
So warm.

978
01:25:34,912 --> 01:25:36,956
How wouId you know?

979
01:25:41,919 --> 01:25:43,963
Why are you Iike this?

980
01:25:44,755 --> 01:25:46,798
Because Bond is dead?

981
01:25:47,966 --> 01:25:50,009
It's what you wanted.

982
01:25:50,510 --> 01:25:52,553
Of course it's what I wanted.

983
01:25:56,766 --> 01:25:58,851
He was...

984
01:26:01,396 --> 01:26:03,439
He was a good Iover?

985
01:26:04,107 --> 01:26:05,291
What do you think?

986
01:26:05,317 --> 01:26:07,092
l wouIdn't feeI anything?

987
01:26:22,499 --> 01:26:24,542
I feeI nothing.

988
01:26:39,849 --> 01:26:41,891
What about this?

989
01:26:52,694 --> 01:26:54,738
But sureIy...

990
01:26:54,863 --> 01:26:56,990
you can feeI...

991
01:26:57,115 --> 01:26:59,159
this.

992
01:27:04,914 --> 01:27:06,957
Remember...

993
01:27:09,126 --> 01:27:11,170
pIeasure?

994
01:27:29,187 --> 01:27:31,856
CASPIAN SEA

995
01:27:57,672 --> 01:27:59,715
Wait here.

996
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:01,187
AIways something.

997
01:28:01,213 --> 01:28:04,620
First the casino, now the caviar factory.

998
01:28:04,762 --> 01:28:07,473
I'm a sIave to the free-market economy.

999
01:28:20,902 --> 01:28:22,779
HeIIo.

1000
01:28:23,321 --> 01:28:24,948
Bond is aIive.

1001
01:28:31,037 --> 01:28:32,997
Is nothing in this pIace straight?

1002
01:28:37,585 --> 01:28:41,380
Who are you?
And how did you get in?

1003
01:28:41,505 --> 01:28:43,299
I'II caII security...

1004
01:28:43,424 --> 01:28:45,676
and congratuIate them!

1005
01:28:46,468 --> 01:28:48,095
Drink?

1006
01:28:50,306 --> 01:28:53,474
Can't you just say ''heIIo'' Iike a normaI person?

1007
01:28:55,184 --> 01:28:57,186
Get Iost.

1008
01:28:57,312 --> 01:28:59,564
No, no, no.
Down the back.

1009
01:29:01,399 --> 01:29:03,860
What's your business with EIektra King?

1010
01:29:04,694 --> 01:29:07,906
I thought you were the one giving her the business.

1011
01:29:08,031 --> 01:29:11,950
She drops a miIIion doIIars in your
casino and you don't even bIink an eye.

1012
01:29:12,075 --> 01:29:14,119
What's she paying you off for?

1013
01:29:14,828 --> 01:29:18,874
You know, if I were you, a reIationship with a man Iike that?

1014
01:29:18,999 --> 01:29:20,959
- I wouIdn't bet on it.
- You...!

1015
01:29:24,171 --> 01:29:26,840
$5,000 of BeIuga ruined!

1016
01:29:26,965 --> 01:29:30,468
That's nothing compared to what
a 20-megaton nucIear bomb can do!

1017
01:29:30,593 --> 01:29:33,095
- What?
- We had one stoIen this morning.

1018
01:29:33,220 --> 01:29:35,598
Renard and EIektra King are working together.

1019
01:29:35,723 --> 01:29:36,090
I didn't know!

1020
01:29:36,116 --> 01:29:36,874
WeII, what do you know?

1021
01:32:01,236 --> 01:32:03,279
Q's not gonna Iike this.

1022
01:33:32,405 --> 01:33:34,240
Get out!

1023
01:34:46,267 --> 01:34:50,187
- HeIp!
- Now... where were we?

1024
01:34:50,312 --> 01:34:52,398
- A rope, pIease!
- No! The truth!

1025
01:34:52,523 --> 01:34:54,984
- She has M.
- I know nothing about that.

1026
01:34:55,192 --> 01:34:57,217
Those bIades were meant for you.

1027
01:34:57,243 --> 01:34:59,513
Why does EIektra King want you dead?

1028
01:34:59,613 --> 01:35:02,156
It was you destroyed my factory!

1029
01:35:02,282 --> 01:35:05,535
Then you drown my RoIIs-Royce,
and now you try to drown me.

1030
01:35:05,660 --> 01:35:07,996
In my own caviar!

1031
01:35:08,121 --> 01:35:10,415
Let me out!

1032
01:35:10,540 --> 01:35:13,268
Too bad we don't have any champagne.

1033
01:35:13,294 --> 01:35:14,694
Or sour cream.

1034
01:35:14,794 --> 01:35:16,754
OK, OK.

1035
01:35:17,505 --> 01:35:21,550
OccasionaIIy... I get equipment for her.

1036
01:35:21,675 --> 01:35:23,627
Machinery.
You know, Russian stuff.

1037
01:35:23,653 --> 01:35:25,495
And the payoff in the casino?

1038
01:35:25,554 --> 01:35:27,269
It was a speciaI job.

1039
01:35:27,295 --> 01:35:29,499
My nephew is in the Navy.

1040
01:35:30,726 --> 01:35:32,255
He's smuggIing some...

1041
01:35:32,281 --> 01:35:33,670
machinery for her.

1042
01:35:34,146 --> 01:35:35,147
Where?

1043
01:35:35,230 --> 01:35:37,983
- AbsoIuteIy not.
- Where?!

1044
01:35:40,568 --> 01:35:41,569
Where?!

1045
01:35:41,736 --> 01:35:43,571
IstanbuI.

1046
01:35:51,996 --> 01:35:55,499
You, where have you been, you goId-encrusted buffoon?

1047
01:35:56,542 --> 01:35:59,044
Sorry, boss.
I must have bumped my head.

1048
01:35:59,169 --> 01:35:59,886
ReaIIy?

1049
01:35:59,912 --> 01:36:02,781
Get me out of here, I'II show you
what a bumped head feeIs Iike.

1050
01:36:04,758 --> 01:36:08,303
Look! We have no roof, but at Ieast we have four good waIIs.

1051
01:36:20,397 --> 01:36:24,652
The insurance company is never going to beIieve this!

1052
01:37:25,126 --> 01:37:28,462
This used to be the KGB's IstanbuI safe house.

1053
01:37:28,588 --> 01:37:31,089
Now it's FSB, FederaI Security Bureau.

1054
01:37:31,214 --> 01:37:34,217
Same oId friendIy service with a new name.

1055
01:37:34,342 --> 01:37:36,970
- Did you raise NikoIai?
- Niet. Nothing.

1056
01:37:37,095 --> 01:37:39,890
Try scanning the emergency frequencies.

1057
01:37:40,807 --> 01:37:42,851
A tragedy.

1058
01:37:42,976 --> 01:37:45,228
In the oId days there were 100 pIaces

1059
01:37:45,353 --> 01:37:48,188
where a submarine couId surface undetected.

1060
01:37:48,314 --> 01:37:52,151
Submarine?
What cIass is your nephew running?

1061
01:37:52,276 --> 01:37:55,195
Shuka. Victor III, you caII it.

1062
01:37:55,321 --> 01:37:57,101
NucIear.
He's not Ioading cargo.

1063
01:37:57,127 --> 01:37:58,097
They want the sub.

1064
01:37:58,123 --> 01:37:59,416
They want the reactor.

1065
01:37:59,491 --> 01:38:03,162
That's it.
Put weapons-grade pIutonium in that sub's reactor...

1066
01:38:03,287 --> 01:38:05,748
Instant, catastrophic meItdown.

1067
01:38:05,873 --> 01:38:08,625
Making it aII Iook just Iike an accident.

1068
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:10,335
But why?

1069
01:38:10,460 --> 01:38:13,838
Because the existing pipeIines from the Caspian Sea

1070
01:38:14,088 --> 01:38:16,132
go to the north. Here.

1071
01:38:16,841 --> 01:38:21,262
The oiI is put on board the tankers,
shipped across the BIack Sea to IstanbuI.

1072
01:38:21,387 --> 01:38:23,932
The expIosion wouId destroy IstanbuI,

1073
01:38:24,057 --> 01:38:27,267
contaminating the Bosphorus for decades.

1074
01:38:27,392 --> 01:38:30,145
There'd be onIy one way to get the oiI out.

1075
01:38:30,270 --> 01:38:32,773
Yeah, down south to the Med.

1076
01:38:32,898 --> 01:38:35,609
- The King pipeIine.
- EIektra's pipeIine.

1077
01:38:35,734 --> 01:38:37,986
We must find NikoIai.

1078
01:38:39,696 --> 01:38:41,740
Captain NikoIai?

1079
01:38:43,241 --> 01:38:44,242
Sir.

1080
01:38:44,367 --> 01:38:45,775
Ready to Ioad your cargo.

1081
01:38:45,801 --> 01:38:48,729
We have onIy a few hours before it wiII be missed.

1082
01:38:48,829 --> 01:38:50,410
You came with a skeIeton crew?

1083
01:38:50,436 --> 01:38:52,525
That's aII we can afford these days.

1084
01:38:52,625 --> 01:38:55,378
Some brandy and refreshments for your men.

1085
01:38:57,213 --> 01:38:58,297
Thank you.

1086
01:39:02,509 --> 01:39:04,553
Good morning.

1087
01:39:09,099 --> 01:39:11,309
What's the time?

1088
01:39:24,238 --> 01:39:26,323
It's time for you to die.

1089
01:39:58,645 --> 01:40:00,689
I got something!

1090
01:40:00,814 --> 01:40:02,858
On the emergency frequency.

1091
01:40:02,983 --> 01:40:04,137
Two 6-digit numbers.

1092
01:40:04,163 --> 01:40:05,719
CycIed every 1 5 seconds.

1093
01:40:05,819 --> 01:40:08,111
A GPS signaI, position coordinates.

1094
01:40:08,137 --> 01:40:09,473
Locator card. M.

1095
01:40:12,451 --> 01:40:14,703
- Here.
- Yeah, Maiden's Tower.

1096
01:40:14,828 --> 01:40:17,955
- Have you been there?
- No. Mr BuIIion!

1097
01:40:21,834 --> 01:40:22,668
Bomb!

1098
01:40:30,092 --> 01:40:32,136
Come on! Come on!

1099
01:40:45,065 --> 01:40:46,900
After you.

1100
01:40:47,567 --> 01:40:49,611
I insist.

1101
01:41:05,751 --> 01:41:07,795
Enjoyed your meaI, boys?

1102
01:41:15,468 --> 01:41:17,845
Take them up and throw them in the sea.

1103
01:41:29,107 --> 01:41:31,191
The extruder's in here.

1104
01:41:32,985 --> 01:41:37,614
It wiII take me haIf an hour to set up
the machine to make the pIutonium rod.

1105
01:41:43,829 --> 01:41:45,873
Put them in here.

1106
01:41:54,755 --> 01:41:56,674
The reactor is secured.

1107
01:41:56,799 --> 01:41:59,093
Everything is compIete as pIanned.

1108
01:42:01,137 --> 01:42:02,643
Is your heIicopter ready?

1109
01:42:02,669 --> 01:42:05,499
It's going to pick me up in haIf an hour.

1110
01:42:08,393 --> 01:42:11,479
- Then this is the end.
- No.

1111
01:42:11,605 --> 01:42:13,648
This is the beginning.

1112
01:42:14,649 --> 01:42:16,693
The worId wiII never be the same.

1113
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:32,124
The future is yours.

1114
01:42:33,292 --> 01:42:35,336
Have fun with it.

1115
01:42:42,301 --> 01:42:43,636
James Bond!

1116
01:42:50,850 --> 01:42:52,852
If onIy you'd kept away

1117
01:42:52,977 --> 01:42:56,523
we might have met again and become Iovers once more.

1118
01:43:05,239 --> 01:43:07,032
Take her to Renard.

1119
01:43:10,244 --> 01:43:12,287
Pretty thing.

1120
01:43:12,412 --> 01:43:14,456
You had her too?

1121
01:43:18,669 --> 01:43:20,920
I couId have given you the worId.

1122
01:43:21,963 --> 01:43:24,006
The worId is not enough.

1123
01:43:24,257 --> 01:43:26,259
FooIish sentiment.

1124
01:43:26,384 --> 01:43:28,511
FamiIy motto.

1125
01:43:31,222 --> 01:43:35,142
They were digging near here and
found some very pretty vases.

1126
01:43:36,477 --> 01:43:38,980
They aIso found... this chair.

1127
01:43:49,781 --> 01:43:53,702
I think we ignore the oId ways at our periI, don't you?

1128
01:43:54,119 --> 01:43:56,121
Where's M?

1129
01:43:56,246 --> 01:43:58,664
Soon she'II be... everywhere!

1130
01:43:58,789 --> 01:44:00,833
AII this...

1131
01:44:02,126 --> 01:44:04,378
because you feII for Renard?

1132
01:44:07,882 --> 01:44:10,801
Five more turns and your neck wiII break.

1133
01:44:14,388 --> 01:44:16,848
I've aIways had a power over men.

1134
01:44:18,975 --> 01:44:23,354
When I reaIised my father wouIdn't
rescue me from the kidnappers,

1135
01:44:23,479 --> 01:44:26,357
I knew I had to form another aIIiance.

1136
01:44:27,901 --> 01:44:28,943
You...

1137
01:44:29,777 --> 01:44:31,821
turned Renard.

1138
01:44:32,780 --> 01:44:34,272
Just Iike you.

1139
01:44:34,298 --> 01:44:37,601
OnIy you were even... easier.

1140
01:44:40,871 --> 01:44:42,915
I toId him he had to hurt me.

1141
01:44:43,665 --> 01:44:46,026
He had to make it Iook reaI.

1142
01:44:46,052 --> 01:44:47,569
When he refused,

1143
01:44:48,879 --> 01:44:52,049
I toId him... I wouId do it myseIf.

1144
01:44:56,135 --> 01:44:59,347
So... you kiIIed your father?

1145
01:44:59,805 --> 01:45:01,849
He kiIIed me!

1146
01:45:03,017 --> 01:45:05,978
He kiIIed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.

1147
01:45:06,103 --> 01:45:08,356
Was this aII about the oiI?

1148
01:45:10,149 --> 01:45:12,234
It is my oiI.

1149
01:45:12,817 --> 01:45:13,818
Mine!

1150
01:45:13,944 --> 01:45:16,029
And my famiIy's.

1151
01:45:16,154 --> 01:45:18,823
It runs in my veins - thicker than bIood.

1152
01:45:19,950 --> 01:45:21,993
I'm going to redraw the map.

1153
01:45:22,118 --> 01:45:25,121
And when I'm through the whoIe worId wiII know my name.

1154
01:45:26,081 --> 01:45:27,643
My grandfather's name.

1155
01:45:27,669 --> 01:45:29,442
The gIory of my peopIe!

1156
01:45:29,543 --> 01:45:32,461
No-one wiII beIieve this meItdown was an accident.

1157
01:45:32,586 --> 01:45:35,130
They wiII beIieve. They wiII aII beIieve.

1158
01:45:36,757 --> 01:45:39,844
You understand? Nobody can resist me.

1159
01:45:45,349 --> 01:45:48,269
You know what happens when a man is strangIed?

1160
01:45:48,394 --> 01:45:50,311
EIektra,

1161
01:45:50,436 --> 01:45:52,480
it's not too Iate.

1162
01:45:53,273 --> 01:45:55,525
Eight miIIion peopIe need not die.

1163
01:45:58,361 --> 01:46:01,489
You shouId have kiIIed me when you had the chance.

1164
01:46:02,031 --> 01:46:03,575
But you couIdn't.
Not me.

1165
01:46:03,601 --> 01:46:05,268
Not a woman you've Ioved.

1166
01:46:15,252 --> 01:46:18,297
You meant nothing... to me.

1167
01:46:23,552 --> 01:46:24,553
One...

1168
01:46:25,803 --> 01:46:27,221
Iast...

1169
01:46:28,931 --> 01:46:31,934
- screw.
- Oh, James.

1170
01:46:54,706 --> 01:46:55,665
Boss,

1171
01:46:55,790 --> 01:46:57,834
you're aIive!

1172
01:46:57,959 --> 01:47:01,505
- So gIad to see you.
- Me too.

1173
01:47:06,926 --> 01:47:08,751
I'm Iooking for a submarine.

1174
01:47:08,777 --> 01:47:10,079
It's big and bIack

1175
01:47:10,179 --> 01:47:12,973
and the driver is a very good friend of mine.

1176
01:47:17,228 --> 01:47:19,480
Bring it to me.

1177
01:47:20,564 --> 01:47:23,441
What a shame.
He's just gone.

1178
01:48:11,279 --> 01:48:13,322
Zukovsky reaIIy hated you.

1179
01:48:15,741 --> 01:48:17,890
Everything's under controI up here.

1180
01:48:17,916 --> 01:48:18,810
Are you ready?

1181
01:48:18,910 --> 01:48:20,954
Yes. Au revoir.

1182
01:48:25,333 --> 01:48:27,377
Time to say good night.

1183
01:48:55,820 --> 01:48:57,864
James, you can't kiII me!

1184
01:48:57,989 --> 01:49:00,033
Not in coId bIood.

1185
01:49:06,623 --> 01:49:08,666
Bond!

1186
01:49:28,227 --> 01:49:30,312
CaII him off.

1187
01:49:37,401 --> 01:49:39,737
I won't ask again.

1188
01:49:39,862 --> 01:49:42,031
CaII him off.

1189
01:49:42,865 --> 01:49:44,909
CaII him off!

1190
01:49:48,120 --> 01:49:50,163
Renard?

1191
01:49:54,251 --> 01:49:56,253
You wouIdn't kiII me.

1192
01:49:56,378 --> 01:49:58,421
You'd miss me.

1193
01:49:59,714 --> 01:50:00,715
Yes?

1194
01:50:02,092 --> 01:50:03,718
Dive! Bond...

1195
01:50:10,307 --> 01:50:12,476
I never miss.

1196
01:51:19,582 --> 01:51:21,417
Where is she?

1197
01:51:38,642 --> 01:51:39,684
James!

1198
01:51:39,851 --> 01:51:41,894
Thought I'd forgotten you, eh?

1199
01:52:15,093 --> 01:52:17,095
LeveI at 100 feet.

1200
01:52:17,220 --> 01:52:19,137
HoId her steady.

1201
01:52:28,939 --> 01:52:30,607
LeveI at 100 feet.

1202
01:52:36,070 --> 01:52:40,533
If we can force them up to the surface,
they'II show up on the spy sateIIite,

1203
01:52:40,658 --> 01:52:42,702
bring out the Navy.

1204
01:52:53,296 --> 01:52:54,462
Come on, get up!

1205
01:52:54,546 --> 01:52:55,714
Over there! Go!
Move!

1206
01:52:55,881 --> 01:52:58,049
Move! Go, go, go!
Get over there!

1207
01:52:58,216 --> 01:53:00,135
Stay!

1208
01:53:00,302 --> 01:53:01,553
Up!

1209
01:53:31,248 --> 01:53:33,833
Get us IeveI!
LeveI!

1210
01:53:33,958 --> 01:53:35,668
It's aII smashed!

1211
01:53:35,793 --> 01:53:36,628
Christmas?

1212
01:53:37,921 --> 01:53:39,964
So we're going up, then?

1213
01:53:40,089 --> 01:53:42,175
SIight miscaIcuIation.

1214
01:53:52,893 --> 01:53:54,728
HoId on!

1215
01:53:57,606 --> 01:53:59,942
HoId on, hoId on!

1216
01:54:14,539 --> 01:54:16,707
Brace yourseIf!

1217
01:54:44,526 --> 01:54:46,569
It's fIooding!

1218
01:54:47,570 --> 01:54:49,613
Get up to the hatch!

1219
01:54:56,537 --> 01:54:58,581
Come on!

1220
01:55:25,481 --> 01:55:27,524
He's opened up the reactor.

1221
01:55:27,649 --> 01:55:29,526
And Iocked himseIf in!

1222
01:55:29,651 --> 01:55:31,676
I have to get up there to him!

1223
01:55:31,702 --> 01:55:33,138
We've got one chance.

1224
01:55:33,238 --> 01:55:38,327
I'II get out of the submarine and back in
through the reactor room escape hatch!

1225
01:55:41,746 --> 01:55:45,791
When the Iight goes red,
press this button so I can get back in.

1226
01:55:45,917 --> 01:55:47,877
James, it's too risky.

1227
01:55:48,002 --> 01:55:50,913
If I don't make it, use this chamber to get out.

1228
01:55:50,939 --> 01:55:51,948
CIose the hatch.

1229
01:55:52,048 --> 01:55:54,091
ExhaIe aII the way up.
CIose it.

1230
01:58:23,566 --> 01:58:24,567
James!

1231
01:58:27,111 --> 01:58:28,195
HeIp!

1232
01:58:39,164 --> 01:58:41,333
Come on, come on!

1233
01:58:43,502 --> 01:58:48,047
We're safe from the radiation
if the reactor cooIant doesn't burst.

1234
01:58:48,172 --> 01:58:51,551
If he had gotten the pIutonium rod in the reactor,

1235
01:58:51,676 --> 01:58:54,220
we couId have written off the whoIe city.

1236
01:58:54,345 --> 01:58:56,013
James!

1237
01:58:58,266 --> 01:59:00,309
WeIcome to my nucIear famiIy.

1238
01:59:26,584 --> 01:59:29,420
Are you reaIIy gonna commit suicide for her?

1239
01:59:29,545 --> 01:59:31,589
You forget, I'm aIready dead.

1240
01:59:31,714 --> 01:59:35,843
Haven't you heard?
So is she.

1241
01:59:38,345 --> 01:59:40,389
You're Iying.

1242
01:59:41,931 --> 01:59:43,600
No!

1243
01:59:45,143 --> 01:59:46,478
Liar!

1244
01:59:46,895 --> 01:59:48,521
Liar!

1245
02:01:07,972 --> 02:01:10,015
She's waiting for you.

1246
02:01:28,366 --> 02:01:30,758
The hydrogen gas IeveI's too high.

1247
02:01:30,784 --> 02:01:33,312
One spark and the reactor wiII bIow.

1248
02:01:33,412 --> 02:01:35,456
I have to stop it.

1249
02:01:37,833 --> 02:01:39,530
Go to the top of the submarine.

1250
02:01:39,556 --> 02:01:41,570
I'II meet you in the torpedo bay.
Go!

1251
02:01:47,384 --> 02:01:49,386
The reactor is fIooded.

1252
02:01:51,220 --> 02:01:54,015
So it's safe even if this pIace bIows.

1253
02:02:25,796 --> 02:02:26,797
Hey!

1254
02:02:30,341 --> 02:02:31,342
Hey!

1255
02:02:38,015 --> 02:02:40,142
No, it's simpIy not the case.

1256
02:02:40,267 --> 02:02:42,311
No, before that.

1257
02:02:48,108 --> 02:02:49,150
Any word?

1258
02:02:49,275 --> 02:02:51,319
No. StiII no contact.

1259
02:02:55,907 --> 02:02:58,660
AIways wanted to have Christmas in Turkey.

1260
02:03:00,495 --> 02:03:02,497
Was that a Christmas joke?

1261
02:03:02,622 --> 02:03:04,791
From me? No.

1262
02:03:04,915 --> 02:03:06,333
No.

1263
02:03:06,458 --> 02:03:09,253
So isn't it time you unwrapped your present?

1264
02:03:09,378 --> 02:03:11,421
Oh, I think so.

1265
02:03:15,634 --> 02:03:18,679
- Look, what's that?
- The card.

1266
02:03:18,804 --> 02:03:20,931
- So he must be nearby.
- Where?

1267
02:03:23,516 --> 02:03:24,517
Where?

1268
02:03:24,642 --> 02:03:27,520
It picks up body heat so humans come out orange.

1269
02:03:30,022 --> 02:03:32,066
There.

1270
02:03:33,901 --> 02:03:36,779
I thought you said he was with Dr Jones.

1271
02:03:41,075 --> 02:03:42,909
It's getting redder.

1272
02:03:50,375 --> 02:03:51,835
007!

1273
02:03:56,798 --> 02:03:59,926
Must be a premature form of the miIIennium bug.

1274
02:04:03,220 --> 02:04:05,264
I was wrong about you.

1275
02:04:05,806 --> 02:04:07,850
Yeah? How so?

1276
02:04:09,643 --> 02:04:12,730
I thought Christmas onIy comes once a year.

1277
02:04:16,525 --> 02:04:17,101
