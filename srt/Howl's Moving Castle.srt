2
00:01:40,346 --> 00:01:41,757
Sophie,

3
00:01:41,889 --> 00:01:44,065
we just closed the shop.
You've done enough work.

4
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,406
Why don't you come out
with us this time?

5
00:01:46,435 --> 00:01:48,060
No, I better finish this.

6
00:01:48,187 --> 00:01:50,263
You go and have fun.

7
00:01:50,398 --> 00:01:52,640
All right, suit yourself.

8
00:01:52,775 --> 00:01:53,824
Let's go, girls.

9
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:55,852
Wait for me!
I'm ready.

10
00:01:55,987 --> 00:01:58,494
Do I look OK?
Look, it's Howl's castle!

11
00:01:58,531 --> 00:01:59,990
Where?
Howl?

12
00:02:00,116 --> 00:02:02,967
I've never seen it so close!

13
00:02:02,994 --> 00:02:05,749
Do you think Howl
will go into town?

14
00:02:12,128 --> 00:02:13,770
He's gone.

15
00:02:13,796 --> 00:02:16,601
No, he's just hiding in
the fog from those planes.

16
00:02:16,632 --> 00:02:19,009
Did you hear what happened to
that girl, Martha in south heaven?

17
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:21,011
They say Howl has
torn her heart out.

18
00:02:21,011 --> 00:02:22,654
Now I'm too scared
to go out!

19
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,776
What?

20
00:02:23,806 --> 00:02:26,716
Don't worry. He only
preys on pretty girls.

21
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,190
All right, let's go.

22
00:02:29,228 --> 00:02:32,208
You girls are so mean.

23
00:02:32,232 --> 00:02:34,532
It's not funny.

24
00:04:35,353 --> 00:04:38,105
Hey. Looks like a little
mouse lost its way.

25
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:40,307
Oh, no, I'm not lost.

26
00:04:40,441 --> 00:04:42,415
This little mouse looks thirsty.

27
00:04:42,443 --> 00:04:44,287
We should take her
for a cup of tea.

28
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,294
No thanks, my sister's
expecting me.

29
00:04:46,322 --> 00:04:48,581
She's pretty cute for a mouse.

30
00:04:48,616 --> 00:04:51,124
How old are you, anayway?
You live around here?

31
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,995
Leave me alone.

32
00:04:52,995 --> 00:04:56,096
You see? Your moustache
scares all the girls.

33
00:04:56,123 --> 00:04:59,082
So? She's even cuter
when she's scared.

34
00:04:59,127 --> 00:05:03,058
There you are, sweetheart. Sorry I'm
late. I was looking everywhere for you.

35
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:05,419
Hey, we're busy here.
Are you really?

36
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:09,084
It looked to me like the
two of you were just leaving.

37
00:05:09,095 --> 00:05:10,423
Hup!

38
00:05:10,555 --> 00:05:12,049
Hup!

39
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:14,423
What? Hey!

40
00:05:16,102 --> 00:05:17,910
Don't hold it against them.

41
00:05:17,937 --> 00:05:20,113
They're actually not all that bad.

42
00:05:20,147 --> 00:05:23,433
Where to? I'll be your
escort this evening.

43
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:25,975
I'm just going to the bakery.

44
00:05:26,112 --> 00:05:28,418
Don't get alarmed,
but I'm being followed.

45
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,107
Act normal.

46
00:05:50,803 --> 00:05:54,053
Sorry. Looks like you're involved..

47
00:05:56,683 --> 00:05:58,226
This way.

48
00:06:06,109 --> 00:06:07,485
Hold on..

49
00:06:11,823 --> 00:06:15,193
Now, straighten your
legs and start walking.

50
00:06:19,873 --> 00:06:22,993
See? Not so hard, is it?

51
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,637
You are a natural.

52
00:06:54,115 --> 00:06:56,238
I'll make sure to draw them off.

53
00:06:56,368 --> 00:06:58,656
But wait a bit before
you head back outside.

54
00:06:58,787 --> 00:07:00,661
OK.

55
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:03,031
That's my girl.

56
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:14,520
Excuse me, could we trouble
you for more falt biscuits?

57
00:07:14,552 --> 00:07:17,013
There you go. Do you any
have Lettie-shaped cookies?

58
00:07:17,013 --> 00:07:18,821
I'd buy those.
Here.

59
00:07:18,848 --> 00:07:20,146
What time do you get off?

60
00:07:20,183 --> 00:07:21,698
She what?

61
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:25,663
Hey, I'm over here.
Where are you going?

62
00:07:28,274 --> 00:07:29,703
Sophie?

63
00:07:29,734 --> 00:07:31,727
Lettie.
What's going on?

64
00:07:31,861 --> 00:07:35,048
Someone just told me you
floated down onto our balcony.

65
00:07:35,114 --> 00:07:37,605
So that did happen.
It wasn't a dream.

66
00:07:37,742 --> 00:07:40,031
Lettie, would you
like to use my office?

67
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:43,998
I should really get back to
work. Thank you though.

68
00:07:43,998 --> 00:07:48,459
Wow. He must have
been a wizard then.

69
00:07:48,586 --> 00:07:50,460
But he was so kind to me.

70
00:07:50,588 --> 00:07:53,209
He rescued me, Lettie.

71
00:07:53,341 --> 00:07:56,295
Of course he did. He was
trying to steal your heart!

72
00:07:56,427 --> 00:07:58,669
You are so lucky, Sophie.

73
00:07:58,763 --> 00:08:01,005
If that wizard were Howl,
he would have eaten it.

74
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,884
No, he wouldn't.

75
00:08:03,017 --> 00:08:05,010
Howl only does that
to beautiful girls.

76
00:08:05,144 --> 00:08:06,935
Don't give me that.

77
00:08:07,063 --> 00:08:10,024
You need to be more careful.
It's dangerous out there.

78
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:14,318
Even the Witch of the Waste
is back on the prowl.

79
00:08:14,403 --> 00:08:17,440
Are you listening?

80
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:24,007
Lettie, the chocolate,
the clairs are done.

81
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:25,995
OK. I'll be right there.

82
00:08:26,082 --> 00:08:27,659
Thanks.

83
00:08:28,793 --> 00:08:30,536
All right. I better get going then.

84
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:33,243
I just wanted to make sure
that you were doing OK.

85
00:08:35,132 --> 00:08:37,588
Hello, Lettie.
Hi, how are you doing?

86
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:42,132
Now Sophie, do you really want to spend
the rest of your life in that hat shop?

87
00:08:42,765 --> 00:08:44,988
The shop was just
so important to Father.

88
00:08:45,017 --> 00:08:46,595
And I'm the eldest,
I don't mind.

89
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:48,969
I'm not asking what Father
would have wanted.

90
00:08:49,104 --> 00:08:51,114
I want to know what you want.

91
00:08:51,148 --> 00:08:52,179
Well....

92
00:08:52,316 --> 00:08:53,644
See you later, Lettie.

93
00:08:53,776 --> 00:08:55,749
Good seeing you again.
You too.

94
00:08:55,778 --> 00:08:58,613
I better be going.
It's your life, Sophie.

95
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:02,330
Do something for yourself
for once, will you? Bye, Lettie.

96
00:10:09,017 --> 00:10:10,974
I'm sorry, but the shop's
closed now, ma'am.

97
00:10:11,102 --> 00:10:14,139
I could have sworn I locked
that door. Must have forgotten.

98
00:10:16,107 --> 00:10:18,314
What a tacky shop.

99
00:10:18,401 --> 00:10:21,071
I've never seen such
tacky little hats.

100
00:10:21,863 --> 00:10:25,279
Yet you're by far
the tackiest thing here.

101
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:28,698
I'm afraid you will
have to leave now.

102
00:10:34,626 --> 00:10:37,461
The door's over here, ma'am.
We're closed.

103
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:40,709
Standing up to the
Witch of the Waste,

104
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,966
that's plucky.

105
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:45,051
The Witch of the Waste?

106
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:54,902
The best part of that spell is
you can't tell anyone about it.

107
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:58,437
My regards to Howl..

108
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:22,419
Oh... no.

109
00:11:43,694 --> 00:11:45,687
That's really me, isn't it?

110
00:11:45,821 --> 00:11:48,027
I've got to stay calm.

111
00:12:04,882 --> 00:12:06,673
I've got to stay calm!

112
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,959
Now, there's no use
panicking, Sophie.

113
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:12,090
It's a bad dream, that's all.

114
00:12:12,222 --> 00:12:14,975
Just go inside, go to bed.

115
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:18,925
You're gonna be fine, Sophie.
You're gonna be fine.

116
00:12:19,063 --> 00:12:21,388
Got to stay calm.

117
00:12:31,158 --> 00:12:32,669
Look who's here!

118
00:12:32,701 --> 00:12:35,588
You're back! You here
ma'am! Look at you!

119
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:38,954
What do you think?
It's all the rage in Kingsbury.

120
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,054
It's gorgeous!

121
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:43,517
I know! Our customers
will love it! Sophie!

122
00:12:43,545 --> 00:12:45,104
Sophie!

123
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:48,101
I'm afraid your daughter hasn't
come downstairs yet today, ma'am.

124
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:50,256
That's strange. I wonder
what's wrong.

125
00:12:52,596 --> 00:12:54,138
Sophie!

126
00:12:56,057 --> 00:12:57,433
Sophie!

127
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:00,642
Sophie!

128
00:13:00,771 --> 00:13:02,644
Don't come in here.

129
00:13:02,773 --> 00:13:04,895
I've got a bad cold.

130
00:13:05,025 --> 00:13:07,064
I don't want you to catch it.

131
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:11,776
You sound ghastly, like
some 90-year-old woman.

132
00:13:11,907 --> 00:13:14,694
I'll just stay in bed
all day, so you go on.

133
00:13:14,826 --> 00:13:16,368
Well....

134
00:13:16,494 --> 00:13:17,739
If you insist.

135
00:13:19,623 --> 00:13:21,615
Up we go.

136
00:13:32,552 --> 00:13:34,509
This isn't so bad now, is it?

137
00:13:34,637 --> 00:13:36,315
You're still in pretty
good shape.

138
00:13:36,347 --> 00:13:39,817
And your clothes finally suit you.

139
00:13:41,227 --> 00:13:43,932
But you can't stay here
like this for long.

140
00:13:54,282 --> 00:13:59,074
Being old is worse
than I thought.

141
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:06,249
They say their prince
is missing.

142
00:14:06,377 --> 00:14:08,037
And they're blaming us.

143
00:14:08,171 --> 00:14:11,705
Yeah and it sounds like
they're gonna start a war.

144
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,258
Nobody wants to go to war.

145
00:14:13,384 --> 00:14:15,460
Let's hope the prince
turns up soon.

146
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:25,308
Excuse me, could
you use some help?

147
00:14:25,438 --> 00:14:27,929
I'll be fine, but thanks
for offering.

148
00:14:28,065 --> 00:14:29,607
That was really kind.

149
00:14:29,734 --> 00:14:33,203
Sure, there's room in the back if you
like, but where are you headed?

150
00:14:33,237 --> 00:14:36,024
Just a little ways farther
than where you're going.

151
00:14:40,077 --> 00:14:42,995
You're crazy if you
do this, Grandma!

152
00:14:43,122 --> 00:14:45,743
There's nothing but witches
and wizards out there!

153
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,914
Thank you.
I'll keep that in mind.

154
00:14:48,043 --> 00:14:50,332
She's going to the
Wastes by herself?

155
00:14:50,463 --> 00:14:52,918
She says she's looking
for her younger sister.

156
00:15:07,396 --> 00:15:10,017
I'll never get there
with these legs.

157
00:15:11,734 --> 00:15:14,937
At least my teeth
haven't fallen out yet.

158
00:15:21,952 --> 00:15:24,573
That would make a nice cane.

159
00:15:24,705 --> 00:15:26,329
Up we go.

160
00:15:33,088 --> 00:15:35,007
Might be too big.

161
00:15:45,892 --> 00:15:47,969
This is one stubborn branch.

162
00:15:49,855 --> 00:15:53,058
You're not getting the
best of this old lady.

163
00:15:59,865 --> 00:16:01,359
Oh!

164
00:16:05,287 --> 00:16:06,995
Just a scarecrow!

165
00:16:07,122 --> 00:16:09,791
I was afraid you were
one of those blob men.

166
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,917
But how're you standing
on your own like that?

167
00:16:15,088 --> 00:16:17,330
You're head's a turnip.

168
00:16:17,465 --> 00:16:21,000
I've always hated turnips,
ever since I was little.

169
00:16:21,136 --> 00:16:24,006
At least you're not
upside down now.

170
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:25,681
So long.

171
00:16:32,272 --> 00:16:34,727
It's too cold.

172
00:16:34,858 --> 00:16:37,645
And I can still see the town.
I've barely moved.

173
00:16:42,449 --> 00:16:44,774
Go away! Quit following me!

174
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:47,780
There's no need to thank me,
you don't owe me a thing.

175
00:16:47,912 --> 00:16:50,119
I'm sure you have some
kind of spell on you,

176
00:16:50,248 --> 00:16:53,083
and I've had more than enough
of witches and spells.

177
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:57,670
So, just go find some
field and stand in it!

178
00:17:17,108 --> 00:17:20,358
Thank you, this cane is perfect,
it's just what I need.

179
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:22,858
If you'd like to do me
one more favor,

180
00:17:22,989 --> 00:17:25,444
you could run off and
find me a place to stay.

181
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:39,164
I seem to have become
quite cunning in my old age.

182
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,171
A battleship!

183
00:17:51,308 --> 00:17:53,467
Oh!

184
00:17:53,602 --> 00:17:56,224
Why do you get so
cold when you're old?

185
00:17:56,355 --> 00:18:00,732
I'm fatter than ever, yet the
wind blows right through me.

186
00:18:15,082 --> 00:18:19,791
Someone's got a fire going.
Maybe there's a cabin nearby.

187
00:18:39,106 --> 00:18:42,023
You turnip-head!
That's Howl's castle!

188
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:46,100
That is not what I meant when
I asked for a place to stay.

189
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:00,158
Look at that. They
call this a castle?

190
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:22,477
Is that the way in?

191
00:19:24,234 --> 00:19:26,523
Slow down!

192
00:19:28,446 --> 00:19:30,937
For heaven's sake.

193
00:19:31,074 --> 00:19:35,173
Make up your mind. Are you
gonna let me on or not?

194
00:19:38,081 --> 00:19:40,702
Oh, my shawl!

195
00:19:52,887 --> 00:19:55,674
It's nice and warm in
there, so I'm going in.

196
00:19:55,807 --> 00:19:57,965
Oh, my shawl, thank you.

197
00:19:58,101 --> 00:20:03,044
I'm sure Howl won't eat the heart
of a shrived, old lady like me.

198
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:06,985
It's been a pleasure meeting you.

199
00:20:06,985 --> 00:20:09,772
Even if you are my least
favorite vegetable.

200
00:20:09,904 --> 00:20:12,360
Take care, Turnip-head.

201
00:20:54,573 --> 00:20:56,696
There we go.

202
00:20:58,994 --> 00:21:00,904
What a dump.

203
00:21:00,996 --> 00:21:03,783
When I think castle,
this is not what I picture.

204
00:21:12,132 --> 00:21:17,091
Well, one nice thing about getting
old is nothing frightens you.

205
00:21:26,188 --> 00:21:29,272
I don't envy you, lady.
That is one bad curse.

206
00:21:29,399 --> 00:21:33,918
Curses are tough. You're gonna have a
very hard time getting rid of that one.

207
00:21:33,946 --> 00:21:35,321
The fire spoke!

208
00:21:35,447 --> 00:21:38,382
Let me guess. The curse won't
allow you to talk about it, right?

209
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:39,986
Are you Howl?

210
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:43,303
No, I'm an extremely powerful
fire demon named Calcifer.

211
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:44,998
I just like to do that
once in a while.

212
00:21:44,998 --> 00:21:49,791
A fire demon. Well, then you
should be able to break my curse.

213
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,135
Maybe, maybe not.

214
00:21:51,171 --> 00:21:54,058
Listen, if you can find a way
to break the spell that's on me,

215
00:21:54,091 --> 00:21:56,895
then I'll break the spell
that's on you, you got it?

216
00:21:56,927 --> 00:21:59,928
If you're a demon, how do
I know I can trust you?

217
00:22:00,055 --> 00:22:02,261
You promise to help
me if I help you?

218
00:22:02,391 --> 00:22:06,471
I don't know, lady. Demons
don't make promises.

219
00:22:06,603 --> 00:22:08,679
Then go find someone else.

220
00:22:08,814 --> 00:22:10,605
Come on! You should
feel sorry for me!

221
00:22:10,732 --> 00:22:12,689
That spell keeps me
stuck in this castle,

222
00:22:12,818 --> 00:22:14,691
and Howl treats me
like I'm his slave.

223
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:17,493
It burns me up. You gotta keep
the water hot, the rooms warm.

224
00:22:17,531 --> 00:22:19,789
keep the castle moving.
Oh, that's rough.

225
00:22:19,825 --> 00:22:21,798
Come on! You ever
try to move a castle?

226
00:22:21,827 --> 00:22:24,781
If you can figure out how to
break this thing I'm in with Howl,

227
00:22:24,913 --> 00:22:26,241
then you can break my spell.

228
00:22:26,373 --> 00:22:29,742
After that, I can easily
break the spell that's on you.

229
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:33,334
All right, it's a deal.

230
00:22:35,006 --> 00:22:37,758
Hey, lady? Lady?

231
00:22:38,677 --> 00:22:41,167
Hello? Lady? Hello? Hey!

232
00:22:41,304 --> 00:22:43,380
Lady? Lady?

233
00:22:43,515 --> 00:22:46,302
Hey, let me get over there.

234
00:22:46,434 --> 00:22:48,474
Some big help you're gonna be.

235
00:23:42,448 --> 00:23:44,322
Hey, who's this lady?

236
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:47,119
Porthaven door.
How'd she get in here?

237
00:23:54,752 --> 00:23:56,958
Stand by.

238
00:24:01,383 --> 00:24:03,127
Mr. Mayor, good day.

239
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:07,014
Good afternoon, sir. Would the
great Wizard Jenkins be at home?

240
00:24:07,014 --> 00:24:09,552
I am afraid that my master
is out at the moment.

241
00:24:09,683 --> 00:24:12,019
I speak for him in his absence.

242
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:14,937
An invitation from His
Majesty the King.

243
00:24:15,064 --> 00:24:16,891
The time for war is upon us.

244
00:24:17,024 --> 00:24:21,485
His Majesty requires that every
witch and wizard aid our homeland.

245
00:24:21,612 --> 00:24:24,945
Wizard Jenkins must report
to the palace immediately.

246
00:24:25,074 --> 00:24:27,031
That is all.
War....

247
00:24:28,327 --> 00:24:30,450
I can't believe it's come to this.

248
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:33,284
And what do you think
you're doing here, Grandma?

249
00:24:33,415 --> 00:24:35,324
Calcifer said that
I could come in.

250
00:24:35,459 --> 00:24:38,994
I did not. She just wandered
in here from the Wastes.

251
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:42,007
She's from the Wastes?

252
00:24:42,007 --> 00:24:43,967
How do we know that
she's not a witch?

253
00:24:43,967 --> 00:24:45,969
Do you really think I'd
let a witch in here?

254
00:24:45,969 --> 00:24:49,255
Porthaven door again!

255
00:24:49,389 --> 00:24:51,429
Must be a customer.

256
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,768
Stand by.

257
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,231
Yes, my dear child?

258
00:24:59,358 --> 00:25:01,350
My mom sent me
to pick up a spell.

259
00:25:01,485 --> 00:25:04,521
Yes, do come in.
OK.

260
00:25:05,489 --> 00:25:08,443
Just keep quiet and don't
cause any trouble, Grandma.

261
00:25:24,049 --> 00:25:25,958
It's not the Wastes.

262
00:25:26,092 --> 00:25:29,757
Excuse me, Granny,
are you a witch too?

263
00:25:29,888 --> 00:25:32,972
That's right. I'm the
scariest witch of them all.

264
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:37,429
Dust your ship with this powder
and the winds will favor it.

265
00:25:37,562 --> 00:25:39,187
Thanks.

266
00:25:40,857 --> 00:25:42,482
Farewell, child.

267
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,648
Quit telling lies to
our customers.

268
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,903
What about you?
You're wearing a disguise.

269
00:25:49,032 --> 00:25:51,375
I have to. I'm
practicing my magic.

270
00:25:53,077 --> 00:25:55,366
It's the Kingsbury door!

271
00:25:56,748 --> 00:25:58,028
Stand by.

272
00:26:02,879 --> 00:26:05,766
Good day. Would this be the residence
of the great Wizard Pendragon?

273
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:06,997
It is.

274
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:08,592
I bear an invitation

275
00:26:08,718 --> 00:26:09,916
from His Majesty the King.

276
00:26:10,053 --> 00:26:12,970
Please inform Mr. Pendragon
that all witches and wizards

277
00:26:13,097 --> 00:26:15,486
are required to report
for duty at the palace.

278
00:26:15,516 --> 00:26:18,268
I will inform him right away.

279
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,615
This is the royal city,
isn't it?

280
00:26:35,745 --> 00:26:38,829
Move it, Grandma or
you'll lose your nose.

281
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:45,624
And stop wandering around!

282
00:27:22,124 --> 00:27:25,458
Leave it alone, Grandma.
I'm getting angry.

283
00:27:25,586 --> 00:27:27,460
This is a magic house,
isn't it?

284
00:27:27,588 --> 00:27:28,619
Oh!

285
00:27:28,756 --> 00:27:30,962
So, tell me, where
does the black one lead?

286
00:27:31,091 --> 00:27:32,716
Only Master Howl knows that.

287
00:27:32,843 --> 00:27:35,879
I need some breakfast.
I'm starved.

288
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,270
Don't you want to have
some bacon and eggs?

289
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:51,978
Yeah, but we can't use the fire.
Master Howl's not here.

290
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,029
Don't worry, I can cook.

291
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:01,126
It doesn't matter if you can cook.
Calcifer only obeys Master Howl.

292
00:28:01,163 --> 00:28:03,736
That's right, lady. I'm not
taking any orders from you.

293
00:28:03,832 --> 00:28:06,960
Oh, there's my hat.

294
00:28:08,962 --> 00:28:10,753
That's better.

295
00:28:10,881 --> 00:28:13,798
All right, Calcifer.
Let's get cooking.

296
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:17,211
I don't cook! I'm a scary
and powerful fire demon!

297
00:28:19,139 --> 00:28:22,140
How would you like a bucket
of cold water in your face?

298
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:25,766
Or maybe I should tell
Howl about our bargain?

299
00:28:25,896 --> 00:28:27,935
Stupid me!

300
00:28:28,064 --> 00:28:30,852
I never should have
let her in here.

301
00:28:30,984 --> 00:28:33,078
So, what'll it be?

302
00:28:36,156 --> 00:28:39,110
That's right. That's a good fire.

303
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:44,407
Here's another curse.
May all your bacon burn.

304
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:46,828
Calcifer's doing what she says.

305
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,745
I think I'd like some tea too.
Do you have a kettle?

306
00:28:49,878 --> 00:28:51,917
Sure. Hey, what are you doing?

307
00:28:52,088 --> 00:28:57,720
Don't get the kettle! Whose side are you
on anyway? Markl, what are you doing?

308
00:29:00,096 --> 00:29:02,817
Master Howl, the king's
messengers were here.

309
00:29:02,849 --> 00:29:04,806
They said you have
to report to the palace

310
00:29:04,934 --> 00:29:07,604
as both Pendragon and Jenkins.

311
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:19,029
Calcifer?

312
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:21,031
You're being so obedient.

313
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,032
Not on purpose. She bullied me.

314
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:26,327
Not just anybody can do that.

315
00:29:26,456 --> 00:29:28,329
And you are... who?

316
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:31,661
You can just call me Grandma Sophie.

317
00:29:31,753 --> 00:29:34,326
I'm your new cleaning lady.
I just started work today.

318
00:29:34,464 --> 00:29:36,222
Give that to me.

319
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:43,093
Hand me two more slices of that
bacon and 6 more of those eggs.

320
00:30:03,576 --> 00:30:06,363
Yummy.

321
00:30:13,586 --> 00:30:15,993
So, then, who hired
you to clean?

322
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:20,968
Calcifer did. He's disgusted
by how dirty it is in here.

323
00:30:22,595 --> 00:30:25,050
Markl, get the plates.

324
00:30:27,224 --> 00:30:30,842
Wait a second, you're all gonna
eat while I do all the work?

325
00:30:30,978 --> 00:30:33,433
Come have some breakfast,
Sophie.

326
00:30:37,776 --> 00:30:39,983
Take a seat.

327
00:30:54,001 --> 00:30:55,495
Which do you want?

328
00:30:55,627 --> 00:30:58,035
You only get one
'cause the rest are dirty.

329
00:31:00,674 --> 00:31:03,046
Looks like I've got
my work cut out for me.

330
00:31:05,012 --> 00:31:07,503
Bread, Markl?
Thanks.

331
00:31:09,016 --> 00:31:11,471
Sophie?
Yes, thank you.

332
00:31:13,103 --> 00:31:16,768
So, friends, enjoy.
Bon appetit.

333
00:31:16,898 --> 00:31:19,389
I can't remember the last time
we had a real breakfast.

334
00:31:26,033 --> 00:31:29,567
Even the manners are
a mess in this house.

335
00:31:29,703 --> 00:31:33,588
So, what do you have hidden
in your pocket, Sophie?

336
00:31:44,259 --> 00:31:46,133
What is this?
Give it to me.

337
00:31:53,101 --> 00:31:55,971
Scorch marks. Howl,
can you read them?

338
00:31:56,104 --> 00:31:58,346
That is ancient sorcery.

339
00:31:58,481 --> 00:32:00,059
And quite powerful too.

340
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,985
It's from the Witch of the Waste?

341
00:32:01,985 --> 00:32:04,902
"You who swallowed a falling star,

342
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:08,778
oh, heartless man, your heart
shall soon belong to me."

343
00:32:08,908 --> 00:32:10,782
That can't be good for the table.

344
00:32:23,965 --> 00:32:26,041
Wow! It's gone!

345
00:32:26,175 --> 00:32:28,970
The mark may be gone,
but the spell is still there.

346
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:32,884
Excuse me, my friends,
please continue your meal.

347
00:32:33,015 --> 00:32:36,266
Calcifer, move the castle
60 miles to the west.

348
00:32:40,982 --> 00:32:44,148
And while you're at it,
make hot water for my bath.

349
00:32:44,277 --> 00:32:47,396
Fine. Like moving the
castle isn't hard enough?

350
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:50,021
You're not working for the
Witch of the Waste, are you?

351
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:53,032
I would never work for that witch!

352
00:32:53,161 --> 00:32:55,367
She's the one who....

353
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:01,621
I'm actually a... yuh....

354
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,298
If I ever get my hands on that witch,
I'm going to wring her fat neck!

355
00:33:10,428 --> 00:33:13,843
Finish your breakfast!

356
00:33:16,017 --> 00:33:18,009
I've had enough of this!

357
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,974
You bugs better run before
I bite your heads off!

358
00:33:22,356 --> 00:33:26,436
I'm sick of being treated
like some timid little old lady.

359
00:33:30,948 --> 00:33:33,254
Hello, sir, is my potion ready?

360
00:33:33,284 --> 00:33:34,861
Come back later.

361
00:33:34,994 --> 00:33:36,951
There's a witch on
a rampage in there.

362
00:33:43,502 --> 00:33:46,337
Sophie, please!

363
00:33:46,463 --> 00:33:48,954
Sophie! Please help me!
I'm going out!

364
00:33:50,009 --> 00:33:53,508
Please, get me some
firewood, quick!

365
00:33:53,637 --> 00:33:57,057
Hey, please help me.
Wait, what are you doing?

366
00:33:57,057 --> 00:33:59,215
Don't! I'll fall!
You crazy lady with tongs!

367
00:33:59,351 --> 00:34:01,723
You'll be fine.
I'll fall! Help!

368
00:34:01,854 --> 00:34:03,312
I'm just sweeping out the ashes.

369
00:34:03,439 --> 00:34:06,558
No, I'm not fine!  Please!

370
00:34:06,692 --> 00:34:08,435
I'm going out!

371
00:34:10,571 --> 00:34:11,981
Please. I'm falling.

372
00:34:13,991 --> 00:34:16,826
Help! I'm falling!

373
00:34:19,871 --> 00:34:21,947
Sophie, hurry up, please.

374
00:34:22,082 --> 00:34:24,999
Hurry, please. P.. P....

375
00:34:46,857 --> 00:34:50,060
I'd appreciate it if you
didn't torment my friend.

376
00:34:55,073 --> 00:34:57,943
Master Howl, are
you going out now?

377
00:34:59,828 --> 00:35:04,655
Markl, make sure the cleaning lady
doesn't get carried away while I'm gone.

378
00:35:09,254 --> 00:35:11,293
Sophie, what did you do now?

379
00:35:11,423 --> 00:35:13,878
She almost smothered me!

380
00:35:14,008 --> 00:35:17,011
If I die, Howl dies too,
I hope you know.

381
00:35:17,011 --> 00:35:19,337
Be quiet. You're all right.

382
00:35:19,472 --> 00:35:21,465
Now quit bothering me,
I've got a job to do.

383
00:35:22,392 --> 00:35:25,061
Wait, you can't come up here!

384
00:35:25,186 --> 00:35:28,637
Whatever you don't want me
to clean, better hide it now.

385
00:35:28,773 --> 00:35:31,893
Save my room for last, OK?

386
00:35:35,321 --> 00:35:37,943
These little outbursts seem
to be giving me some energy.

387
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:43,446
What a mess.

388
00:35:53,047 --> 00:35:55,040
Oh!

389
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:21,907
Incredible!

390
00:36:22,034 --> 00:36:24,359
Calcifer! Calcifer!

391
00:36:24,495 --> 00:36:26,487
Are you the one
moving the castle?

392
00:36:26,622 --> 00:36:29,427
Of course I am. No one else
does any work around here.

393
00:36:29,458 --> 00:36:31,052
I am thoroughly impressed!

394
00:36:31,085 --> 00:36:35,599
You are a first-class fire demon.
I like your spark.

395
00:36:36,632 --> 00:36:40,795
She likes my spark!

396
00:36:47,059 --> 00:36:48,933
Not ready! Not ready!

397
00:37:21,093 --> 00:37:22,836
It's beautiful.

398
00:37:22,969 --> 00:37:25,342
Yeah. It's called Star Lake.

399
00:37:29,893 --> 00:37:31,802
Hey, what's that stick
doing in there?

400
00:37:31,937 --> 00:37:36,314
Dear. Give me a hand, Markl.

401
00:37:43,031 --> 00:37:44,573
It's a scarecrow.

402
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:46,906
Yep, I've been calling
him Turnip-head.

403
00:37:47,035 --> 00:37:49,906
Somehow he always manages
to get stuck upside down.

404
00:37:58,588 --> 00:38:00,830
He keeps following me everywhere.

405
00:38:00,965 --> 00:38:03,005
Seems to have taken a liking to me.

406
00:38:03,134 --> 00:38:05,590
That's weird. Are you sure
you're not a witch, Sophie?

407
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,552
Yes! I'm the worst kind of
witch ever, the kind that cleans.

408
00:38:38,378 --> 00:38:41,628
Quit pulling so hard, Turnip-head!

409
00:38:50,973 --> 00:38:53,013
I think he likes doing the laundry.

410
00:38:53,142 --> 00:38:56,641
Looks like he'll have
it dry in no time.

411
00:38:57,855 --> 00:39:00,014
I bet he's some kind of demon.

412
00:39:00,149 --> 00:39:02,023
Calcifer doesn't seem
to mind him at all.

413
00:39:02,151 --> 00:39:06,231
You're right. He probably is a demon.

414
00:39:06,364 --> 00:39:09,946
But he led me here, so
maybe he's the good kind.

415
00:39:51,951 --> 00:39:54,073
We got all the laundry
put away, Sophie.

416
00:39:54,203 --> 00:39:55,780
Oh, thank you, Markl.

417
00:39:55,913 --> 00:40:00,290
When you're old, all you want
to do is stare at the scenery.

418
00:40:00,417 --> 00:40:04,497
It's so strange, I've never
felt so peaceful before.

419
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,286
You OK? I mean, you smell terrible.

420
00:41:43,728 --> 00:41:45,886
You shouldn't keep
flying around like that.

421
00:41:46,022 --> 00:41:50,269
Soon you won't be able
to turn back into a human.

422
00:41:53,946 --> 00:41:55,405
Isn't this great?

423
00:41:55,531 --> 00:41:57,156
Sophie put these here for me.

424
00:41:59,785 --> 00:42:01,328
This war is terrible.

425
00:42:01,454 --> 00:42:04,371
They've bombed from the southern
coast to the northern border.

426
00:42:04,499 --> 00:42:05,993
It's all in flames now.

427
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:08,533
I can't stand the fire in gunpowder.

428
00:42:08,669 --> 00:42:11,504
Those dopey guys have
absolutely no manners.

429
00:42:11,631 --> 00:42:15,598
My own kind attacked me today.
Who, the Witch of the Waste?

430
00:42:15,635 --> 00:42:19,217
No, some hack wizards who turned
themselves into monsters for the king.

431
00:42:19,305 --> 00:42:22,425
Those wizards are going
to regret doing that.

432
00:42:22,558 --> 00:42:25,014
They'll never change
back into humans.

433
00:42:25,144 --> 00:42:28,061
After the war, they won't
recall they ever were human.

434
00:42:28,189 --> 00:42:31,143
Hey, aren't you supposed
to report to the king too?

435
00:42:31,275 --> 00:42:34,478
I'm tired. Make some
hot water for my bath.

436
00:42:34,612 --> 00:42:36,688
What? Not again.

437
00:43:09,146 --> 00:43:10,474
Is Howl back?

438
00:43:10,606 --> 00:43:13,275
Yes. He's wasting all
my hot water again.

439
00:43:17,863 --> 00:43:19,855
I don't know why
we're doing this.

440
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:22,695
Master Howl hardly eats
anything. Too bad.

441
00:43:22,784 --> 00:43:24,907
Good morning.
Good morning.

442
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:31,374
Don't you love early morning markets?
And just look at the water!

443
00:43:31,501 --> 00:43:34,419
I've never seen the ocean
before! It's beautiful!

444
00:43:34,546 --> 00:43:36,171
It always looks like that.

445
00:43:45,098 --> 00:43:47,091
I hate potatoes.

446
00:43:47,184 --> 00:43:48,559
Pay up.

447
00:43:48,685 --> 00:43:52,337
Thanks, have a nice day.
Thank you. Come again.

448
00:43:53,023 --> 00:43:55,893
All our fish were caught
fresh this morning.

449
00:43:57,235 --> 00:43:59,275
I hate fish.

450
00:43:59,404 --> 00:44:01,278
One of our ships
is in the harbor!

451
00:44:01,406 --> 00:44:02,900
It looks like it's on fire!

452
00:44:03,033 --> 00:44:05,025
Looks like there's
been a serious battle.

453
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,829
What happened?
Sorry, lady, we're closed.

454
00:44:07,954 --> 00:44:09,532
The ship, it's sinking!

455
00:44:32,187 --> 00:44:34,096
Come on, Sophie,
let's get a better look.

456
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:37,931
No, I've seen all I can
take. Let's go home.

457
00:44:38,067 --> 00:44:40,938
I can't believe it. It's our
most advanced battleship.

458
00:44:44,282 --> 00:44:47,069
The witch's henchmen are here.

459
00:44:47,201 --> 00:44:49,241
What?
Quiet down.

460
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:51,944
They're only a few feet away.

461
00:44:57,128 --> 00:44:58,539
He's gone.

462
00:44:58,671 --> 00:45:01,941
I don't understand why no
one else seemed to notice him.

463
00:45:07,138 --> 00:45:08,973
Look! There they are!

464
00:45:08,973 --> 00:45:11,030
That plane! That's what
dropped the bombs!

465
00:45:11,058 --> 00:45:14,216
Look up there, Sophie.
It's the enemy's airship!

466
00:45:18,899 --> 00:45:20,857
Sophie! Wait up! Sophie!

467
00:45:20,943 --> 00:45:23,648
Ignore the flyers.
They're enemy propaganda.

468
00:45:28,743 --> 00:45:30,403
Sophie, are you OK?

469
00:45:36,417 --> 00:45:38,540
I just need a glass of water.

470
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:40,211
I'll get it.

471
00:45:55,144 --> 00:45:58,513
Sophie! You sabotaged me!
Look!

472
00:45:58,647 --> 00:46:00,225
Look what you've
done to my hair!

473
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:01,984
Look!

474
00:46:01,984 --> 00:46:04,819
What a pretty color.
It's hideous!

475
00:46:04,903 --> 00:46:08,319
You completely ruined my
magic potions in the bathroom!

476
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:12,035
I just organized things,
Howl, nothing's ruined.

477
00:46:12,161 --> 00:46:13,996
Wrong! Wrong!

478
00:46:13,996 --> 00:46:17,863
I specifically ordered you
not to get carried away!

479
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,428
Now I'm repulsive.

480
00:46:19,459 --> 00:46:22,829
I can't live like this.

481
00:46:24,131 --> 00:46:26,289
Come on, it's not that bad.

482
00:46:34,099 --> 00:46:36,934
You should look at it now.
This shade is even better.

483
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,934
I give up.

484
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:42,733
I see no point in living
if I can't be beautiful.

485
00:46:53,452 --> 00:46:56,405
Howl, cut it out.
Howl, no, stop it.

486
00:46:56,538 --> 00:46:58,531
He's calling the Spirits
of Darkness.

487
00:46:58,665 --> 00:47:02,449
I saw him do this once before
when a girl dumped him.

488
00:47:05,005 --> 00:47:07,377
Now, Howl, you're all right.

489
00:47:07,507 --> 00:47:09,963
We'll just dye your
hair back again.

490
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:13,213
OK?

491
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:23,763
Fine! So, you think
you've got it bad?

492
00:47:23,898 --> 00:47:26,983
I've never once been
beautiful in my entire life!

493
00:47:28,987 --> 00:47:31,359
I've had enough of this place!

494
00:48:09,735 --> 00:48:11,728
Thank you, Turnip-head.

495
00:48:11,821 --> 00:48:13,813
How did you get to be so kind?

496
00:48:13,948 --> 00:48:16,984
Sophie, get back inside, we need
your help! Howl's in trouble!

497
00:48:17,118 --> 00:48:19,324
Howl, cut it out!
I'm gonna drown!

498
00:48:19,453 --> 00:48:22,988
I'm drowning here, Howl.
Sophie! Sophie, help him, please!

499
00:48:23,124 --> 00:48:25,449
Sophie! Do something!

500
00:48:27,086 --> 00:48:29,921
Such drama.
Is he dead?

501
00:48:30,047 --> 00:48:32,965
No, he's fine. He's just
throwing a tantrum.

502
00:48:33,092 --> 00:48:36,011
Come on. Give me
a hand. OK.

503
00:48:39,265 --> 00:48:41,056
Get the hot water running.

504
00:48:41,142 --> 00:48:42,304
Right.

505
00:48:42,435 --> 00:48:44,973
Come on, Howl, you
can still walk.

506
00:48:56,198 --> 00:48:57,990
Get him cleaned up, Markl.

507
00:48:58,117 --> 00:48:59,611
I will.

508
00:49:01,036 --> 00:49:03,112
Now I have to mop again.

509
00:49:12,005 --> 00:49:14,497
This says they've landed
on the coast already.

510
00:49:14,633 --> 00:49:15,831
Where?
North.

511
00:49:26,019 --> 00:49:28,593
Howl, I'm coming in.

512
00:49:36,029 --> 00:49:38,983
I brought you some
warm milk. Want a sip?

513
00:49:41,702 --> 00:49:43,362
I'll leave it here for you then.

514
00:49:43,495 --> 00:49:46,366
Try to drink it before
it gets cold.

515
00:49:49,001 --> 00:49:51,408
Sophie, wait.

516
00:49:58,969 --> 00:50:00,926
Do you want some milk?

517
00:50:10,272 --> 00:50:14,221
The Witch of the Waste
is trying to find my castle.

518
00:50:15,402 --> 00:50:18,989
I saw her henchmen at the harbor.

519
00:50:18,989 --> 00:50:21,943
I am such a big coward,
all I do is hide.

520
00:50:22,075 --> 00:50:25,658
And all of this magic is just
to keep everybody away.

521
00:50:25,787 --> 00:50:27,827
I can't stand how scared I am.

522
00:50:29,332 --> 00:50:32,748
Howl, why is the Witch of the
Waste trying to hunt you down?

523
00:50:32,877 --> 00:50:37,005
She was once quite beautiful,
so I decided to pursue her.

524
00:50:37,132 --> 00:50:39,124
Then I realized she wasn't.

525
00:50:39,259 --> 00:50:41,416
So as usual, I ran away.

526
00:50:43,596 --> 00:50:47,030
I can't run much longer though.
I have to report to the palace

527
00:50:47,058 --> 00:50:49,863
as both Pendragon and Jenkins.

528
00:50:49,894 --> 00:50:52,236
How many aliases do
you have anyway?

529
00:50:52,272 --> 00:50:56,127
As many as I need
to keep my freedom.

530
00:50:56,192 --> 00:51:00,124
Just refuse the king's
invitation. See that?

531
00:51:00,154 --> 00:51:03,754
That's the oath I took when I
entered the Royal Sorcery Academy.

532
00:51:03,783 --> 00:51:06,967
I must report to the palace
whenever summoned.

533
00:51:06,995 --> 00:51:09,846
You know, Howl, I think
that you should see the king.

534
00:51:09,872 --> 00:51:11,746
What?

535
00:51:11,874 --> 00:51:13,599
Give him a piece of your mind.

536
00:51:13,626 --> 00:51:15,535
Tell him this war is pointless.

537
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:17,579
And you refuse to take part?

538
00:51:19,549 --> 00:51:22,519
You obviously don't know
what these people are like.

539
00:51:22,552 --> 00:51:24,425
But he's our king.

540
00:51:24,554 --> 00:51:28,437
He should want to hear what
all his citizens have to say.

541
00:51:28,474 --> 00:51:29,976
I got it!

542
00:51:29,976 --> 00:51:33,048
Why don't you go to
the palace for me?

543
00:51:34,063 --> 00:51:36,571
Just say that you're
Pendragon's mother,

544
00:51:36,607 --> 00:51:38,434
and your son is such
a cowardly wizard.

545
00:51:38,567 --> 00:51:40,459
He's too afraid to show his face.

546
00:51:40,486 --> 00:51:43,457
Maybe then Madame Suliman
will finally give up on me.

547
00:51:43,489 --> 00:51:46,062
Who's Madame Suliman?

548
00:51:48,828 --> 00:51:50,452
You're wearing that hat?

549
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:52,957
After all the magic I used
to make your dress pretty?

550
00:51:52,957 --> 00:51:56,373
Take care of him, Markl.

551
00:51:56,502 --> 00:51:58,744
Good luck.

552
00:52:05,219 --> 00:52:08,754
This charm will guarantee
your safe return.

553
00:52:10,182 --> 00:52:13,516
Don't worry. I'll follow
behind you in disguise.

554
00:52:13,644 --> 00:52:15,352
Now. Off you go.

555
00:52:23,112 --> 00:52:26,278
Why do I feel like this
is not going to work?

556
00:52:34,164 --> 00:52:38,244
I wonder what Howl disguised
himself as. Surely not a crow.

557
00:52:44,716 --> 00:52:48,451
Can't be a pigeon too. He's
too flamboyant for that.

558
00:52:52,849 --> 00:52:55,091
That could be him.

559
00:53:06,488 --> 00:53:09,773
Look how far I still have to go.

560
00:53:18,541 --> 00:53:21,626
Come on! Step right!

561
00:53:51,032 --> 00:53:54,366
Howl? You disguised
yourself as an old dog?

562
00:53:59,999 --> 00:54:02,953
You couldn't think of something
a bit more useful?

563
00:54:03,086 --> 00:54:05,707
Do you know how hard it is
to do things when you're old?

564
00:54:07,965 --> 00:54:09,792
Look who's here.

565
00:54:09,926 --> 00:54:12,011
The tacky little girl
from the hat shop.

566
00:54:12,011 --> 00:54:13,755
The Witch of the Waste.

567
00:54:13,888 --> 00:54:17,091
Thank you for handing my
scorching love note to Howl.

568
00:54:19,185 --> 00:54:21,474
How's he doing, by the way?

569
00:54:21,604 --> 00:54:23,229
He's acting like a big baby.

570
00:54:23,356 --> 00:54:26,357
And he's working me to the
bone as his cleaning lady.

571
00:54:26,484 --> 00:54:29,983
How delightful.

572
00:54:30,112 --> 00:54:34,241
So, tell me what business do
you have here at the palace?

573
00:54:34,367 --> 00:54:37,071
Job hunting.
I'm sick of working for Howl.

574
00:54:37,203 --> 00:54:38,994
And what about yourself?

575
00:54:39,121 --> 00:54:41,957
I received a royal invitation.

576
00:54:42,083 --> 00:54:46,994
That idiot Suliman finally realized
how much she needs my powers.

577
00:54:47,129 --> 00:54:50,545
If you're so great, why don't
you break the spell you put on me?

578
00:54:50,675 --> 00:54:52,169
I'm sorry, dear.

579
00:54:52,259 --> 00:54:56,506
My talent lies in casting spells,
not breaking them.

580
00:54:56,639 --> 00:54:58,596
Bye, Granny.

581
00:54:59,350 --> 00:55:00,976
Now, just wait a minute!

582
00:55:00,976 --> 00:55:03,811
You get back here right now!

583
00:55:03,938 --> 00:55:06,974
If I didn't have you to worry about,
I would have clobbered her.

584
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:26,285
What on earth is
wrong with you two?

585
00:55:26,377 --> 00:55:29,828
Sorry, ma'am. Vehicles are
prohibited beyond this point.

586
00:55:29,963 --> 00:55:31,707
You must continue on foot.

587
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,085
That Suliman,

588
00:55:33,217 --> 00:55:37,464
using her magic to force me to
climb all those god-forsaken stairs.

589
00:55:48,231 --> 00:55:50,023
Come on, Howl.

590
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:53,221
We can do this, just act natural.

591
00:56:16,593 --> 00:56:19,214
Howl, why are you so heavy?

592
00:56:29,022 --> 00:56:32,972
Wait. Help. I can't make it.

593
00:56:33,109 --> 00:56:35,268
What'd you say?

594
00:56:35,403 --> 00:56:38,986
You suddenly remembered how
to break the spell you put on me?

595
00:56:39,115 --> 00:56:40,989
I told you.

596
00:56:41,117 --> 00:56:43,988
I don't know how..

597
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,113
Then start studying.

598
00:56:51,044 --> 00:56:53,001
I don't get it.

599
00:56:53,129 --> 00:56:55,916
Where does she get
all that energy?

600
00:57:03,515 --> 00:57:05,975
I have to rest a bit.

601
00:57:12,315 --> 00:57:15,269
Why don't you just give up?

602
00:57:15,401 --> 00:57:16,682
You're killing yourself.

603
00:57:16,778 --> 00:57:18,735
I've waited....

604
00:57:18,863 --> 00:57:22,232
...for 50 years now
to be invited here.

605
00:57:22,367 --> 00:57:24,952
Ever since that Suliman....

606
00:57:24,952 --> 00:57:27,241
...banished me to live
in the Wastes.

607
00:57:27,371 --> 00:57:28,949
Well, good luck then.

608
00:57:29,081 --> 00:57:32,930
Too bad I'm not younger,
or I'd lend you a hand.

609
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,752
Come on, Howl.

610
00:57:35,797 --> 00:57:38,007
You cold-hearted old hag.

611
00:57:38,007 --> 00:57:40,676
Next time, I'll turn
you senile too.

612
00:58:01,697 --> 00:58:04,069
Almost there!

613
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,904
Honored guest, please follow me.

614
00:58:07,036 --> 00:58:09,609
You should go help her
get up these stairs.

615
00:58:09,747 --> 00:58:13,013
I am strictly forbidden
to offer such assistance.

616
00:58:13,042 --> 00:58:16,511
Why? That's so rude.
The King himself invited her.

617
00:58:16,545 --> 00:58:19,353
Come on! Let go!

618
00:58:20,007 --> 00:58:21,518
Don't give up now!

619
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:24,059
Are you a witch
or aren't you?

620
00:58:25,554 --> 00:58:27,777
Just shut up.

621
00:58:29,975 --> 00:58:32,568
What happened?
You look so much older.

622
00:58:32,603 --> 00:58:36,685
Mrs. Pendragon and
the Witch of the Waste!

623
00:58:38,108 --> 00:58:43,058
Pull yourself together. Isn't this
what you've been waiting for?

624
00:58:45,073 --> 00:58:48,442
Mrs. Pendragon and
the Witch of the Waste!

625
00:58:48,535 --> 00:58:50,492
Your name's Pendragon?

626
00:58:50,621 --> 00:58:52,412
Why does that name
sound so familiar?

627
00:58:52,539 --> 00:58:55,213
Because that was the
name of my tacky hat shop.

628
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:58,003
Don't you remember?
Is that what it was?

629
00:58:58,003 --> 00:59:00,920
Wait in here, please.

630
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:10,553
A chair! It's mine!

631
00:59:21,276 --> 00:59:24,111
Howl, get back here.

632
00:59:31,828 --> 00:59:33,536
This way please, ma'am.

633
01:00:11,868 --> 01:00:14,275
Thank you, Madame Suliman.

634
01:00:14,412 --> 01:00:16,369
Madame Suliman.

635
01:00:33,723 --> 01:00:35,965
So, you are Howl's mother,
are you?

636
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:38,971
Yes, I'm Mrs. Pendragon.

637
01:00:39,103 --> 01:00:41,974
You must be tired.
Please have a seat.

638
01:00:42,106 --> 01:00:43,684
Thank you.

639
01:00:53,075 --> 01:00:56,943
I am Madame Suliman,
His Majesty's head sorceress.

640
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,454
That's not your dog, is it?

641
01:01:04,587 --> 01:01:08,252
His name is Heen.
He's my errand dog.

642
01:01:08,382 --> 01:01:10,856
I had him escort you here.

643
01:01:14,013 --> 01:01:16,930
I take it Howl won't
be joining us?

644
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:20,935
He's such a lazy son,
he sent me instead.

645
01:01:21,061 --> 01:01:24,747
I'm afraid the king would
find him completely useless.

646
01:01:25,566 --> 01:01:27,938
I am very sorry to hear that.

647
01:01:28,068 --> 01:01:32,232
Howl was the last apprentice
I ever took on.

648
01:01:32,364 --> 01:01:35,449
I'd never seen such
a gifted student.

649
01:01:35,534 --> 01:01:37,942
I was so thrilled to have
finally found someone

650
01:01:38,078 --> 01:01:40,616
talented enough to replace me.

651
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:44,542
Then, one day, his heart
was stolen by a demon.

652
01:01:44,668 --> 01:01:46,993
He never returned to
complete his apprenticeship.

653
01:01:47,129 --> 01:01:48,374
And from that day forward,

654
01:01:48,505 --> 01:01:52,005
he has been using his magic
for entirely selfish reasons.

655
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,552
Mrs. Pendragon.
Yes?

656
01:01:55,679 --> 01:01:57,802
That boy is extremely dangerous.

657
01:01:57,931 --> 01:02:00,802
His powers are far too great
for someone without a heart.

658
01:02:02,853 --> 01:02:07,147
If he stays selfish, I'm afraid he'll
end up just like the Witch of the Waste.

659
01:02:07,274 --> 01:02:08,389
Send her in.

660
01:02:14,698 --> 01:02:16,572
What on earth happened to you?

661
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,410
I just restored her to
the age she actually is.

662
01:02:21,538 --> 01:02:23,495
All her powers are gone now.

663
01:02:23,623 --> 01:02:27,917
Once, she, too, was a magnificent
sorcerer with so much promise.

664
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:31,006
But then she fell prey
to a demon of greed

665
01:02:31,006 --> 01:02:34,624
who slowly consumed her,
body and soul.

666
01:02:34,759 --> 01:02:37,630
Our kingdom can no longer
afford to turn a blind eye

667
01:02:37,762 --> 01:02:40,170
to these disreputable
witches and wizards.

668
01:02:40,307 --> 01:02:44,653
If Howl reports to me and vows to
use his magic to serve the kingdom,

669
01:02:44,686 --> 01:02:47,277
I will show him how to
break from his demon.

670
01:02:47,313 --> 01:02:51,607
If not, I'll strip him of all
his powers. Just like her.

671
01:02:52,485 --> 01:02:54,827
That is enough!

672
01:02:54,863 --> 01:02:58,397
Now I understand why Howl was so
concerned about coming to see you.

673
01:02:58,533 --> 01:03:00,075
It's a trap.

674
01:03:00,201 --> 01:03:03,286
You lure people here with
an invitation from the king,

675
01:03:03,413 --> 01:03:06,248
and then you strip them
of all their powers.

676
01:03:06,332 --> 01:03:08,408
Howl would never be so heartless.

677
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:10,500
He may be selfish and cowardly,

678
01:03:10,628 --> 01:03:12,751
and sometimes he's
hard to understand,

679
01:03:12,881 --> 01:03:16,249
but his intentions are good.
He just wants to be free.

680
01:03:16,384 --> 01:03:19,301
Howl won't come here.
He doesn't need your help.

681
01:03:19,429 --> 01:03:21,920
He can fix his problem
with his demon on his own.

682
01:03:22,015 --> 01:03:24,256
I am certain of it.

683
01:03:24,392 --> 01:03:27,595
Now I understand.
You're in love with Howl.

684
01:03:27,729 --> 01:03:29,389
Howl?

685
01:03:29,522 --> 01:03:31,479
Did you say Howl's coming?

686
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:34,608
I want his heart,
his heart belongs to me!

687
01:03:34,694 --> 01:03:36,686
Stop that, just calm down.

688
01:03:36,821 --> 01:03:38,695
Howl is not coming here, OK?

689
01:03:39,907 --> 01:03:42,030
Oh, I think he will.

690
01:03:42,159 --> 01:03:46,537
I now know his weakness,
Mrs. Pendragon.

691
01:03:52,169 --> 01:03:55,005
Your Majesty.
As you were.

692
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:56,839
So then, how are you feeling?

693
01:03:56,966 --> 01:03:58,590
I'm fine, thank you.

694
01:03:58,718 --> 01:04:01,968
Thought I'd drop by rather than
sit through a dull war meeting.

695
01:04:02,054 --> 01:04:05,470
What an honor.
Who are your guests?

696
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:07,935
This is Howl's mother,
Mrs. Pendragon.

697
01:04:13,274 --> 01:04:14,685
Thanks for coming.

698
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:17,901
But I've decided not to
use magic to win this war.

699
01:04:18,028 --> 01:04:20,519
We have tried using
Madame Suliman's magic

700
01:04:20,656 --> 01:04:22,898
to shield our palace
from the enemy's bombs.

701
01:04:23,033 --> 01:04:25,655
But the bombs fall on
civilian homes instead.

702
01:04:25,786 --> 01:04:28,657
That's the problem with
magic. Right, Suliman?

703
01:04:28,789 --> 01:04:30,912
You're so eloquent today,
Your Majesty.

704
01:04:31,041 --> 01:04:32,535
Suliman!

705
01:04:35,212 --> 01:04:36,920
I've got a new battle plan.

706
01:04:37,047 --> 01:04:40,885
This time we're gonna
beat them to a pulp.

707
01:04:42,261 --> 01:04:44,930
Suliman, that's the best double
you've made of me yet.

708
01:04:45,013 --> 01:04:46,821
Keep up the good work.

709
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:47,880
Your Majesty.

710
01:04:48,017 --> 01:04:51,136
Get my generals assembled.
Sir.

711
01:04:53,981 --> 01:04:56,982
So nice to see you again, Howl.

712
01:04:57,109 --> 01:04:59,397
You're looking well,
Madame Suliman.

713
01:04:59,528 --> 01:05:01,900
Rather weak disguise.
Didn't I teach you better?

714
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:03,822
I'm not trying to outwit you.

715
01:05:03,949 --> 01:05:06,522
I kept my oath, I
reported when summoned.

716
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:08,403
Now Mother and I will go.

717
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:10,446
I'm afraid not.

718
01:05:30,892 --> 01:05:33,979
Now whatever you do,
don't look down.

719
01:05:33,979 --> 01:05:38,308
It's time to show your mother
what you really are, Howl.

720
01:06:31,828 --> 01:06:34,579
Stop, Howl, it's a trap!

721
01:06:47,135 --> 01:06:48,814
Hold on.

722
01:06:56,185 --> 01:06:59,637
Sophie, sit up here.

723
01:06:59,730 --> 01:07:02,684
Did you have to bring
those two with you?

724
01:07:04,527 --> 01:07:06,899
Nice doggie..

725
01:07:07,029 --> 01:07:10,979
I can't believe you
work for Suliman.

726
01:07:11,117 --> 01:07:12,990
I guess it's too late to toss him.

727
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:14,696
Sophie. Take the wheel.

728
01:07:14,829 --> 01:07:17,070
What? I can't fly,
are you kidding?

729
01:07:17,206 --> 01:07:18,997
They're gaining on us.

730
01:07:23,546 --> 01:07:27,394
I'll distract them, then you can fly this
thing back to my castle in the Wastes.

731
01:07:27,424 --> 01:07:28,968
How? I don't know the way.

732
01:07:28,968 --> 01:07:32,171
Hey, don't worry. The ring that
I gave you will guide you back home.

733
01:07:32,304 --> 01:07:34,932
All you have to do is summon
Calcifer with your heart.

734
01:07:34,932 --> 01:07:36,889
Calcifer?

735
01:07:39,645 --> 01:07:41,887
It's glowing!

736
01:07:42,022 --> 01:07:45,356
Just keep following that light and
you should be there before dark.

737
01:07:45,484 --> 01:07:48,620
I can't do this. Why did you make me 
come here if you were coming yourself?

738
01:07:48,654 --> 01:07:51,209
Knowing you'd be there gave
me the courage to show up.

739
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:54,009
That woman terrifies me,
I can't face her on my own.

740
01:07:54,034 --> 01:07:56,074
You saved me, Sophie.

741
01:07:56,203 --> 01:07:59,370
I was in big trouble back there.

742
01:07:59,498 --> 01:08:02,997
Don't let go!

743
01:08:08,632 --> 01:08:10,589
Wow. You're good.
Are you nuts?

744
01:08:12,553 --> 01:08:14,296
We've got a good lead now.

745
01:08:14,429 --> 01:08:18,664
I can give you 5 minutes of
invisibility, so use it wisely.

746
01:08:21,186 --> 01:08:22,894
Howl!

747
01:08:23,021 --> 01:08:24,765
Good luck!

748
01:08:34,741 --> 01:08:37,113
No, not now.

749
01:08:37,244 --> 01:08:38,619
Thank you.

750
01:08:38,745 --> 01:08:40,903
That was the most fun
I've had in ages.

751
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:43,874
I suppose Howl thinks
he's evaded me.

752
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,369
I bet his mother
can help me find him.

753
01:09:04,687 --> 01:09:06,136
Go!

754
01:09:37,595 --> 01:09:40,549
Almost there. That's my
hometown below us.

755
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:45,304
Don't try to be cute, dog.

756
01:09:45,436 --> 01:09:47,310
I'm still not going
to trust you.

757
01:10:11,045 --> 01:10:13,251
The castle is coming to meet us!

758
01:10:17,969 --> 01:10:20,257
Sophie! Here!

759
01:10:20,387 --> 01:10:22,012
Markl, help me!

760
01:10:22,139 --> 01:10:24,346
How am I supposed
to land this thing?

761
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:38,739
Sophie!

762
01:10:38,864 --> 01:10:41,153
Nice doggie..

763
01:10:41,283 --> 01:10:43,572
Markl!

764
01:10:43,702 --> 01:10:45,944
I'm home.

765
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,222
Are you hurt?

766
01:10:48,957 --> 01:10:50,368
I missed you.

767
01:10:50,501 --> 01:10:53,170
I missed you too.
Thanks for coming to meet us.

768
01:11:22,908 --> 01:11:26,491
This is bad. You've
gone too far, Howl.

769
01:11:44,971 --> 01:11:47,593
I wonder if Howl's back home.

770
01:12:41,945 --> 01:12:43,439
Howl?

771
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:47,007
Howl, is that you?

772
01:13:50,012 --> 01:13:52,384
Are you in pain?
Tell me what's happening.

773
01:13:52,514 --> 01:13:55,385
Go away.

774
01:13:55,517 --> 01:13:56,976
No, I'm not going away.

775
01:13:57,102 --> 01:13:59,854
I'm going to help you break
the spell that you're under.

776
01:14:00,981 --> 01:14:04,267
You... You can't even
break your own spell.

777
01:14:04,401 --> 01:14:06,857
But you don't understand.
I love you.

778
01:14:06,987 --> 01:14:09,478
You're too late.

779
01:14:12,701 --> 01:14:15,073
Howl! No!

780
01:14:26,965 --> 01:14:29,172
Calcifer, did Howl just get in?

781
01:14:29,301 --> 01:14:30,879
Yeah and he looks terrible.

782
01:14:31,011 --> 01:14:33,846
You better figure out how
to break the spell on us quick.

783
01:14:33,972 --> 01:14:36,380
Howl's running out of time,
I hope you realize that.

784
01:14:36,516 --> 01:14:39,434
You mean he'll become
a monster. Is that it?

785
01:14:39,561 --> 01:14:42,977
I can't tell you details of the curse,
lady. You should know that by now.

786
01:14:43,001 --> 01:14:44,732
Come on!

787
01:14:44,733 --> 01:14:46,943
Do you know what
Madame Suliman said?

788
01:14:46,943 --> 01:14:49,980
She said that Howl's heart
was stolen by a demon.

789
01:14:50,113 --> 01:14:51,905
Tell me now.
What do you know?

790
01:14:52,032 --> 01:14:55,068
I'm so sorry, but that would
be confidential information.

791
01:14:55,201 --> 01:14:57,989
What if I dump a bucket
of water on you?

792
01:14:58,121 --> 01:15:00,826
If you drown me,
then Howl will die too!

793
01:15:20,018 --> 01:15:21,927
Hi, Turnip-head.

794
01:15:22,061 --> 01:15:24,101
This isn't gonna be easy.

795
01:15:26,983 --> 01:15:29,556
OK. Ready!

796
01:15:29,694 --> 01:15:33,080
All right. Calcifer, 
open it wider.

797
01:15:33,114 --> 01:15:35,866
Here we go!

798
01:15:48,379 --> 01:15:51,665
I... said... move!

799
01:16:14,947 --> 01:16:19,443
If I just hang a little curtain here,
maybe Howl won't notice.

800
01:16:21,162 --> 01:16:23,653
Come on in, it's time to eat!

801
01:16:29,503 --> 01:16:31,413
Here. Want some more?

802
01:16:32,757 --> 01:16:35,461
Don't feed her! That's
the Witch of the Waste!

803
01:16:35,593 --> 01:16:37,003
She's all right.

804
01:16:37,136 --> 01:16:39,971
She keeps staring at me.
It's freaking me out.

805
01:16:40,097 --> 01:16:42,303
What a pretty fire.

806
01:16:44,602 --> 01:16:47,009
Howl! Hello.
Good morning, everyone.

807
01:16:47,146 --> 01:16:48,308
Glad you're home.

808
01:16:48,439 --> 01:16:50,478
Master Howl, we can
keep this dog, can't we?

809
01:16:50,566 --> 01:16:53,816
The Witch of the Waste
and Suliman's dog at my table.

810
01:16:53,944 --> 01:16:56,435
What possessed you to let
them in the house, Calcifer?

811
01:16:56,572 --> 01:16:57,983
I didn't let them in.

812
01:16:58,115 --> 01:17:00,950
Sophie crash-landed
her plane into my face.

813
01:17:03,621 --> 01:17:05,530
I knew she'd make
a great pilot.

814
01:17:05,664 --> 01:17:09,199
Looks like we have yet
another addition to the family.

815
01:17:09,335 --> 01:17:13,005
You've got quite a
nasty spell on you too.

816
01:17:13,005 --> 01:17:15,966
It seems everyone in
this family's got problems.

817
01:17:15,966 --> 01:17:18,338
What a handsome man.

818
01:17:18,469 --> 01:17:21,920
So. We've got a lot of
work to do. We're moving.

819
01:17:22,055 --> 01:17:23,799
Moving?
That's good.

820
01:17:23,932 --> 01:17:26,554
I'm sick of being stuck out here
in the middle of nowhere.

821
01:17:26,685 --> 01:17:30,350
Madame Suliman is hot on our trail,
so we're gonna have to hurry.

822
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,936
I'm afraid your spell is
too strong for this move.

823
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:34,940
You're gonna have
to stay behind.

824
01:17:40,824 --> 01:17:42,449
There. All done.

825
01:17:42,576 --> 01:17:45,660
All right, Calcifer, line her up.

826
01:17:59,926 --> 01:18:01,800
There. That should do it.

827
01:18:01,887 --> 01:18:03,760
Sit tight for a second.

828
01:18:06,975 --> 01:18:09,264
Be gentle with me, please.

829
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:13,772
On my mark.

830
01:18:57,984 --> 01:19:00,938
Moving's done. You
can get down now.

831
01:19:02,989 --> 01:19:05,361
This is great, Master Howl!
It's huge!

832
01:19:05,491 --> 01:19:08,860
What a pretty fire.

833
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:25,301
But this is...
I added on a bathroom

834
01:19:25,428 --> 01:19:28,132
since our family seems
to keep growing.

835
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:30,422
Come over here, Sophie.

836
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:36,308
I added another bedroom too.

837
01:19:36,439 --> 01:19:37,470
Have a look.

838
01:19:47,825 --> 01:19:49,652
Why'd you... do this?

839
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:51,861
So we'd have a room
that suited you.

840
01:19:51,996 --> 01:19:53,075
Do you like it?

841
01:19:54,582 --> 01:19:57,915
Of course. It's perfect
for a cleaning lady.

842
01:19:58,043 --> 01:20:01,044
I got you some new clothes too.
But you can open them later.

843
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:04,503
Come on, Sophie.
Look at this.

844
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:06,590
All right, a courtyard!

845
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:09,007
That shop's ours too.

846
01:20:09,138 --> 01:20:10,881
Heen! Come on!

847
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:13,137
See that new color on the dial?

848
01:20:13,267 --> 01:20:15,888
There's a new portal.

849
01:20:17,604 --> 01:20:20,890
It's a present for you.
Come see.

850
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,443
Oh!

851
01:20:45,799 --> 01:20:48,124
You like it? It's my
secret garden.

852
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:50,585
It's incredible.

853
01:20:51,638 --> 01:20:54,933
Did you use your
magic to make this?

854
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:58,267
Only a little, just to
help the flowers grow.

855
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:09,026
This place is gorgeous, Howl!

856
01:21:09,155 --> 01:21:11,362
It's like a dream.

857
01:21:34,347 --> 01:21:36,423
Sophie?

858
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:40,937
It all seems so familiar, yet I
know I've never been here before.

859
01:21:40,937 --> 01:21:43,262
I feel so at home.

860
01:21:43,398 --> 01:21:45,853
Come with me.
OK.

861
01:21:52,949 --> 01:21:55,866
Look there..

862
01:21:59,372 --> 01:22:03,417
What a cute cottage.
That was my secret hideaway.

863
01:22:03,543 --> 01:22:07,872
I spent a lot of time here
by myself when I was young.

864
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:10,750
You were alone?

865
01:22:10,842 --> 01:22:15,053
My uncle, who was a wizard, gave
me this place as my private study.

866
01:22:15,179 --> 01:22:18,614
And now you can come 
here whenever you like.

867
01:22:21,394 --> 01:22:22,722
What's the matter?

868
01:22:22,853 --> 01:22:24,981
It's... You're scaring me.

869
01:22:24,981 --> 01:22:27,602
I have this weird feeling
that you're going to leave.

870
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:32,530
Howl, tell me what's going on.

871
01:22:32,655 --> 01:22:35,656
Please. I don't care
if you're a monster.

872
01:22:40,913 --> 01:22:44,762
I'm just setting things up so that all of
you can live a comfortable life, Sophie.

873
01:22:44,792 --> 01:22:46,950
With all the flowers
you've got in this valley,

874
01:22:47,044 --> 01:22:49,351
you could easily
open up a flower shop.

875
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:52,085
Right? I'm sure
you'd be good at it.

876
01:22:52,216 --> 01:22:54,458
So, you are going away?

877
01:22:55,386 --> 01:22:58,969
Please, Howl, I know
I can be of help to you.

878
01:22:59,098 --> 01:23:03,445
Even though I'm not pretty
and all I'm good at is cleaning.

879
01:23:03,477 --> 01:23:06,478
Sophie! Sophie,
you're beautiful!

880
01:23:09,983 --> 01:23:14,195
Well, the nice thing about being old
is you've got nothing much to lose.

881
01:23:27,209 --> 01:23:30,245
What is that thing doing
out  here? A battleship?

882
01:23:30,379 --> 01:23:32,206
Still looking for more
cities to burn.

883
01:23:32,339 --> 01:23:34,332
Is it the enemy's
or one of ours?

884
01:23:34,466 --> 01:23:36,293
What difference does it make?

885
01:23:48,397 --> 01:23:49,891
Those stupid murderers.

886
01:23:56,947 --> 01:23:59,901
We can't just let them
fly off with all those bombs.

887
01:24:15,924 --> 01:24:18,960
What's happening?
What did you do?

888
01:24:19,094 --> 01:24:22,581
Just messed with it.
It won't crash though.

889
01:24:24,307 --> 01:24:26,099
Howl!

890
01:24:26,226 --> 01:24:28,895
Here they come.

891
01:24:38,154 --> 01:24:41,772
Those things are Suliman's
henchmen. Let's go.

892
01:24:41,908 --> 01:24:44,779
Faster! We need to take off!

893
01:24:57,965 --> 01:24:59,543
All right, you're going in.

894
01:24:59,676 --> 01:25:01,964
No! Don't let go!

895
01:25:10,561 --> 01:25:12,471
Sophie, what happened?

896
01:25:12,605 --> 01:25:15,476
I'm too old to be
treated like this!

897
01:25:24,367 --> 01:25:28,993
Good night, Sophie.
Good night, Markl.

898
01:25:30,623 --> 01:25:32,781
Don't worry about Master
Howl, Sophie.

899
01:25:32,917 --> 01:25:34,956
Sometimes he likes to
go away for days on end.

900
01:25:35,086 --> 01:25:37,577
Thank you.
That's good to know.

901
01:25:37,713 --> 01:25:40,085
Need anything else?
No, I'm fine.

902
01:25:40,216 --> 01:25:42,339
Well. Good night then.

903
01:25:42,468 --> 01:25:43,748
You're in love.

904
01:25:46,222 --> 01:25:49,887
Don't deny it.
You've been sighing all day.

905
01:25:59,985 --> 01:26:03,401
Just as I thought.

906
01:26:03,531 --> 01:26:05,950
Have you ever been
in love before?

907
01:26:05,950 --> 01:26:08,904
Of course I have.
I'm still in love.

908
01:26:10,245 --> 01:26:13,531
Strapping, young men
are so difficult to deal with.

909
01:26:13,666 --> 01:26:16,121
But their hearts, I just adore.

910
01:26:16,251 --> 01:26:18,125
You're terrible.

911
01:26:18,253 --> 01:26:20,542
And they're so cute too.

912
01:26:22,257 --> 01:26:25,709
What's that?

913
01:26:25,844 --> 01:26:27,504
It's an air raid siren.

914
01:26:28,472 --> 01:26:30,168
Air raid?

915
01:26:30,641 --> 01:26:32,135
It's a long way's off.

916
01:26:32,267 --> 01:26:34,972
But you better not go
outside tonight, dear.

917
01:26:35,896 --> 01:26:40,225
I'm sure Suliman's henchmen are
looking everywhere for this place.

918
01:26:43,612 --> 01:26:45,735
What a good fire.

919
01:26:45,864 --> 01:26:47,904
He keeps this house
so well hidden.

920
01:27:22,943 --> 01:27:26,060
Sophie, there's a
strange lady in here!

921
01:27:32,911 --> 01:27:34,239
Mother?

922
01:27:34,371 --> 01:27:36,862
Sophie!

923
01:27:38,958 --> 01:27:42,012
Thank goodness you're here!
I searched everywhere for you!

924
01:27:42,045 --> 01:27:44,915
My, look at your face,
you're so old!

925
01:27:45,048 --> 01:27:47,918
Everyone's saying it's
my fault that you left!

926
01:27:48,051 --> 01:27:52,594
You'll forgive me,
won't you? Sophie!

927
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:54,056
Mother.

928
01:27:56,392 --> 01:27:59,263
I barely recognize the place.

929
01:27:59,395 --> 01:28:02,729
Who is that woman?
The landlady?

930
01:28:02,857 --> 01:28:06,273
I forgot to tell you!
I got married again!

931
01:28:06,402 --> 01:28:09,024
He's such a nice man
and he's filthy rich too,

932
01:28:09,155 --> 01:28:11,112
so we can all live together again!

933
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:13,951
You won't have to work
as a cleaning lady anymore.

934
01:28:13,951 --> 01:28:17,783
That's all right, Mother.
I actually like living here.

935
01:28:17,914 --> 01:28:20,405
Really?  I forgot!

936
01:28:20,541 --> 01:28:23,032
I've got a car waiting.
I've gotta run.

937
01:28:23,169 --> 01:28:26,419
Sophie, I'm so glad
I found you.

938
01:28:40,937 --> 01:28:45,100
A peeping bug? Can't
Suliman do better than that?

939
01:28:45,232 --> 01:28:46,976
Open wide, Cal.

940
01:28:55,993 --> 01:28:58,780
I hope you and your new
husband will be very happy.

941
01:28:58,913 --> 01:29:02,198
Thank you, Sophie. Bye.
Bye, Mother.

942
01:29:05,586 --> 01:29:08,789
I did what I was told.
Now take me to my husband.

943
01:29:08,923 --> 01:29:12,777
Yes, ma'am. I'm sure Madame
Suliman will be very pleased with you.

944
01:29:14,011 --> 01:29:15,929
Forgive me, Sophie.

945
01:29:19,975 --> 01:29:21,386
Wow. Look at all of them.

946
01:29:21,518 --> 01:29:25,183
If they keep leaving at this rate,
the town will soon be empty.

947
01:29:25,314 --> 01:29:28,331
Do you wanna leave
too, Sophie? What?

948
01:29:28,359 --> 01:29:31,080
That lady said she wants
you to live with her now.

949
01:29:31,111 --> 01:29:34,694
Yes, well, at least she
cared enough to visit.

950
01:29:34,823 --> 01:29:37,112
Don't leave, Sophie.

951
01:29:37,201 --> 01:29:40,036
I love you. You have to stay.

952
01:29:41,288 --> 01:29:44,159
I love you too, Markl.

953
01:29:44,291 --> 01:29:45,702
I'll stay.

954
01:29:45,834 --> 01:29:47,708
Really?

955
01:29:47,836 --> 01:29:49,378
Because we're a family now.

956
01:29:49,505 --> 01:29:51,378
Yes, we're a family.

957
01:29:51,507 --> 01:29:53,380
Thank you, Sophie.

958
01:30:01,183 --> 01:30:04,667
I'll never let Suliman
get a hold of Howl.

959
01:30:21,036 --> 01:30:23,159
But the newspaper
says we won.

960
01:30:23,288 --> 01:30:27,120
Only idiots believe what
they read in the paper.

961
01:30:27,250 --> 01:30:30,921
That's so strange.
I can't get Calcifer going.

962
01:30:30,921 --> 01:30:33,376
Do you have to keep
smoking that?

963
01:30:33,506 --> 01:30:35,298
It smells terrible.

964
01:30:35,425 --> 01:30:38,046
Don't deny an old witch
her pleasures, young lady.

965
01:30:38,178 --> 01:30:40,633
Markl, will you crack
a window, please?

966
01:30:44,267 --> 01:30:47,019
I wouldn't open that window,
if I were you, dear.

967
01:30:48,063 --> 01:30:51,313
Calcifer's too weak right now
to protect this place.

968
01:30:51,399 --> 01:30:53,226
Suliman's henchmen could get in.

969
01:30:54,319 --> 01:30:56,988
Markl!

970
01:31:06,581 --> 01:31:08,573
Get back!

971
01:31:14,088 --> 01:31:15,997
Markl, get back inside.

972
01:31:16,132 --> 01:31:18,041
I'm going to check
on the shop.

973
01:31:35,693 --> 01:31:37,567
There are bombs falling on us!

974
01:31:37,695 --> 01:31:41,230
Why can't you put out
some fires instead?

975
01:32:04,972 --> 01:32:06,514
Howl! No!

976
01:32:19,403 --> 01:32:21,027
This is exciting.

977
01:32:33,751 --> 01:32:35,209
Howl!

978
01:32:37,254 --> 01:32:39,745
I'm sorry, Sophie. I
should've gotten here sooner.

979
01:32:39,882 --> 01:32:43,464
You're alive! Thank goodness!

980
01:32:59,985 --> 01:33:03,069
Master Howl! Sophie!
You're OK!

981
01:33:04,489 --> 01:33:06,233
Calcifer.

982
01:33:06,366 --> 01:33:08,489
You hang in there now.

983
01:33:12,748 --> 01:33:17,125
Tell me, was that cigar a gift from
Madame Suliman by any chance?

984
01:33:17,252 --> 01:33:20,585
Howl, she fed me something
gross. I feel sick.

985
01:33:20,714 --> 01:33:23,584
Why, if it isn't Howl.

986
01:33:23,717 --> 01:33:27,928
I think you and I need to have
a nice, long, heart-to-heart chat.

987
01:33:28,054 --> 01:33:32,218
There's nothing I'd like more than that,
but right now there's a war going on.

988
01:33:33,185 --> 01:33:36,933
How unlike you, Howl,
not running away anymore.

989
01:33:37,063 --> 01:33:39,156
Until later then.

990
01:33:39,190 --> 01:33:42,441
Stay here. Calcifer will
protect you from the henchmen.

991
01:33:42,569 --> 01:33:44,277
I'll stand guard out front.

992
01:33:46,114 --> 01:33:50,408
No, wait! Howl! Don't go out
there. It's too dangerous.

993
01:33:50,535 --> 01:33:52,113
Another wave's coming.

994
01:33:52,245 --> 01:33:54,238
And Calcifer's too weak
to stop the bombs.

995
01:33:54,372 --> 01:33:56,661
Let's run! Don't fight
them, Howl.

996
01:33:56,791 --> 01:33:59,745
Sorry. I've had enough
of running away, Sophie.

997
01:33:59,836 --> 01:34:05,477
And now I've got something
I want to protect. It's you.

998
01:34:09,262 --> 01:34:10,590
Come back!

999
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:36,637
There's where we are,
at the shop.

1000
01:35:40,853 --> 01:35:42,347
Looks like Howl's in trouble.

1001
01:35:51,738 --> 01:35:52,901
Howl, look out!

1002
01:36:01,999 --> 01:36:04,786
What's going on? Turnip!

1003
01:36:08,380 --> 01:36:10,419
Markl, I need your help.

1004
01:36:10,549 --> 01:36:13,419
Are you crazy? I can't move
the portals without Howl's help.

1005
01:36:13,552 --> 01:36:16,930
You have to try. If we don't break away, 
Howl will keep protecting the hat shop.

1006
01:36:16,930 --> 01:36:18,932
I'd preferred him as a coward.

1007
01:36:18,932 --> 01:36:22,266
OK, we have to go now.
Are we going for a stroll?

1008
01:36:22,394 --> 01:36:24,683
We can't do that. It'll
make us too vulnerable!

1009
01:36:24,813 --> 01:36:25,975
We already are.

1010
01:36:26,106 --> 01:36:28,531
And if we don't move quick,
Howl doesn't have a chance.

1011
01:36:28,567 --> 01:36:31,105
Sophie! They're about
to bomb the hat shop!

1012
01:36:31,194 --> 01:36:33,401
Quick. Help her
get outside, OK?

1013
01:36:33,530 --> 01:36:34,989
Right.

1014
01:36:36,366 --> 01:36:38,240
You're coming with us.
Hop on.

1015
01:36:38,368 --> 01:36:39,946
I can't! It's impossible!

1016
01:36:40,078 --> 01:36:42,236
No one but Howl can
take me out of this hearth.

1017
01:36:42,372 --> 01:36:45,343
There's no time to lose, Calcifer.
We have to try something.

1018
01:36:45,375 --> 01:36:47,266
Don't do this!
No, no!

1019
01:36:47,293 --> 01:36:49,666
Help, help, crazy lady with a shovel!

1020
01:36:49,754 --> 01:36:52,839
If you take me out that door,
the castle could collapse.

1021
01:36:52,966 --> 01:36:54,415
Good!

1022
01:36:57,470 --> 01:36:59,178
We're ready.
OK, step back.

1023
01:36:59,305 --> 01:37:01,345
Make sure I go out last,
Sophie.

1024
01:37:01,474 --> 01:37:06,751
I don't know what's gonna happen,
but I'm sure it won't be good.

1025
01:37:34,007 --> 01:37:38,087
I told you it would collapse.
Rain! Rain!

1026
01:37:40,805 --> 01:37:42,085
That ship's headed for town!

1027
01:37:42,223 --> 01:37:43,966
Markl, look after her, OK?

1028
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:45,973
Turnip-head, help me
find a way back in.

1029
01:37:46,811 --> 01:37:50,363
Don't you worry now, ma'am,
I'm gonna take good care of you.

1030
01:37:52,441 --> 01:37:54,268
Markl, here's a way in!

1031
01:38:04,287 --> 01:38:07,056
Watch, the roof's leaking.
Don't let me get wet!

1032
01:38:07,081 --> 01:38:08,556
Hold on for a second.

1033
01:38:08,582 --> 01:38:11,252
It's wet here, Sophie!

1034
01:38:11,377 --> 01:38:15,327
Too damp, too damp,
very damp here!

1035
01:38:15,464 --> 01:38:16,839
Hurry! Hurry!

1036
01:38:16,966 --> 01:38:18,839
Hurry, please!

1037
01:38:26,016 --> 01:38:27,559
Markl, hurry, get inside.

1038
01:38:27,685 --> 01:38:29,724
The castle's a wreck.

1039
01:38:29,853 --> 01:38:33,104
Told you we should've stayed put.
Howl and I could have handled it.

1040
01:38:35,526 --> 01:38:38,396
We have to tell Howl we're not
attached to the hat shop now.

1041
01:38:38,529 --> 01:38:40,521
Move the castle and
take us to Howl.

1042
01:38:40,656 --> 01:38:42,530
What?

1043
01:38:42,658 --> 01:38:46,525
I know you can do it. I've
never seen a fire with more spark.

1044
01:38:46,662 --> 01:38:50,362
But there's no chimney here
and I keep getting dripped on.

1045
01:38:50,499 --> 01:38:52,010
And the wood's all damp.

1046
01:38:52,042 --> 01:38:54,431
They say that the
best blaze brightest

1047
01:38:54,461 --> 01:38:56,969
when circumstances
are at their worst.

1048
01:38:57,005 --> 01:38:59,413
Yeah, but no one really
believes that.

1049
01:38:59,550 --> 01:39:01,108
Come on, let's be honest.

1050
01:39:01,135 --> 01:39:04,568
What a pretty fire.
Why don't you have a seat.

1051
01:39:04,596 --> 01:39:07,597
All right. I need something
of yours, Sophie.

1052
01:39:07,724 --> 01:39:08,987
Why's that?

1053
01:39:09,017 --> 01:39:11,525
I can't do it by myself.
How about your eyes?

1054
01:39:11,561 --> 01:39:15,227
How about this?

1055
01:40:19,754 --> 01:40:22,327
Thanks, Calcifer.
You're fantastic!

1056
01:40:22,465 --> 01:40:25,715
Imagine what I could've done
with your eyes. Or your heart.

1057
01:40:25,843 --> 01:40:28,963
That's it! You've
got Howl's heart!

1058
01:40:31,224 --> 01:40:33,347
I found it!

1059
01:40:45,238 --> 01:40:48,192
I can see Howl down there.
Looks like he's trapped!

1060
01:40:52,328 --> 01:40:55,697
Calcifer, hurry!

1061
01:40:55,831 --> 01:40:57,917
No!

1062
01:40:57,917 --> 01:40:59,197
Put it back!

1063
01:40:59,335 --> 01:41:01,873
Let go!

1064
01:41:02,004 --> 01:41:04,958
Howl's heart, it's mine!

1065
01:41:15,643 --> 01:41:17,018
Put it back now!

1066
01:41:19,271 --> 01:41:20,981
It's hot!

1067
01:41:20,981 --> 01:41:23,021
It's burning me!
Let go!

1068
01:41:23,150 --> 01:41:25,107
You're catching on fire!

1069
01:41:25,236 --> 01:41:27,109
No, it's mine.

1070
01:41:27,238 --> 01:41:31,864
It's mine! It's mine!

1071
01:41:45,005 --> 01:41:47,164
Sophie!

1072
01:41:50,803 --> 01:41:53,757
Sophie!
Sophie ruined it!

1073
01:41:53,889 --> 01:41:56,214
My heart's ruined!

1074
01:42:39,518 --> 01:42:43,052
Heen, what have I done?
I poured water on Calcifer!

1075
01:42:45,357 --> 01:42:48,358
What if I killed Howl too?

1076
01:43:15,053 --> 01:43:17,970
It's moving. Is Howl still alive?

1077
01:43:18,097 --> 01:43:20,220
Can you lead me to him?

1078
01:43:41,454 --> 01:43:43,493
The front door.

1079
01:45:01,408 --> 01:45:02,867
Heen.

1080
01:45:37,152 --> 01:45:39,109
That's Howl.

1081
01:45:57,505 --> 01:46:01,359
I know where I am.
I'm in Howl's childhood.

1082
01:47:19,086 --> 01:47:21,328
Howl! Calcifer!

1083
01:47:22,965 --> 01:47:24,958
It's me, Sophie!

1084
01:47:25,092 --> 01:47:27,049
I know how to help you now.

1085
01:47:27,928 --> 01:47:31,297
Find me in the future!

1086
01:48:03,047 --> 01:48:06,415
Sorry, Heen. I'm trying to hurry.

1087
01:48:06,508 --> 01:48:08,501
I just can't seem
to stop crying.

1088
01:48:32,993 --> 01:48:34,191
Howl.

1089
01:48:40,667 --> 01:48:43,621
I'm sorry. Did I come too late?

1090
01:48:43,753 --> 01:48:47,372
I didn't mean to make
you wait this long.

1091
01:48:50,677 --> 01:48:53,963
I need you to take me
to Calcifer if you can.

1092
01:49:56,743 --> 01:49:59,827
He's dead?
No, Markl.

1093
01:50:03,875 --> 01:50:05,250
Howl needs that back now.

1094
01:50:05,376 --> 01:50:06,919
Don't look at me.
I don't have it.

1095
01:50:06,919 --> 01:50:09,457
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1096
01:50:09,547 --> 01:50:10,661
Please.

1097
01:50:12,258 --> 01:50:14,297
Please give it back.

1098
01:50:17,013 --> 01:50:19,883
You really want it that badly?

1099
01:50:20,016 --> 01:50:21,976
Yes.

1100
01:50:21,976 --> 01:50:23,684
All right then.

1101
01:50:23,811 --> 01:50:26,267
You'd better take
good care of it. OK.

1102
01:50:26,397 --> 01:50:28,970
Here, dear.

1103
01:50:29,066 --> 01:50:31,522
Thank you, you have
a big heart.

1104
01:50:47,126 --> 01:50:49,035
Calcifer.

1105
01:50:50,171 --> 01:50:52,578
Sophie, I'm so tired.

1106
01:50:52,715 --> 01:50:56,314
If I give Howl back his heart,
what will happen to you?

1107
01:50:56,343 --> 01:50:58,917
I'll be OK if you do it.
I think.

1108
01:50:59,054 --> 01:51:03,863
I mean you dumped water on me
and Howl and I both survived.

1109
01:51:03,892 --> 01:51:05,932
I better try then.

1110
01:51:08,689 --> 01:51:11,974
It's so warm and
fluttering like a bird.

1111
01:51:12,067 --> 01:51:14,523
It's still just the heart of a child.

1112
01:51:15,320 --> 01:51:18,321
Please, help Calcifer live.

1113
01:51:18,449 --> 01:51:21,782
And please help Howl
take back his heart.

1114
01:51:33,881 --> 01:51:36,122
I'm alive! I'm alive!
Look, I'm free!

1115
01:51:36,258 --> 01:51:40,469
Free! Free! I'm alive!

1116
01:51:42,597 --> 01:51:44,804
He moved! See?

1117
01:51:48,979 --> 01:51:51,136
It can't stand without Calcifer!

1118
01:52:06,037 --> 01:52:07,386
Turnip!

1119
01:52:19,467 --> 01:52:20,926
His pole snapped.

1120
01:52:21,052 --> 01:52:23,424
Are you all right?
We'll get you a new pole, OK?

1121
01:52:25,974 --> 01:52:28,512
You saved us, Turnip.

1122
01:52:36,025 --> 01:52:37,567
Thank you, Sophie.

1123
01:52:37,694 --> 01:52:40,813
I'm the prince who's been missing
from the neighboring kingdom.

1124
01:52:40,905 --> 01:52:43,112
Somehow I got that
blasted spell put on me.

1125
01:52:43,241 --> 01:52:46,776
I know that spell. A kiss
from your true love breaks it.

1126
01:52:46,911 --> 01:52:48,913
That's right. If it
weren't for Sophie,

1127
01:52:48,913 --> 01:52:51,404
I would have been a scarecrow
for the rest of my life.

1128
01:52:51,541 --> 01:52:53,866
My, what a strapping
young man you are.

1129
01:52:54,001 --> 01:52:56,290
What's going on?
What am I doing here?

1130
01:52:56,421 --> 01:53:00,205
I feel terrible, like there's
a weight on my chest.

1131
01:53:00,341 --> 01:53:02,879
A heart's a heavy burden.

1132
01:53:03,011 --> 01:53:06,842
Wow! Sophie, your hair
looks just like starlight.

1133
01:53:06,973 --> 01:53:08,467
It's beautiful.

1134
01:53:08,599 --> 01:53:11,269
You think so? So do l!

1135
01:53:13,062 --> 01:53:15,814
It looks like your true love
is in love with someone else.

1136
01:53:15,940 --> 01:53:19,475
You should go home anyway and
tell your king to stop this dumb war.

1137
01:53:19,610 --> 01:53:21,188
Yes, that's exactly what I'll do.

1138
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:24,570
One thing you can always
count on is that hearts change.

1139
01:53:24,699 --> 01:53:27,486
So as soon as this war
is over, I shall return.

1140
01:53:27,618 --> 01:53:30,109
I love it when you
talk like that.

1141
01:53:30,246 --> 01:53:32,951
I'll look forward to your
return, big boy.

1142
01:53:39,505 --> 01:53:40,965
There you are.

1143
01:53:40,965 --> 01:53:43,372
You should have
checked in earlier.

1144
01:53:43,509 --> 01:53:45,418
What on earth were you up to?

1145
01:53:48,472 --> 01:53:50,880
Howl found his true love.

1146
01:53:51,016 --> 01:53:53,554
You little traitor.

1147
01:53:58,065 --> 01:54:01,766
The game is over.

1148
01:54:01,902 --> 01:54:05,947
Get me the Prime Minister
and the Minister of Defense.

1149
01:54:06,073 --> 01:54:08,860
It's time to put an end
to this idiotic war.

1150
01:54:08,993 --> 01:54:10,041
Yes, ma'am.

1151
01:54:10,077 --> 01:54:12,533
Hey, it's Calcifer!

1152
01:54:12,663 --> 01:54:15,201
You didn't have to
come back, Calcifer.

1153
01:54:17,668 --> 01:54:19,210
I kind of missed you guys.

1154
01:54:19,336 --> 01:54:20,914
And it looks like
it's gonna rain.

1155
01:54:21,046 --> 01:54:24,047
I missed you too, Calcifer.

1156
01:54:24,174 --> 01:54:26,118
Wow!
