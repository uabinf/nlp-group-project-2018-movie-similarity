1
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:39,755
All right.
Off you go.

2
00:02:39,756 --> 00:02:40,890
Happy Christmas, teacher!

3
00:02:40,891 --> 00:02:43,222
- Happy new year.
- Thank you, Dave.

4
00:02:43,223 --> 00:02:44,722
Give my love to your
girlfriend in Sydney, sir.

5
00:02:44,723 --> 00:02:46,689
I'll do that, sir, thank you.

6
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,256
Have a happy holiday, sir.

7
00:02:48,257 --> 00:02:50,523
And you, Chris, thank you.
Enjoy yourself.

8
00:02:50,524 --> 00:02:51,890
For your collection, sir.

9
00:02:51,891 --> 00:02:53,210
Thank you very much, Lou.
Bye-bye.

10
00:02:55,825 --> 00:02:57,891
So I'll see you
next year, mate.

11
00:06:16,222 --> 00:06:17,629
Shut up!

12
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:28,378
A middy, please, Charlie.

13
00:06:50,355 --> 00:06:51,621
Having one yourself?

14
00:06:51,622 --> 00:06:52,642
Yeah.

15
00:07:13,621 --> 00:07:14,520
You've, uh,

16
00:07:15,888 --> 00:07:17,588
got snakes in your
pocket, have you?

17
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:26,790
Mmm...

18
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:28,688
Keys.

19
00:07:40,355 --> 00:07:43,223
Will you be wanting your
room when you come back?

20
00:07:44,222 --> 00:07:45,288
Where else would I stay?

21
00:07:58,553 --> 00:08:00,620
But if you get

22
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:02,353
a flood of tourists
or anything, Charlie,

23
00:08:02,354 --> 00:08:03,792
I can always stay
in the schoolhouse.

24
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:24,222
See you in six weeks, huh?

25
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,255
Not if I can rob a bank.

26
00:08:29,253 --> 00:08:31,622
- Sure, Ned Kelly.
- Mmm.

27
00:08:36,554 --> 00:08:37,620
See you, then.

28
00:08:37,621 --> 00:08:38,520
Uh-huh.

29
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,220
Excuse me, please.

30
00:09:21,221 --> 00:09:21,919
Oi, fella, come and
have a beer with us.

31
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,819
No. No, thanks.

32
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,019
Come on, come and have a beer.

33
00:11:15,218 --> 00:11:16,219
New to the yabba?

34
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,120
Yes.

35
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:18,820
Staying long?

36
00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:21,250
No, just tonight.

37
00:11:21,251 --> 00:11:23,351
Oh, that's hard luck.

38
00:11:23,352 --> 00:11:25,787
Want to see a bit more
of the yabba than that.

39
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,516
You think it's worth seeing?

40
00:11:28,517 --> 00:11:30,249
It's the
best place in Australia.

41
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,786
Everybody likes the yabba.

42
00:11:31,787 --> 00:11:32,887
Why?

43
00:11:33,886 --> 00:11:35,985
Well, it's a friendly place.

44
00:11:36,984 --> 00:11:40,750
Nobody worries who you are
or where you come from.

45
00:11:40,751 --> 00:11:43,108
You're a good bloke, you're all right.
You know what I mean?

46
00:11:56,652 --> 00:11:58,783
Excuse me.

47
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:01,887
Do you have a room for John Grant?
I made a booking by letter.

48
00:12:04,884 --> 00:12:06,350
Oh, I'm only staying the night.

49
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,749
I'm flying to
Sydney in the morning.

50
00:12:07,918 --> 00:12:09,352
You have to pay now.

51
00:12:10,351 --> 00:12:11,916
I think we can manage that.

52
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:12,816
It'll be $4.

53
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,950
There's $1 deposit on the keys.

54
00:12:28,951 --> 00:12:30,909
You'll get that back when
you bring the keys back.

55
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,359
Thank you.

56
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:43,516
Could you tell me where
room seven is, please?

57
00:12:43,517 --> 00:12:45,996
Up the steps and down
the corridor to the right.

58
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,529
Hey. Shut it, mate.
We're closed.

59
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,249
Excuse me.

60
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,648
You're new to the yabba?

61
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:27,747
Well, I just dropped
in for the night.

62
00:14:27,748 --> 00:14:28,816
I'm flying to
Sydney in the morning.

63
00:14:28,817 --> 00:14:29,981
Uh-huh.

64
00:14:29,982 --> 00:14:32,516
- Come far?
- Tiboonda.

65
00:14:32,517 --> 00:14:33,618
Ah, nice little place.

66
00:14:34,617 --> 00:14:35,816
Do you like it?

67
00:14:35,817 --> 00:14:36,884
Paradise on earth.

68
00:14:37,883 --> 00:14:39,549
Yeah.

69
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,583
What do you do out there?

70
00:14:41,584 --> 00:14:44,251
Oh, I'm a bonded slave of
the education department.

71
00:14:46,249 --> 00:14:47,617
I'm a school teacher.

72
00:14:47,618 --> 00:14:49,615
Oh, yes.

73
00:14:49,616 --> 00:14:51,647
You took over from old
Murchison, didn't you?

74
00:14:51,648 --> 00:14:52,880
McDonald, his name is.

75
00:14:52,881 --> 00:14:54,352
Of course.
And you're, uh...

76
00:14:57,349 --> 00:14:58,881
Grant.

77
00:14:58,882 --> 00:15:00,748
Yeah, that's right.

78
00:15:00,749 --> 00:15:02,717
Well, I'll be blown.
Crawford's the name.

79
00:15:03,716 --> 00:15:05,614
Jock Crawford.

80
00:15:05,615 --> 00:15:06,814
John Grant.

81
00:15:06,815 --> 00:15:09,755
I'm pleased to know you, Jack.
What about another beer?

82
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:17,904
Thanks, Mr. Crawford.

83
00:15:38,883 --> 00:15:40,681
- Here you are, Jack.
- Thanks.

84
00:15:40,682 --> 00:15:41,581
You, uh...

85
00:15:43,282 --> 00:15:45,280
You say you're a slave.

86
00:15:45,281 --> 00:15:47,514
What do you mean by that?

87
00:15:47,515 --> 00:15:49,514
You wouldn't know how our
educational authorities

88
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:50,674
get teachers for the outback?

89
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,614
Wouldn't have a clue, mate.

90
00:15:53,615 --> 00:15:57,815
Now, a new teacher has
to post a bond for $1,000.

91
00:15:57,816 --> 00:15:59,583
That 1,000 guarantees you'll
serve out your contract

92
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:02,748
wherever they send you.

93
00:16:02,749 --> 00:16:06,881
Oh, well. I suppose they
know what they're doing.

94
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,982
You clever blokes never like to
stop in the one spot long, do you?

95
00:16:10,981 --> 00:16:12,979
Depends on the place.

96
00:16:13,549 --> 00:16:15,280
Yeah, that's right.

97
00:16:15,281 --> 00:16:17,614
Well, never mind, Jack.

98
00:16:17,615 --> 00:16:19,613
You can always come to the
yabba for your holidays.

99
00:16:19,616 --> 00:16:21,681
Good luck.

100
00:16:21,682 --> 00:16:23,295
Yes, that's something
to look forward to.

101
00:16:36,282 --> 00:16:37,601
No, thanks,
I'll be running along.

102
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:58,314
Police have much to
do in Bundanyabba?

103
00:16:58,315 --> 00:17:00,914
No. No, not really.

104
00:17:00,915 --> 00:17:02,980
We sort of...

105
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:05,948
We just sort of
keep an eye on things.

106
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:07,907
Honestest little town in
Australia, this is, mate.

107
00:17:09,314 --> 00:17:11,680
But, mind you,
there are not too many

108
00:17:11,681 --> 00:17:14,345
game enough to try
anything around here.

109
00:17:14,346 --> 00:17:17,216
You see, we're so isolated,
there's nowhere to go.

110
00:17:18,215 --> 00:17:20,747
We get 'em, and quick.

111
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:21,749
Sounds like an easy life.

112
00:17:22,748 --> 00:17:23,816
Yeah, not bad.

113
00:17:25,814 --> 00:17:27,515
Of course,
we do have a few suicides.

114
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:29,880
Yeah?

115
00:17:29,881 --> 00:17:31,359
Yeah. Yeah,
they reckon it's the heat.

116
00:17:33,214 --> 00:17:35,849
Me...
I like the heat.

117
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,782
Yeah, it's one way of
getting out of town.

118
00:17:39,781 --> 00:17:40,815
What is?

119
00:17:41,814 --> 00:17:42,714
Killing yourself.

120
00:17:47,548 --> 00:17:50,881
Hey, that's good. I like a
bloke with a sense of humor.

121
00:17:52,248 --> 00:17:53,893
Oh... killing yourself.

122
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,779
Two more, Kate.

123
00:18:15,581 --> 00:18:17,212
Have you ever
been anywhere else?

124
00:18:17,213 --> 00:18:18,971
Yeah. Did three months'
training in the city.

125
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,751
Didn't like it.

126
00:18:29,747 --> 00:18:31,679
A couple more?

127
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,882
Here, give us your dough.
I'll get 'em quicker than you.

128
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,947
<i>* Then one foggy Christmas Eve</i>

129
00:18:38,948 --> 00:18:42,646
<i>* Santa came to say</i>

130
00:18:42,647 --> 00:18:46,346
<i>* Rudolph,
with your nose so bright</i>

131
00:18:46,347 --> 00:18:49,313
<i>* won't you guide
my sleigh tonight?</i>

132
00:18:49,314 --> 00:18:50,980
<i>* Then all the reindeer
loved him *</i>

133
00:18:58,213 --> 00:19:01,780
Here you are. I slung your
change to the steward.

134
00:19:01,781 --> 00:19:03,713
Told him it was yours.

135
00:19:03,714 --> 00:19:05,513
Do you a bit of good
when you come back again.

136
00:19:12,846 --> 00:19:13,916
Get up, get up.

137
00:19:17,912 --> 00:19:20,278
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

138
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:22,549
<i>let us pay a tribute
to our fallen comrades.</i>

139
00:19:24,547 --> 00:19:28,879
<i>They shall grow not old,
as we that are left grow old.</i>

140
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,945
<i>Age shall not weary them,
nor the years condemn.</i>

141
00:19:32,946 --> 00:19:35,744
<i>At the going down of the sun,
and in the morning,</i>

142
00:19:35,745 --> 00:19:36,665
<i>we will remember them.</i>

143
00:19:38,213 --> 00:19:39,522
We will remember them.

144
00:19:48,513 --> 00:19:49,779
<i>Lest we forget.</i>

145
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,779
Lest we forget.

146
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,100
<i>Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

147
00:20:04,947 --> 00:20:07,781
No, as long as they close before
the show, they're shut...

148
00:20:10,245 --> 00:20:12,544
Come on, the beer's
real good here.

149
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:15,910
Oh, no, jock. No, I'll pass
out if I don't eat soon.

150
00:20:15,911 --> 00:20:17,979
Well, it's easy to see
you're not a yabba man.

151
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,244
A yabba man!

152
00:20:20,245 --> 00:20:22,748
A yabba man...
You're the yabba man, jock.

153
00:20:24,746 --> 00:20:26,545
The Bundanyabba man.

154
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:31,612
All right, all right.

155
00:20:31,613 --> 00:20:33,930
Come on, I'll show you where
you can get a real good steak.

156
00:20:35,746 --> 00:20:38,610
This is a mate of mine, John Grant.
You can let him in anytime.

157
00:20:38,611 --> 00:20:39,510
He's all right.

158
00:20:41,245 --> 00:20:42,678
How's it going there, jock?

159
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:44,246
Oh, not too bad, Jim.
How's it with you?

160
00:20:44,247 --> 00:20:45,852
Great.

161
00:20:53,844 --> 00:20:56,810
Hey, Joe. Put a steak on
for me mate, will you?

162
00:20:56,811 --> 00:20:58,750
Yeah, lovely. Hey, Tim.
One steak, mate.

163
00:21:03,745 --> 00:21:04,745
Oh, rare, please.

164
00:21:04,746 --> 00:21:05,878
Yeah, all right.

165
00:21:05,879 --> 00:21:07,644
How's the missus?

166
00:21:07,645 --> 00:21:09,610
Oh, she was a bit crook last week.
She all right now, jock.

167
00:21:09,611 --> 00:21:11,050
- And the kid?
- Oh, this kid's gold.

168
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:13,313
You tell him to stop missing
school or I'll have you.

169
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:14,679
All right, mate.

170
00:21:15,678 --> 00:21:16,580
Come on, I'll show you
inside while we're waiting.

171
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:18,478
All right.

172
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:21,212
Biggest two-up game
in Australia, Jack.

173
00:21:27,979 --> 00:21:30,677
Right on, fellas.
I want 100 in the middle.

174
00:21:30,678 --> 00:21:32,211
The spinner's
the bloke with the kip.

175
00:21:32,212 --> 00:21:33,777
Kip?

176
00:21:33,778 --> 00:21:35,276
Yeah, the bit of wood
they put the pennies on.

177
00:21:35,277 --> 00:21:37,843
He's just dropped
$100 in the center.

178
00:21:37,844 --> 00:21:40,209
That's got to be covered
before they can spin 'em.

179
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,489
Now it's been covered, they can
all get in for a side bet.

180
00:21:51,245 --> 00:21:52,744
Heads, heads, heads...

181
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:54,315
Tails. Tails.

182
00:21:58,311 --> 00:22:01,209
- Who wants to go on the heads?
- Put 50 on heads.

183
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,975
You know, the little fella with the
kip's a fella named Charlie Jones.

184
00:22:03,976 --> 00:22:06,054
Comes in here every Friday
night with his pay packet.

185
00:22:09,211 --> 00:22:10,110
Bets are closing.

186
00:22:10,977 --> 00:22:12,246
Clear a space.

187
00:22:14,244 --> 00:22:16,244
Quiet! Hey!

188
00:22:18,744 --> 00:22:20,702
Settle down, settle down.
What do you think it is?

189
00:22:21,512 --> 00:22:22,618
Fair go, chaps.

190
00:22:29,611 --> 00:22:30,744
Heads!

191
00:22:37,577 --> 00:22:39,877
Do you get the idea now, Jack?

192
00:22:39,878 --> 00:22:42,277
Well, you just bet on whether the
pennies come down heads or tails.

193
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,610
Yeah, that's right.

194
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:46,708
You think this
crowd will be at each

195
00:22:46,709 --> 00:22:47,744
other's throats
when they settle?

196
00:22:47,745 --> 00:22:50,310
Ah, there's hardly a fight.

197
00:22:50,311 --> 00:22:53,210
Each man knows what's coming to
him, he just goes and gets it.

198
00:22:53,211 --> 00:22:54,213
Heads, heads, heads...

199
00:22:55,211 --> 00:22:57,209
Tails, tails, tails...

200
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,110
Sixty on tails...

201
00:23:03,243 --> 00:23:04,142
Fair go.

202
00:23:10,878 --> 00:23:11,777
Watch your feet now.

203
00:23:12,877 --> 00:23:14,576
Watch yourself there.

204
00:23:14,577 --> 00:23:16,642
Wait for it. Wait for it now.

205
00:23:16,643 --> 00:23:17,542
Heads!

206
00:23:29,744 --> 00:23:30,976
Four hundred, Charlie,
what do you wanna do?

207
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:32,609
Put the lot on.

208
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:35,278
Yeah, Charlie always
goes for 800 or bust.

209
00:23:37,276 --> 00:23:39,642
You gotta throw four heads
in a row to do it, too.

210
00:23:39,643 --> 00:23:40,840
Come on now, hurry up.
Get 'em on.

211
00:23:40,841 --> 00:23:42,545
And what does he do
with the winnings?

212
00:23:43,544 --> 00:23:44,581
Well, nothing.

213
00:23:47,578 --> 00:23:48,809
Simmer down, boys.

214
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,210
Settle down.

215
00:23:50,211 --> 00:23:51,708
Put 'em on,
Charlie, now, come on.

216
00:23:51,709 --> 00:23:52,874
When you're ready, Charles.

217
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:53,977
When you're ready.

218
00:23:53,978 --> 00:23:54,877
Fair go.

219
00:23:55,743 --> 00:23:56,647
Fair go.

220
00:24:00,643 --> 00:24:01,583
Heads.

221
00:24:07,577 --> 00:24:08,518
Beauty, Charlie.

222
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,870
You're casting
a spell around here.

223
00:24:19,243 --> 00:24:20,744
There's a nice
simple-minded game.

224
00:24:22,742 --> 00:24:23,977
My steak's probably ready.

225
00:24:23,978 --> 00:24:25,610
Yeah, come on.

226
00:24:26,609 --> 00:24:28,128
Here you are.
That'll be a dollar, son.

227
00:24:32,876 --> 00:24:34,810
There's a clean
place here, Jack.

228
00:24:34,811 --> 00:24:35,714
Oh.

229
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,807
Well, I'll have to
be pushing along.

230
00:24:41,808 --> 00:24:43,543
Oh, thanks, jock. Thanks
for showing me around.

231
00:24:43,544 --> 00:24:45,276
Oh, that's all right.

232
00:24:46,275 --> 00:24:47,941
And that'll be
the best dollar's worth

233
00:24:47,942 --> 00:24:49,381
you'll ever have
in your life, Matey.

234
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:55,302
All the little devils
are proud of hell.

235
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:58,875
Two heads.

236
00:25:05,908 --> 00:25:07,973
Do you mean you
don't think the yabba

237
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:09,453
is the greatest
little place on earth?

238
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,242
It could be worse.

239
00:25:12,775 --> 00:25:13,674
How?

240
00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:17,254
The supply of
beer could run out.

241
00:25:29,242 --> 00:25:31,209
Hey, aren't you
going to eat that?

242
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:32,109
No.

243
00:25:47,741 --> 00:25:48,875
Why did you say that?

244
00:25:48,876 --> 00:25:50,774
Say what?

245
00:25:50,775 --> 00:25:52,543
Well, about them
being proud of hell.

246
00:25:54,541 --> 00:25:56,141
Discontent is a luxury
of the well-to-do.

247
00:25:57,942 --> 00:25:59,912
If you gotta live here,
you might as well like it.

248
00:26:03,908 --> 00:26:05,342
Why don't you like Crawford?

249
00:26:05,343 --> 00:26:06,810
Jock?

250
00:26:08,808 --> 00:26:10,811
The touch of his
hairy hand offends you.

251
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:15,873
I'm just bored with it.
The aggressive hospitality,

252
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,739
the arrogance of stupid people

253
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,579
who insist you should be
as stupid as they are.

254
00:26:20,609 --> 00:26:21,729
It's death to farm out here.

255
00:26:24,576 --> 00:26:25,935
It's worse than
death in the mines.

256
00:26:28,508 --> 00:26:30,026
Do you want them to
sing opera as well?

257
00:26:34,841 --> 00:26:35,740
And what do you do?

258
00:26:38,707 --> 00:26:39,715
I drink.

259
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:47,910
This beer's gone warm.

260
00:26:50,907 --> 00:26:51,980
I...

261
00:26:56,975 --> 00:26:58,973
Heads.

262
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,439
Here you are, doc.

263
00:27:03,275 --> 00:27:04,174
Thanks, Joe.

264
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:07,673
It's a spinner's night,
nearly two-to-one on heads.

265
00:27:07,674 --> 00:27:08,741
Good on you, doc.

266
00:27:08,742 --> 00:27:11,760
Good on you... mate.

267
00:27:30,741 --> 00:27:31,940
You want to bet on tails, son?

268
00:27:36,875 --> 00:27:38,793
Fifty for the guy in the
jacket over there, slim.

269
00:27:44,874 --> 00:27:45,773
Fair go.

270
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:48,945
When you're ready there, Brian.

271
00:27:50,874 --> 00:27:53,610
No betting when I say fair go.
Fair go, Brian.

272
00:27:55,608 --> 00:27:56,975
Fair go.

273
00:27:58,973 --> 00:27:59,872
Two tails!

274
00:28:11,507 --> 00:28:13,272
Anybody seen
a bloke with a coat on?

275
00:28:13,273 --> 00:28:14,874
Where's that bloke in a coat?

276
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:16,609
Here! Here.

277
00:28:19,606 --> 00:28:21,209
Thought I lost you, mate.

278
00:28:23,207 --> 00:28:24,106
Move over!

279
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,206
Sit down here, son.

280
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:28,972
How many heads up?

281
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:30,606
Heads, heads! I bet on heads.

282
00:28:30,607 --> 00:28:32,638
Anyone betting on tails?

283
00:28:32,639 --> 00:28:33,638
No, on heads.

284
00:28:33,639 --> 00:28:34,739
Tails, 100!

285
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,972
You're covered!

286
00:28:35,973 --> 00:28:37,607
- A hundred for you?
- Yes.

287
00:28:38,606 --> 00:28:39,505
You're on a head.

288
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,676
Anymore tails?

289
00:28:43,674 --> 00:28:45,432
Will you place your bets
and take your seats?

290
00:28:51,506 --> 00:28:52,405
Sorry, son.

291
00:28:52,873 --> 00:28:54,273
Be quiet!

292
00:28:57,574 --> 00:28:58,573
When you're ready for it.

293
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,839
Fair go.

294
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:02,405
They're up!

295
00:29:04,807 --> 00:29:06,310
- Play for now.
- Hold it!

296
00:29:10,306 --> 00:29:12,249
- Heads!
- All right.

297
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,437
When you're ready.

298
00:29:22,438 --> 00:29:26,307
Don't forget, every Wednesday,
Thursday and Friday night!

299
00:29:27,306 --> 00:29:28,545
Early start
Christmas Eve, boys!

300
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,978
Bring your own money,
anybody's girl.

301
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:35,171
Leaving it all on heads, mate?

302
00:29:37,706 --> 00:29:38,606
Two hundred on tails.

303
00:29:38,872 --> 00:29:40,205
I'll have 100.

304
00:29:40,206 --> 00:29:41,208
You're on.

305
00:29:43,206 --> 00:29:44,706
- What are you backing, mate?
- Tails.

306
00:29:44,707 --> 00:29:45,907
You're set.

307
00:29:46,906 --> 00:29:48,645
I'll back a head.
I'll back... you're up?

308
00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:55,606
Thanks, mate.

309
00:29:56,605 --> 00:29:58,705
You're too noisy!

310
00:29:58,706 --> 00:30:00,212
Fair go, spinner.
When you're ready.

311
00:30:05,207 --> 00:30:06,910
One of each,
which is no result.

312
00:30:11,905 --> 00:30:12,906
Fair go.

313
00:30:13,905 --> 00:30:15,246
Fair go!

314
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:23,138
Tails, they are!

315
00:30:38,806 --> 00:30:39,908
Whoo!

316
00:31:55,871 --> 00:31:56,770
$1,000.

317
00:31:58,305 --> 00:31:59,204
Just...

318
00:32:00,604 --> 00:32:01,640
Just one more spin,

319
00:32:03,638 --> 00:32:04,541
and you're out of it.

320
00:32:07,538 --> 00:32:08,437
Out of teaching.

321
00:32:12,205 --> 00:32:13,104
Out of Tiboonda.

322
00:32:20,837 --> 00:32:22,272
Toss? Toss?

323
00:32:23,271 --> 00:32:25,537
Toss? Toss?

324
00:32:25,538 --> 00:32:26,769
Who wants to toss?

325
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,304
Yes!

326
00:32:28,305 --> 00:32:29,581
Here you are, son.

327
00:32:38,571 --> 00:32:39,570
How much you tossing for?

328
00:32:44,204 --> 00:32:45,937
$400 on tails.

329
00:32:45,938 --> 00:32:47,735
You can't spin for tails, mate.

330
00:32:47,736 --> 00:32:49,096
The spinner always
spins for heads.

331
00:32:50,271 --> 00:32:51,272
- Heads.
- On a head.

332
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:53,637
Four hundred, Charlie.

333
00:33:07,836 --> 00:33:09,995
Watch out, imbecile! Watch
where you're going, you mug.

334
00:33:15,804 --> 00:33:16,703
When you're right now.

335
00:33:20,537 --> 00:33:22,568
Come on,
out of the ring, you blokes.

336
00:33:22,569 --> 00:33:23,468
Fair go, son.

337
00:33:26,336 --> 00:33:27,675
Heads.

338
00:33:31,671 --> 00:33:32,673
Settle down!

339
00:33:34,671 --> 00:33:36,301
No, son. You gotta put 'em
above your head and spin it.

340
00:33:36,302 --> 00:33:37,340
- All right?
- I'm sorry.

341
00:33:40,337 --> 00:33:41,871
When you're right now.

342
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:43,770
Wait for it now.

343
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,503
When you're right.

344
00:33:47,504 --> 00:33:48,714
Fair go.

345
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,345
Tails, two tails.

346
00:34:42,302 --> 00:34:43,869
What, still here, Jack?

347
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,602
Hmm? Mmm.

348
00:34:45,603 --> 00:34:46,902
How goes it?

349
00:34:46,903 --> 00:34:47,905
Well, jock.

350
00:34:49,903 --> 00:34:52,603
Look, um, will they cash a
check for me in this place?

351
00:34:52,604 --> 00:34:54,901
Yeah, for how much?

352
00:34:54,902 --> 00:34:56,204
Two hundred and ninety dollars.

353
00:34:57,203 --> 00:34:58,802
- Gonna try the game, eh?
- Yes.

354
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,203
Two-ninety on heads.

355
00:35:12,802 --> 00:35:13,873
Well, he's on heads now.

356
00:35:19,303 --> 00:35:20,334
What are you betting on, mate?

357
00:35:20,335 --> 00:35:21,670
Two-ninety on heads.

358
00:35:21,671 --> 00:35:22,653
You're on.

359
00:37:00,268 --> 00:37:03,936
Can you... can you tell me
where the labor exchange is?

360
00:37:04,935 --> 00:37:08,200
Turn left as you go out,
second street, turn right,

361
00:37:08,201 --> 00:37:09,839
next street,
turn left, it's on the right.

362
00:39:11,733 --> 00:39:13,200
Yeah, so I say to this mug, I
said, "you better get out.

363
00:39:13,201 --> 00:39:15,632
"You're barred from the pub.

364
00:39:15,633 --> 00:39:16,597
"Every time you come in
here, you put on trouble."

365
00:39:16,598 --> 00:39:18,597
And then, all of a sudden,
he turned it on.

366
00:39:18,598 --> 00:39:19,766
I grabbed him by the scruff
of the neck and I hit him.

367
00:39:19,767 --> 00:39:21,698
Done the knuckle in.

368
00:39:21,699 --> 00:39:23,733
Knuckle's squished up
back here.

369
00:39:23,734 --> 00:39:25,603
Yeah, it's been six weeks.

370
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,930
All these mugs I get in here.
They want to try you out.

371
00:39:30,931 --> 00:39:32,775
They all come from far
and wide to try you out.

372
00:39:41,765 --> 00:39:42,665
Hot?

373
00:39:44,932 --> 00:39:45,831
Hot.

374
00:39:48,899 --> 00:39:49,898
New to the yabba?

375
00:39:51,499 --> 00:39:52,570
New to the yabba.

376
00:39:56,565 --> 00:39:57,600
Like the old place?

377
00:39:59,598 --> 00:40:00,797
No, I think it's bloody awful.

378
00:40:01,765 --> 00:40:03,201
You don't like the yabba?

379
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,213
No.

380
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,831
Will you have a drink?

381
00:40:19,832 --> 00:40:22,296
No, I'm toying
with this one, thanks.

382
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:24,564
Well, drink it down,
I'll buy you another.

383
00:40:24,565 --> 00:40:26,330
Look, I'm flat broke and
I can't afford to drink!

384
00:40:26,331 --> 00:40:27,896
What's that go to
do with it, man?

385
00:40:27,897 --> 00:40:30,596
I said I'd buy you a drink!
You don't have to buy me one!

386
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:31,496
Now, drink it down!

387
00:40:43,799 --> 00:40:45,900
Two middies, Keith.
Don't forget the tomato juice.

388
00:40:46,899 --> 00:40:48,267
I'm Tim Hynes.

389
00:40:51,264 --> 00:40:52,163
John Grant.

390
00:40:55,865 --> 00:40:58,199
Hey. Good shot.

391
00:40:59,198 --> 00:41:00,498
Are you a Mason?

392
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,266
What? No!

393
00:41:03,265 --> 00:41:04,599
You're in the buffs.

394
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,597
In the what?

395
00:41:05,598 --> 00:41:06,497
In the buffs.

396
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:08,600
The buffs?

397
00:41:10,598 --> 00:41:13,264
Are you a member of
the buffalo lodge?

398
00:41:13,265 --> 00:41:14,733
No.
Never heard of it.

399
00:41:16,731 --> 00:41:17,831
Not a Mason, not a buff.

400
00:41:17,832 --> 00:41:19,597
No.

401
00:41:19,598 --> 00:41:21,764
Ah, you'll be
a Roman catholic, then.

402
00:41:21,765 --> 00:41:23,500
Oh, no, I'm not.

403
00:41:25,498 --> 00:41:26,904
Well, what are you going to do?

404
00:41:32,898 --> 00:41:34,529
You're not a buff?

405
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:35,831
I am not a buff.

406
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,597
Poor old John.

407
00:41:38,598 --> 00:41:40,263
Poor old John.

408
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:42,200
Well, we better
have another beer.

409
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:44,098
Hey!

410
00:41:44,864 --> 00:41:46,764
I was just checking your oil.

411
00:41:50,865 --> 00:41:52,231
Now, come on, John.

412
00:41:52,232 --> 00:41:53,430
Hey, Keith, a couple of beers!

413
00:41:57,764 --> 00:41:59,730
Well, here we are, John.

414
00:41:59,731 --> 00:42:00,851
- Home, sweet home.
- Uh-huh!

415
00:42:17,264 --> 00:42:19,666
Grab yourself a seat, John,
I'll tell Janette we're here.

416
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:24,863
Janette! Put these in
the fridge, will you?

417
00:42:24,864 --> 00:42:27,622
Oh, I brought a friend back, so set
another place for lunch, will you?

418
00:43:06,529 --> 00:43:07,428
Oh!

419
00:43:10,931 --> 00:43:11,830
How do you do?

420
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:14,731
Fine.

421
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:16,736
How are you?

422
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:25,762
I really must apologize for
landing on you like this.

423
00:43:25,763 --> 00:43:27,597
Mr. Hynes more
or less insisted.

424
00:43:28,596 --> 00:43:29,495
He usually does.

425
00:43:56,196 --> 00:43:57,645
Oh, my name's John Grant.

426
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:13,916
I'm Janette Hynes.

427
00:44:33,896 --> 00:44:35,230
Oh.

428
00:44:36,229 --> 00:44:37,128
Thanks.

429
00:44:56,862 --> 00:44:59,596
Over the teeth and round the gums,
look out belly, here it comes!

430
00:45:01,828 --> 00:45:03,661
Just a little
quickie before lunch.

431
00:45:03,662 --> 00:45:04,896
Lunch is ready now, daddy.

432
00:45:04,897 --> 00:45:07,194
I know.

433
00:45:07,195 --> 00:45:09,628
But firstly, John and I
must have an aperitif.

434
00:45:12,862 --> 00:45:14,329
Ah.

435
00:45:15,328 --> 00:45:16,227
John, old man,

436
00:45:17,562 --> 00:45:18,530
about your troubles,

437
00:45:20,528 --> 00:45:22,929
a terrible thing,
you losing all that money.

438
00:45:23,928 --> 00:45:25,860
You have no idea...

439
00:45:25,861 --> 00:45:27,861
No, it was somewhere between
the train and the hotel.

440
00:45:27,862 --> 00:45:29,262
Hmm.

441
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:32,860
I could put a call
through to Sydney.

442
00:45:32,861 --> 00:45:34,834
No, there's no one
there I could borrow from.

443
00:45:40,828 --> 00:45:43,595
John, I'd love to
lend you some...

444
00:45:43,596 --> 00:45:45,874
No, no. No, no, no. I wouldn't,
really, I'll be all right.

445
00:45:46,562 --> 00:45:48,297
Ah, you're a good bloke.

446
00:45:50,295 --> 00:45:51,563
We'll think of something.

447
00:45:52,562 --> 00:45:54,561
Now, don't you worry, lad.

448
00:45:54,562 --> 00:45:55,729
- Right.
- And drink up.

449
00:45:56,728 --> 00:45:57,798
Drink up.

450
00:46:12,694 --> 00:46:13,862
I say!

451
00:46:15,494 --> 00:46:16,761
Wake up, Tim!

452
00:46:18,694 --> 00:46:21,194
Well, that's... That's Dick and
Joe, couple of old mates of mine.

453
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,561
I want you to meet them.

454
00:46:23,562 --> 00:46:24,682
Come on in, boys.
Come on in.

455
00:46:25,761 --> 00:46:27,593
Am I glad to see you!

456
00:46:27,594 --> 00:46:29,195
You look bloody awful, mate.

457
00:46:29,196 --> 00:46:30,726
I feel bloody awful!

458
00:46:30,727 --> 00:46:31,726
Hey!

459
00:46:32,562 --> 00:46:34,726
Too much of the old booze.

460
00:46:34,727 --> 00:46:36,560
Oh, cut it out, boys, will you?
Stop it!

461
00:46:36,561 --> 00:46:37,792
Hey. Let's all
have a drink.

462
00:46:37,793 --> 00:46:39,327
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
- What, what?

463
00:46:39,328 --> 00:46:40,761
Who's your mate?

464
00:46:40,762 --> 00:46:41,961
Who? Oh, he...
Oh, that's John.

465
00:46:41,962 --> 00:46:43,860
This is, uh, Dick and Joe.

466
00:46:43,861 --> 00:46:45,594
You're an ignorant bludger.

467
00:46:45,595 --> 00:46:47,263
- G'day.
- How are you?

468
00:46:49,261 --> 00:46:50,662
- G'day, John.
- How are you?

469
00:46:56,728 --> 00:46:58,596
Uh, you're new to the
yabba, are you, John?

470
00:46:59,595 --> 00:47:01,193
Yes. Yes.

471
00:47:01,194 --> 00:47:02,093
Hmm.

472
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:11,193
G'day, Janette.

473
00:47:11,826 --> 00:47:12,725
Pretty as ever, eh?

474
00:47:27,228 --> 00:47:29,492
Missed me.

475
00:47:29,493 --> 00:47:31,732
Tim, I'll be moving off now.
Thanks for your hospitality.

476
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:34,625
Moving off?

477
00:47:36,327 --> 00:47:37,592
Where would you be going, lad?

478
00:47:37,593 --> 00:47:38,492
Well, I've...

479
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,794
Well, I've gotta look for work.

480
00:47:40,795 --> 00:47:42,626
On a Saturday?

481
00:47:42,627 --> 00:47:44,328
Look, why don't
you just hang around?

482
00:47:45,327 --> 00:47:46,226
We'll fix you up.

483
00:47:51,627 --> 00:47:53,859
Look, just drink your beer,

484
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:55,299
sit down, stop worrying, huh?

485
00:48:01,293 --> 00:48:03,624
John's got a bit of trouble,
but nothing to worry about.

486
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:04,927
She'll be right, mate.

487
00:48:04,928 --> 00:48:06,526
Drink up.

488
00:48:06,527 --> 00:48:07,866
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

489
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:14,759
Hey.

490
00:48:27,892 --> 00:48:29,325
- Hey, Tim.
- Yeah?

491
00:48:29,326 --> 00:48:30,960
I got news for you, mate.

492
00:48:31,959 --> 00:48:32,858
What do you think?

493
00:48:33,725 --> 00:48:34,860
What do you think?

494
00:48:34,861 --> 00:48:35,926
You got piles.

495
00:48:37,527 --> 00:48:38,725
No, no, no, no.

496
00:48:38,726 --> 00:48:40,560
You know
Stanley's brindle bitch?

497
00:48:40,561 --> 00:48:42,659
- Yeah.
- Sold her to me.

498
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:44,259
- English bred.
- You're a liar.

499
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:45,625
It's the truth.

500
00:48:45,626 --> 00:48:47,325
She's got a broken leg.

501
00:48:47,326 --> 00:48:49,593
I'm not ribbing you,
mate, he sold her to me.

502
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:51,891
A great dog. A great dog!

503
00:48:51,892 --> 00:48:52,860
A great dog.

504
00:48:53,859 --> 00:48:55,326
Good dog.

505
00:48:55,327 --> 00:48:57,858
Come off it, mate.

506
00:48:57,859 --> 00:49:00,725
This'll be one of the best bloody
dogs I've ever seen after roos.

507
00:49:00,726 --> 00:49:01,728
Eh?

508
00:49:03,726 --> 00:49:04,859
You've gotta be kidding!

509
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,092
What makes a good dog?

510
00:49:10,326 --> 00:49:11,865
Can I help you?

511
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:18,557
So, we let this ferret go
down the rabbit's burrow...

512
00:49:18,558 --> 00:49:19,837
I studied
history and literature.

513
00:49:22,493 --> 00:49:23,557
And what can you do with that

514
00:49:23,558 --> 00:49:25,595
if your parents are nobody
and you have no money?

515
00:49:27,593 --> 00:49:28,792
Oh, I know I can teach, but...

516
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:34,292
I'd really like
to get to England.

517
00:49:34,293 --> 00:49:36,561
Well, this is bad enough,
but even Sydney, it's...

518
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:41,045
I'd really like
to get to England.

519
00:49:42,958 --> 00:49:44,794
What would you do there?

520
00:49:45,793 --> 00:49:46,795
Journalism.

521
00:49:48,793 --> 00:49:49,889
Do you have a girl?

522
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:50,789
Yes, in Sydney.

523
00:49:52,592 --> 00:49:53,491
What's her name?

524
00:49:54,193 --> 00:49:55,092
Robyn.

525
00:49:57,192 --> 00:49:58,195
Robyn.

526
00:50:00,193 --> 00:50:01,092
What's she like?

527
00:50:24,326 --> 00:50:25,965
Robyn.

528
00:50:32,958 --> 00:50:34,893
Would you take her
to England with you?

529
00:50:35,892 --> 00:50:36,791
Yes.

530
00:50:39,225 --> 00:50:40,125
Yes.

531
00:50:47,192 --> 00:50:48,858
Ooh!

532
00:50:48,859 --> 00:50:50,491
- Bells of Saint Mary's.
- Hey, hey, hey.

533
00:50:50,492 --> 00:50:52,791
Yeah?

534
00:50:52,792 --> 00:50:55,191
What's the matter with him? He'd
rather talk to a woman than drink?

535
00:50:55,192 --> 00:50:56,658
School teacher.

536
00:50:56,659 --> 00:50:57,558
Oh.

537
00:51:01,192 --> 00:51:03,657
Then we agreed, before the game
started, there was a $5 limit.

538
00:51:03,658 --> 00:51:05,558
No, there was
no agreement, mate.

539
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:07,491
Wait, wait, was that...

540
00:51:07,492 --> 00:51:08,960
What's the matter with you?

541
00:51:10,958 --> 00:51:12,792
There was no agreement made.

542
00:51:12,793 --> 00:51:14,889
Go on, you blokes, just...

543
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:16,257
Was there any
bloody agreement made?

544
00:51:16,258 --> 00:51:17,790
- I don't know.
- No.

545
00:51:17,791 --> 00:51:19,658
I hate to remind
you this is my house...

546
00:51:23,823 --> 00:51:25,222
You're always
bloody interrupting...

547
00:51:25,324 --> 00:51:26,724
It's got nothing to do

548
00:51:27,723 --> 00:51:29,191
with whose bloody house it is.

549
00:51:29,192 --> 00:51:31,590
Doc Tydon, you old bastard.

550
00:51:31,591 --> 00:51:33,191
- How do you know that?
- Great to see you.

551
00:51:33,192 --> 00:51:34,789
Hi, boys.

552
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:37,622
Have yourself a beer,
I got five aces coming up.

553
00:51:37,623 --> 00:51:39,856
If you're playing cards with
this lot, you'll need a doctor

554
00:51:39,857 --> 00:51:40,857
before the night is out.

555
00:51:51,723 --> 00:51:52,962
Why do you stay in Bundanyabba?

556
00:51:55,657 --> 00:51:57,559
No, I'm surprised,
I mean, you're

557
00:51:58,558 --> 00:52:00,490
pretty and...

558
00:52:00,491 --> 00:52:02,603
And there's a shortage of
pretty girls in this town.

559
00:52:14,591 --> 00:52:15,790
Ah, it's beautiful.
Smell that.

560
00:52:17,323 --> 00:52:18,257
Peppercorn.

561
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:26,898
Is it because of your father?

562
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:35,863
Sorry.

563
00:52:41,856 --> 00:52:44,522
The moonlight like snow

564
00:52:44,523 --> 00:52:47,205
upon the desert's dusty face.

565
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:04,222
All right, Dicky boy,
let's hear from you.

566
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:05,854
- What've you got?
- Three Jacks, mate.

567
00:53:05,855 --> 00:53:07,588
Ah-ha! Well, just hold it,
hold it, hold it.

568
00:53:07,589 --> 00:53:08,489
- Daddy?
- Flush.

569
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:10,721
Daddy?

570
00:53:10,722 --> 00:53:12,755
John and I are
going for a walk.

571
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:14,820
Well come on, come on, come on,
get me while I'm hot, boys.

572
00:53:14,821 --> 00:53:16,060
An inside showing all the time.

573
00:56:19,787 --> 00:56:22,253
It's not the gravity.

574
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:24,718
It's not the gravity
that makes the beer go down.

575
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:26,555
- It's peristalsis.
- Perry who?

576
00:56:26,556 --> 00:56:27,721
Perry Mason.

577
00:56:29,721 --> 00:56:31,586
Peristalsis,
it's the contraction

578
00:56:31,587 --> 00:56:32,826
of the muscles
of the esophagus.

579
00:56:34,788 --> 00:56:36,554
Come on, doc, get up, man!

580
00:56:36,555 --> 00:56:37,588
Come on.

581
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:42,320
Whoa, whoa!

582
00:56:51,621 --> 00:56:53,620
It'll be a week for sure.

583
00:56:53,621 --> 00:56:56,620
Hey, doc, doc?
Come in over here.

584
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:59,686
Look, doc, when is
she gonna whelp, huh?

585
00:56:59,687 --> 00:57:01,954
I tell you what, I'll give
you five it's a week, Joe.

586
00:57:01,955 --> 00:57:03,489
Listen to the doc.

587
00:57:04,488 --> 00:57:05,487
She's not pregnant.

588
00:57:08,555 --> 00:57:10,473
Cut it out, doc, come on.
When's she gonna whelp?

589
00:57:11,188 --> 00:57:12,321
Who's the father?

590
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,620
It's a dog, not a sheep.

591
00:57:20,188 --> 00:57:21,187
She'll have pups by morning.

592
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:22,587
Beauty.

593
00:57:22,588 --> 00:57:23,587
No way, I bet it'll be a week.

594
00:57:23,588 --> 00:57:25,519
I don't feel anything.

595
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,919
Come on, put your money out.
Five, right?

596
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,719
- Five.
- You're on for five.

597
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:31,658
Let's have a second opinion.

598
00:57:35,654 --> 00:57:36,553
Before morning.

599
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,586
- It'll be a week.
- You heard me say that.

600
00:57:39,587 --> 00:57:41,186
I didn't.

601
00:57:41,187 --> 00:57:42,853
Who is the father, anyway?

602
00:57:42,854 --> 00:57:44,852
I don't know.

603
00:57:44,853 --> 00:57:46,851
She's a slag, this little
mutt, she'd try anything.

604
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,650
You drank yourself
under the table

605
00:59:50,651 --> 00:59:52,255
after your little
episode with Janette.

606
00:59:55,252 --> 00:59:56,151
Get out.

607
00:59:57,719 --> 00:59:59,950
Don't get upset.

608
00:59:59,951 --> 01:00:01,852
We've all had our little
episodes with Janette.

609
01:00:07,685 --> 01:00:08,594
What a doll.

610
01:00:16,586 --> 01:00:17,485
Better.

611
01:00:17,952 --> 01:00:19,684
You need a drink.

612
01:00:19,685 --> 01:00:21,918
Oh, no. Water, please.

613
01:00:21,919 --> 01:00:24,549
Yabba water's only for washing.
Come on, drink it up.

614
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:25,450
It's a bit flat.

615
01:00:36,585 --> 01:00:37,484
Come and get it.

616
01:00:40,252 --> 01:00:42,319
Oh, no, thanks very much,
but I don't...

617
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,616
No, I'm sure you don't.

618
01:00:44,617 --> 01:00:46,685
But you'd better
eat it just the same.

619
01:00:46,686 --> 01:00:48,219
Come on, sit down.

620
01:00:49,218 --> 01:00:50,117
Sir John.

621
01:01:00,617 --> 01:01:02,186
Not too bad.

622
01:01:03,185 --> 01:01:04,233
Kangaroo.

623
01:01:19,218 --> 01:01:20,650
Want some sauce?

624
01:01:20,651 --> 01:01:21,786
What time did the, um...

625
01:01:22,785 --> 01:01:24,586
The, uh, party finish?

626
01:01:26,584 --> 01:01:27,818
About dawn.

627
01:01:28,816 --> 01:01:29,951
And what time is it now?

628
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:32,219
'Round about 4:00.

629
01:01:33,218 --> 01:01:34,221
4:00?

630
01:01:38,217 --> 01:01:39,949
Look...

631
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:43,316
Look, uh, thanks
for the hospitality.

632
01:01:43,317 --> 01:01:45,266
I'd better be going along now.

633
01:02:00,251 --> 01:02:01,150
You see, I'm the

634
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:03,630
school teacher at Tiboonda.

635
01:02:05,484 --> 01:02:06,384
And, um...

636
01:02:09,516 --> 01:02:12,186
Well, I lost all my money.

637
01:02:13,185 --> 01:02:14,186
Gambling.

638
01:02:16,184 --> 01:02:17,083
Yeah, I know.

639
01:02:19,883 --> 01:02:21,685
Why did you have to lie
about it to Tim Hynes?

640
01:02:23,683 --> 01:02:24,682
There's no disgrace here.

641
01:02:26,584 --> 01:02:27,483
Well...

642
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:32,817
Well, in any case,
I can't stay in your, um,

643
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:36,250
cabin, indefinitely, can I?

644
01:02:37,249 --> 01:02:38,552
It isn't mine.

645
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:42,715
I've just lived
here for five years.

646
01:02:42,716 --> 01:02:44,182
Anyway, you're
better off here than

647
01:02:44,183 --> 01:02:46,283
trying to sponge on
men like Tim Hynes.

648
01:02:46,284 --> 01:02:47,649
Sponge?

649
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:48,849
Yeah, sponge.

650
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:50,785
Sit down and eat your grub.

651
01:02:51,784 --> 01:02:52,918
You're gonna need it.

652
01:02:53,917 --> 01:02:55,851
We're going hunting
with Dick and Joe.

653
01:02:56,850 --> 01:02:57,817
Kangaroo.

654
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:00,717
- Hunting?
- Yeah, you were

655
01:03:03,816 --> 01:03:05,136
boasting in your cups,
and said...

656
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:07,818
Good shot.

657
01:03:10,815 --> 01:03:13,253
You said you won a silver medal
at school for target shooting.

658
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:15,649
Huh?

659
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:17,185
Remember?

660
01:03:19,183 --> 01:03:21,847
You wouldn't have
an aspirin, would you?

661
01:03:21,848 --> 01:03:23,047
No, I've got something better.

662
01:03:32,715 --> 01:03:34,781
This ought to
kill your headache

663
01:03:34,782 --> 01:03:36,181
and pep you up
a little bit as well.

664
01:03:37,916 --> 01:03:39,784
Wash it down with
some beer. Here.

665
01:03:41,782 --> 01:03:43,214
Oh, I'm allergic to...

666
01:03:43,215 --> 01:03:46,594
Ah, there's nothing in there to hurt you.
Go on, man, swallow it down.

667
01:03:58,582 --> 01:03:59,684
What a voice.

668
01:04:01,682 --> 01:04:02,921
She just opens her mouth and...

669
01:04:04,815 --> 01:04:06,184
And notes come floating out.

670
01:04:07,183 --> 01:04:08,717
Oh, sorry, I don't smoke.

671
01:04:10,715 --> 01:04:11,714
Would you like to try it?

672
01:04:13,482 --> 01:04:14,381
No.

673
01:04:19,849 --> 01:04:21,222
You've been here five years?

674
01:04:27,216 --> 01:04:29,218
Shall I satisfy your curiosity?

675
01:04:31,216 --> 01:04:32,815
I'm a doctor of medicine.

676
01:04:33,814 --> 01:04:35,548
And a tramp by temperament.

677
01:04:35,549 --> 01:04:36,448
I'm also an alcoholic.

678
01:04:38,315 --> 01:04:40,713
My disease prevented me
from practicing in Sydney,

679
01:04:40,714 --> 01:04:42,883
but out here it's
scarcely noticeable.

680
01:04:43,882 --> 01:04:45,920
Certainly doesn't stop people
from coming to see me.

681
01:04:47,749 --> 01:04:50,715
I charge no fees because I'm
not interested in money.

682
01:04:51,714 --> 01:04:54,647
Anyway, I'm unreliable.

683
01:04:54,648 --> 01:04:56,766
But I'm accepted socially
because I'm an educated man.

684
01:04:59,648 --> 01:05:00,550
Or character.

685
01:05:02,848 --> 01:05:04,549
I get my food from my friends.

686
01:05:05,548 --> 01:05:08,548
My requirements in beer.

687
01:05:08,549 --> 01:05:10,480
Which, with some
measure of self-control,

688
01:05:10,481 --> 01:05:11,841
is the only
alcohol I allow myself.

689
01:05:14,514 --> 01:05:16,193
And you get along
without money altogether.

690
01:05:18,649 --> 01:05:22,580
It's possible to live forever
in the yabba without money.

691
01:05:22,581 --> 01:05:24,780
As you probably noticed, some
of the natives are very...

692
01:05:26,549 --> 01:05:27,448
Hospitable.

693
01:05:42,182 --> 01:05:43,585
Take Janette for instance.

694
01:05:46,582 --> 01:05:48,421
Now there's a very
interesting biological case.

695
01:05:49,182 --> 01:05:51,716
If she were a man,
she'd be in jail for rape.

696
01:05:55,549 --> 01:05:56,848
If I were to marry, Janette's
just the sort of girl...

697
01:05:56,849 --> 01:05:57,850
Excuse me.

698
01:05:59,848 --> 01:06:01,850
Uh, can you tell
me where the, um...

699
01:06:03,848 --> 01:06:04,747
Toilet?

700
01:06:05,681 --> 01:06:06,581
Yes.

701
01:06:07,282 --> 01:06:08,190
Outside.

702
01:06:16,182 --> 01:06:17,948
I wouldn't recommend it.

703
01:06:18,947 --> 01:06:20,583
Do it out here in the open.

704
01:06:23,681 --> 01:06:24,580
No one around to see.

705
01:06:34,182 --> 01:06:35,881
If I were ever to marry,

706
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,638
Janette's the sort of
girl I'd like to marry.

707
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,649
She likes sex.

708
01:06:44,648 --> 01:06:47,684
She likes experiment
and she likes variety.

709
01:06:50,681 --> 01:06:52,946
We thought about
getting married once,

710
01:06:52,947 --> 01:06:55,264
but neither of us could live
with one person for very long.

711
01:06:57,613 --> 01:06:59,131
Still, she visits
me from time to time.

712
01:07:00,914 --> 01:07:01,813
When I want her.

713
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:06,520
And when she gets
bored with them.

714
01:07:13,513 --> 01:07:14,412
Beer?

715
01:07:21,181 --> 01:07:23,739
What's wrong with a woman taking
a man because she feels like it?

716
01:07:25,713 --> 01:07:27,180
I really don't know.

717
01:07:27,181 --> 01:07:28,747
Because there's
nothing wrong with it.

718
01:07:29,746 --> 01:07:31,711
Sex is just like eating.

719
01:07:31,712 --> 01:07:34,244
It's a thing you do
because you have to.

720
01:07:34,245 --> 01:07:37,713
Not 'cause you want to, but
most people are afraid of it.

721
01:07:37,714 --> 01:07:41,578
You seem offended by my
little discussion of Janette.

722
01:07:41,579 --> 01:07:43,713
In the circumstances, I
thought you'd be interested.

723
01:07:43,714 --> 01:07:45,545
Well, I'm not.

724
01:07:45,546 --> 01:07:46,825
You're probably
a little puritan,

725
01:07:48,281 --> 01:07:49,781
like the rest of these people.

726
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:51,900
They think Janette' s a slut.

727
01:07:55,214 --> 01:07:56,612
The women who'd
like to act like her

728
01:07:58,313 --> 01:07:59,950
and the men she has
given a tumble to.

729
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:05,582
Janette and I are alike.

730
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:08,514
We break the rules.

731
01:08:10,512 --> 01:08:12,513
But we know more about
ourselves than most people.

732
01:08:26,812 --> 01:08:27,711
Hey, doc! Doc!

733
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:31,678
Come on!

734
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:33,077
Make a bit of noise,
boys, will you?

735
01:08:33,246 --> 01:08:34,546
Hi, Dick.

736
01:08:36,312 --> 01:08:37,577
- Hey, Joe.
- In the back, fellas.

737
01:08:37,578 --> 01:08:38,515
Get back there.

738
01:08:46,646 --> 01:08:49,578
Hey, John.
I got a gun here for you.

739
01:08:49,579 --> 01:08:51,097
A bit old, probably
blow your head off.

740
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:01,811
Whoo-hoo!

741
01:09:01,812 --> 01:09:03,679
Look at her go there, boys!

742
01:09:25,678 --> 01:09:27,477
Watch out the dog doesn't
leak on you, Johnny.

743
01:09:35,578 --> 01:09:36,580
Roos!

744
01:09:37,579 --> 01:09:38,917
Go on. Get the bludgers.

745
01:09:52,546 --> 01:09:53,815
Look at him go!

746
01:09:57,811 --> 01:09:58,710
Get him!

747
01:10:01,311 --> 01:10:02,210
Go on! Go on!

748
01:10:08,178 --> 01:10:09,820
He's got him, he's got him!

749
01:10:35,811 --> 01:10:38,010
What are you doing? You want
to take my bloody head off?

750
01:10:41,178 --> 01:10:42,095
Look at him go!

751
01:10:43,945 --> 01:10:45,614
Get him! Get him!

752
01:10:53,578 --> 01:10:54,847
Look at him go, will you?

753
01:10:57,844 --> 01:10:58,757
Look at him go!

754
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:23,282
Hey, Socrates.
You got a shot in yet?

755
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:46,712
Get out.

756
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:48,610
Beauty. It's a boomer.

757
01:11:51,477 --> 01:11:53,575
Knocked him out.
It's no good skinning him, eh?

758
01:11:53,576 --> 01:11:55,247
- Where's the surgeon?
- Here.

759
01:11:58,244 --> 01:12:00,210
Doc eats 'em.

760
01:12:00,211 --> 01:12:01,770
Reckon they're
the best part of the roo.

761
01:12:02,709 --> 01:12:05,210
- Have you ever tried them?
- No.

762
01:12:05,211 --> 01:12:06,969
Better than oysters.
Put lead in your pencil.

763
01:12:15,576 --> 01:12:16,809
Any damage, sir?

764
01:12:16,810 --> 01:12:18,176
Ah, couple of dents.

765
01:12:18,177 --> 01:12:19,507
All right, now, let's go.

766
01:12:19,508 --> 01:12:20,547
No, no, let's get a drink.

767
01:12:21,277 --> 01:12:22,658
Johnny?

768
01:12:39,776 --> 01:12:41,844
Why don't you try
driving faster, mate?

769
01:12:42,843 --> 01:12:44,576
Hey, Stubbsy.

770
01:12:44,577 --> 01:12:45,476
Hi, fellas.

771
01:12:46,777 --> 01:12:48,643
Stick it up your arse.

772
01:12:48,644 --> 01:12:50,576
Heya, mate.

773
01:12:50,577 --> 01:12:51,842
You got any roos?

774
01:12:51,843 --> 01:12:52,963
No, mate. Couple of boomers.

775
01:12:53,743 --> 01:12:55,507
You blokes couldn't
hit elephants.

776
01:12:55,508 --> 01:12:56,841
- Eh?
- Couldn't hit elephants.

777
01:12:56,842 --> 01:12:57,708
We'll get 'em
tonight with the spot.

778
01:12:57,709 --> 01:12:59,209
What's a spot?

779
01:12:59,210 --> 01:13:01,609
Spotlight, it hypnotizes them.

780
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:03,276
- Hey, Stubbsy.
- Yeah?

781
01:13:03,277 --> 01:13:05,436
Stick these in your deep-freeze
till tonight, will you?

782
01:13:05,843 --> 01:13:06,962
Hope they're not yours, doc.

783
01:13:15,209 --> 01:13:16,108
Fox.

784
01:13:27,708 --> 01:13:29,242
Hey, I hit him!

785
01:13:29,243 --> 01:13:30,875
Hey, John, where you going?

786
01:13:30,876 --> 01:13:31,878
I hit him!

787
01:13:34,875 --> 01:13:37,233
It's no good skinning 'em, mate.
They're all mangy out here.

788
01:13:37,708 --> 01:13:38,828
Come on and drink your beer.

789
01:13:48,709 --> 01:13:49,708
Give us a
tailor-made, Joe

790
01:13:59,575 --> 01:14:01,176
- you need any more drinks?
- I guess it's my shout.

791
01:14:01,177 --> 01:14:02,708
Oh, no, no.

792
01:14:02,709 --> 01:14:04,608
This last round's on me.

793
01:14:04,609 --> 01:14:06,640
Nobody who's broke
buys beers in the yabba.

794
01:14:06,641 --> 01:14:08,607
I'm not broke,
I've got a dollar.

795
01:14:08,608 --> 01:14:10,308
Forget it, John, forget it.

796
01:14:10,309 --> 01:14:12,644
- $1.
- Look.

797
01:14:13,643 --> 01:14:15,942
When you got some money,
you can take us on a bash.

798
01:14:15,943 --> 01:14:18,474
- Right?
- Right.

799
01:14:18,475 --> 01:14:20,175
- Stubbsy?
- Yeah.

800
01:14:20,176 --> 01:14:21,943
Four more and
four double whiskeys.

801
01:14:21,944 --> 01:14:23,575
Right.

802
01:14:23,576 --> 01:14:24,742
And a packet of
smokes for the teacher.

803
01:14:24,743 --> 01:14:26,608
Three whiskeys, Dick.

804
01:14:26,609 --> 01:14:28,208
- Four.
- Three.

805
01:14:28,209 --> 01:14:29,709
- Four.
- Three.

806
01:14:30,708 --> 01:14:31,842
- Four.
- Three.

807
01:14:31,843 --> 01:14:32,943
Four.

808
01:16:14,607 --> 01:16:17,873
Hey, you got her fair, eh, doc?

809
01:16:17,874 --> 01:16:19,841
Hey, Joe, take a look
at this. It's a beauty.

810
01:16:19,842 --> 01:16:21,474
Yeah.

811
01:16:21,475 --> 01:16:23,476
He must be a
seven-footer for sure.

812
01:16:26,475 --> 01:16:29,212
Go on, Dick. We better cut
up a few for the dogs, eh?

813
01:17:06,174 --> 01:17:07,842
The big fellow just
won't go down, doc.

814
01:17:08,841 --> 01:17:10,572
Take us over there.

815
01:17:10,573 --> 01:17:11,939
He kicks you, you're dead.

816
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:12,840
Come on, take us over there.

817
01:17:12,841 --> 01:17:13,872
Righto, mate!

818
01:17:13,873 --> 01:17:14,772
Let's go.

819
01:17:31,574 --> 01:17:32,733
Get stuck into him, Joey boy.

820
01:17:33,474 --> 01:17:34,574
No worries!

821
01:17:46,506 --> 01:17:47,938
See the way the roo's
trying to draw him in

822
01:17:47,939 --> 01:17:49,937
so he can get back
up on his tail, see?

823
01:17:49,938 --> 01:17:52,376
Yeah, and then he rips his guts
out with his hind legs like...

824
01:18:15,873 --> 01:18:17,771
All right!

825
01:18:17,772 --> 01:18:20,240
Yippee, Joey boy!

826
01:18:21,239 --> 01:18:23,239
Come and get your beer, fella!

827
01:18:38,739 --> 01:18:41,170
Once you've got her by the
tail, it's as good as dead.

828
01:18:41,171 --> 01:18:42,273
Have you ever done it, Joe?

829
01:18:42,274 --> 01:18:43,638
- Dick?
- Eh?

830
01:18:43,639 --> 01:18:44,872
- Have you ever done it?
- What?

831
01:18:44,873 --> 01:18:47,171
Oh, yeah, hundreds of times.

832
01:18:47,172 --> 01:18:48,505
Yeah, of course he's done it.

833
01:18:48,506 --> 01:18:49,838
I've done it!

834
01:18:49,839 --> 01:18:51,576
Why? Do you want to
have a go, teacher?

835
01:18:54,573 --> 01:18:55,672
Why not?

836
01:18:57,572 --> 01:18:59,708
If I were you,
I wouldn't do it.

837
01:19:02,705 --> 01:19:04,024
Yeah, it's all right,
Joe, I will.

838
01:19:06,705 --> 01:19:08,274
You will?

839
01:19:33,672 --> 01:19:36,204
What's the matter,
teacher? You scared?

840
01:19:36,205 --> 01:19:38,472
It's only a baby.
It's badly wounded.

841
01:19:38,473 --> 01:19:39,840
Have a go, you mug.

842
01:19:50,304 --> 01:19:51,906
Go on, Johnny!

843
01:19:52,905 --> 01:19:54,937
Come on, Johnny!

844
01:19:54,938 --> 01:19:56,473
Go get him.

845
01:20:00,838 --> 01:20:02,616
He's trying to dance with him.

846
01:20:13,605 --> 01:20:15,470
Come on.

847
01:20:15,471 --> 01:20:16,671
Cut him through. Johnny!

848
01:20:16,672 --> 01:20:17,839
The throat!

849
01:20:29,604 --> 01:20:31,204
He's trying to beat
the thing to death.

850
01:20:33,572 --> 01:20:34,692
Through the throat, teacher.

851
01:20:41,571 --> 01:20:43,209
Come on, Johnny!

852
01:20:49,738 --> 01:20:50,737
You beauty!

853
01:20:53,637 --> 01:20:55,669
Well done.

854
01:20:55,670 --> 01:20:59,212
Yeah, that's it,
Johnny, now you're one of us.

855
01:22:00,837 --> 01:22:02,910
You bloody maniacs.

856
01:22:09,903 --> 01:22:11,002
Bloody maniacs.

857
01:22:17,170 --> 01:22:19,706
I cannot accept
your premise, Socrates.

858
01:22:22,703 --> 01:22:23,871
Affectability?

859
01:22:24,870 --> 01:22:25,971
Progress?

860
01:22:26,770 --> 01:22:28,871
A vanity spawned by fear.

861
01:22:32,237 --> 01:22:35,909
A vanity spawned by fear.

862
01:22:41,903 --> 01:22:44,702
The aim of what
you call civilization

863
01:22:44,703 --> 01:22:46,539
is a man in a smoking jacket,

864
01:22:48,537 --> 01:22:50,906
whiskey and cider,
pressing a bottom of...

865
01:22:52,904 --> 01:22:53,803
A button

866
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:58,704
to destroy a planet
a billion miles away,

867
01:23:00,702 --> 01:23:02,673
kill a billion
people he's never seen.

868
01:23:06,669 --> 01:23:07,768
Where are you?

869
01:23:08,469 --> 01:23:09,568
Come on!

870
01:23:09,870 --> 01:23:10,803
What happened?

871
01:23:11,802 --> 01:23:13,470
Hey, what happened to Socrates?

872
01:23:14,469 --> 01:23:16,501
Where's Socrates?

873
01:23:16,502 --> 01:23:17,673
- What?
- Socrates!

874
01:23:27,602 --> 01:23:29,672
You bastard.

875
01:23:34,670 --> 01:23:35,569
No, Joe!

876
01:23:37,169 --> 01:23:40,571
Stop it, you...
You murdering bastards.

877
01:23:41,570 --> 01:23:43,572
You bastards!

878
01:23:46,601 --> 01:23:47,501
Beat it, doc.

879
01:23:56,302 --> 01:23:59,739
You murdering bastards!

880
01:24:02,736 --> 01:24:03,904
Bastard!

881
01:24:05,902 --> 01:24:07,805
You are...

882
01:24:39,769 --> 01:24:40,702
I'll get you.

883
01:24:41,701 --> 01:24:42,902
Okay, you old hippie, get out!

884
01:24:42,903 --> 01:24:45,168
What's up?

885
01:24:45,169 --> 01:24:47,569
Oh, Stubbsy, you bastard.
It's only a party.

886
01:24:47,570 --> 01:24:48,935
Bloody maniacs.

887
01:24:49,934 --> 01:24:51,845
What do you want with me, doc?

888
01:25:06,168 --> 01:25:07,669
Bloody cow...

889
01:25:08,668 --> 01:25:09,934
You bloody coward!

890
01:25:09,935 --> 01:25:11,208
Whoa!

891
01:25:21,601 --> 01:25:23,182
Get off.

892
01:25:36,169 --> 01:25:38,168
I need to...
Refrigeration.

893
01:26:07,467 --> 01:26:08,601
Doc.

894
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,302
Turn it off, turn it off.

895
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:18,267
No.

896
01:26:18,268 --> 01:26:19,807
No, no...

897
01:28:13,833 --> 01:28:14,732
Going?

898
01:28:17,166 --> 01:28:18,569
- Yes.
- Where?

899
01:28:21,566 --> 01:28:22,607
Sydney.

900
01:28:30,599 --> 01:28:31,840
Sydney.

901
01:28:39,832 --> 01:28:43,697
You want some food
before you go?

902
01:28:45,165 --> 01:28:46,266
No.

903
01:28:47,265 --> 01:28:48,733
How about a drink?

904
01:28:58,833 --> 01:29:01,700
Hey, don't forget your gun.

905
01:29:02,699 --> 01:29:03,798
What?

906
01:29:05,565 --> 01:29:07,083
The boys made you
a present of the gun.

907
01:29:19,865 --> 01:29:20,923
Bye.

908
01:30:19,864 --> 01:30:20,963
Better?

909
01:30:21,732 --> 01:30:22,831
Yes, better.

910
01:30:25,798 --> 01:30:27,230
Thanks, mate.

911
01:30:27,231 --> 01:30:28,130
Have another one.

912
01:30:28,832 --> 01:30:30,830
Oh...

913
01:30:30,831 --> 01:30:31,911
No, I don't really like to.

914
01:30:33,665 --> 01:30:35,571
One more beer, thanks, Joyce.

915
01:30:41,565 --> 01:30:44,496
Jock, you damn near saved
my life just now, how about

916
01:30:44,497 --> 01:30:46,471
completing the job by
giving me a cigarette, huh?

917
01:30:52,465 --> 01:30:53,607
Thanks.

918
01:31:02,597 --> 01:31:05,731
I thought you were pulling out
of the yabba on Saturday.

919
01:31:05,732 --> 01:31:07,833
Hmm? Oh, yes,
yes, I was.

920
01:31:09,831 --> 01:31:11,533
What went wrong?

921
01:31:13,531 --> 01:31:14,431
Oh, I got involved.

922
01:31:22,164 --> 01:31:23,264
Hey, there's my suitcases.

923
01:31:23,265 --> 01:31:24,896
Yours, are they?

924
01:31:24,897 --> 01:31:26,136
Yes. I left them
here yesterday.

925
01:31:26,297 --> 01:31:27,196
No.

926
01:31:28,897 --> 01:31:30,599
No, not yesterday.

927
01:31:32,597 --> 01:31:33,895
No, it's the other day.

928
01:31:33,896 --> 01:31:35,829
They've been
here since Saturday.

929
01:31:35,830 --> 01:31:38,498
Look, if John says they're
his, then they're his.

930
01:31:39,497 --> 01:31:40,731
What's in them, John?

931
01:31:40,732 --> 01:31:42,198
Oh, it's clothes.

932
01:31:43,197 --> 01:31:44,269
Books.

933
01:31:50,263 --> 01:31:51,343
Couple of schooners, Joyce.

934
01:32:03,164 --> 01:32:06,198
Like he said, books.

935
01:32:08,196 --> 01:32:09,756
Not that I doubted you,
of course, John.

936
01:32:23,564 --> 01:32:25,403
Is there anywhere
I can get a shower and shave?

937
01:33:01,695 --> 01:33:02,824
Thanks, mate.

938
01:35:10,695 --> 01:35:12,693
Right, thanks a lot.

939
01:35:12,694 --> 01:35:14,492
- Come and have a drink, mate.
- No, thanks.

940
01:35:14,493 --> 01:35:15,660
- Come and have a drink.
- Not interested...

941
01:35:15,661 --> 01:35:17,260
It will only take a minute.

942
01:35:17,261 --> 01:35:18,826
Come on, come and have a drink.

943
01:35:18,827 --> 01:35:21,725
Look, mate, I've given
up drinking for a while.

944
01:35:21,726 --> 01:35:22,826
What's wrong with you,
you bastard?

945
01:35:22,827 --> 01:35:24,225
Why don't you come
and drink with me?

946
01:35:24,226 --> 01:35:27,159
I just brought you 50 miles eating
dust, and you won't drink with me.

947
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:28,625
What's wrong with you?

948
01:35:28,626 --> 01:35:30,461
What's the matter
with you people, huh?

949
01:35:30,462 --> 01:35:32,926
You sponge on you...

950
01:35:32,927 --> 01:35:34,726
You burn your house down,
murder your wife,

951
01:35:34,727 --> 01:35:36,725
rape your child,
that's all right.

952
01:35:36,726 --> 01:35:38,691
But don't have a drink with
you, don't have a flaming,

953
01:35:38,692 --> 01:35:40,193
bloody drink with you,
that's a criminal offense,

954
01:35:40,194 --> 01:35:42,195
that's the end of
the bloody world.

955
01:35:43,194 --> 01:35:44,153
You're mad, you bastard.

956
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:28,917
Hey. The gent here wants to know
who owns that semi-trailer.

957
01:36:29,894 --> 01:36:31,266
Who wants to know?

958
01:36:37,260 --> 01:36:38,228
Excuse me.

959
01:36:40,226 --> 01:36:42,826
You, uh...
You own the semi-trailer?

960
01:36:42,827 --> 01:36:44,492
What of it?

961
01:36:44,493 --> 01:36:46,459
Well, nothing, uh...

962
01:36:46,460 --> 01:36:48,231
I wanted to see if you
could give me a lift.

963
01:36:53,226 --> 01:36:54,592
Where you going?

964
01:36:54,593 --> 01:36:55,926
Right through.

965
01:36:55,927 --> 01:36:57,492
To the city, I mean.

966
01:36:57,493 --> 01:36:59,558
Well, I'm going
to the city myself.

967
01:36:59,559 --> 01:37:00,679
- Oh.
- How much is it worth?

968
01:37:03,526 --> 01:37:06,557
I am afraid I'm broke, that's
why I'm begging rides.

969
01:37:06,558 --> 01:37:09,158
Should be worth at
least a couple of dollars.

970
01:37:09,159 --> 01:37:10,358
Well, it would be, yes, but...

971
01:37:10,894 --> 01:37:12,458
But I'm really flat.

972
01:37:12,459 --> 01:37:13,664
Make it $2 and we're sweet.

973
01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:19,497
Look, I've got $1.

974
01:37:23,493 --> 01:37:25,690
I... I've got a rifle.
I'll give you that.

975
01:37:25,691 --> 01:37:26,816
What sort of rifle?

976
01:37:49,793 --> 01:37:51,461
All right,
you ride in the back.

977
01:37:53,459 --> 01:37:54,458
Okay. Thanks.

978
01:38:18,825 --> 01:38:19,828
Hey, you, we're there.

979
01:38:21,826 --> 01:38:22,725
There?

980
01:38:36,526 --> 01:38:37,827
You know...

981
01:38:38,826 --> 01:38:40,593
I thought you said you
were going to Sydney.

982
01:38:41,592 --> 01:38:42,659
Don't know why.

983
01:38:43,658 --> 01:38:44,828
You said city, mate.

984
01:38:46,626 --> 01:38:47,865
Bundanyabba's a city, ain't it?

985
01:39:04,225 --> 01:39:06,831
Well, at least the trip
cost you nothing.

986
01:42:19,457 --> 01:42:21,455
Hey!

987
01:42:47,523 --> 01:42:49,290
<i>I, uh, hate to
trouble you, John,</i>

988
01:42:50,289 --> 01:42:51,822
but rather than tire you,

989
01:42:51,823 --> 01:42:54,155
I thought I'd
write down what had

990
01:42:54,156 --> 01:42:55,857
happened and you
could sign it, okay?

991
01:42:56,856 --> 01:43:01,155
"The gunshot wound to my head
was the result of an accident.

992
01:43:01,156 --> 01:43:05,453
"I was visiting my friend, Clarence F.
Tydon, after a hunting trip.

993
01:43:05,454 --> 01:43:07,932
"I dropped my .22 rifle at the
floor of his kitchen butt first,

994
01:43:08,723 --> 01:43:10,754
"believing it to be unloaded.

995
01:43:10,755 --> 01:43:13,258
"It exploded,
and that's all I remember."

996
01:43:15,256 --> 01:43:16,535
That'll be about it,
wouldn't it?

997
01:43:20,189 --> 01:43:21,089
Here.

998
01:43:55,222 --> 01:43:56,919
You'd think a bloke
who'd won a silver medal

999
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:59,153
at target shooting
could hit himself

1000
01:43:59,154 --> 01:44:00,673
in the head at
a range of three inches.

1001
01:44:04,623 --> 01:44:05,522
Give me that.

1002
01:44:36,854 --> 01:44:37,836
Don't wanna miss it.

1003
01:45:26,155 --> 01:45:27,623
Hey, mate.

1004
01:45:28,622 --> 01:45:30,687
- You like a beer?
- Oh.

1005
01:45:31,686 --> 01:45:32,819
Thanks.

1006
01:45:32,820 --> 01:45:33,719
Here's cheers.

1007
01:46:22,621 --> 01:46:24,186
Hello, Charlie.

1008
01:46:24,187 --> 01:46:25,522
Did you have a good holiday?

1009
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:28,688
The best.
