1
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,210
- Mr. Szpilman? - Hello.

2
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,920
I came specially to meet you. I love your playing.

3
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:19,010
- Who are you? - My name's Dorota, Jurek's sister.

4
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,720
- You're bleeding! - It's nothing.

5
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,890
You can write him a fan letter later. This isn't the best time. Come on.

6
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,650
Jurek, where have you been hiding her?

7
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,610
- I don't know what to take. - You always take too much.

8
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,910
How many suitcases are you taking?

9
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,120
What do you think, should I take uncle Szymon's portrait?

10
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,460
Take it, don't take it, take what you like.

11
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,080
Can't you see I'm worried sick?

12
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,040
He'll come home, he'll be alright.

13
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,220
- I should have another case. - Mama, Wladek is home!

14
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,720
Thank God. Wladek! You're wounded?

15
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,060
- No, it was nothing. - I've been worried sick.

16
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,810
I told her not to worry. You had your papers on you.

17
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,890
If you'd been hit by a bomb, they'd know where to take you.

18
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:13,150
Henryk, don't say things like that. God forbid. God forbid.

19
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,400
- Papa, Wladek is home. - What did I tell you?

20
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,030
- What are you doing? - Where's my hat with the wide brim?

21
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:23,950
- They've bombed us. We're off the air. - Warsaw is not the only radio station.

22
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,000
Pack, darling. Get your things packed.

23
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,250
- Where are we going? - Out of Warsaw.

24
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,080
- Out of Warsaw where? - You haven't heard?

25
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,920
- Heard what? - Haven't you seen the paper?

26
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,630
- Where's the paper? - I used it for packing.

27
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,340
- She used it for packing. - The government has moved to Lublin.

28
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,970
All men must leave the city, go across the river, set up a new line of defense.

29
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,100
There isn't anybody left here, only the women. The men are all gone.

30
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,940
What do you think you'll do while they set up a new line of defense?

31
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,440
- Wonder around with your suitcases? - Pack, Wladek. There's no time.

32
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,440
- I'm not going anywhere. - Good. I'm not going anywhere either.

33
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,280
Don't be ridiculous, we've got to keep together.

34
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,830
Look. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die in my own home, staying put.

35
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,910
- God forbid. - Shut up, I've got something. Listen.

36
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,290
...from the BBC in London. The British government...

37
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,840
having received no reply to the observations presented...

38
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,300
to the German government...

39
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,470
has declared war on nazi Germany.

40
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,430
- That's wonderful! Wonderful! - It is expected that...

41
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,530
...within the next few hours, France will make a similar declaration.

42
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,110
Poland is no longer alone.

43
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,540
Wonderful, wonderful!

44
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,170
- Mama, that was a great dinner. - It certainly was.

45
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,880
When there's something to celebrate, you've got to make an effort.

46
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,050
Here's to Great Britain and France!

47
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,050
Didn't I tell you? Didn't I tell you? All will be well.

48
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,510
Five thousand and three.

49
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,840
- Is that all? - Yes. It's all we've got left.

50
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,220
- It's 3,003 too much. - Look.

51
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,810
"Further restrictions regarding liquid assets.

52
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,230
Jews will be allowed to keep a maximum of 2,000 zlotys at home. "

53
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,940
- What do we do with the rest? - Deposit it in a bank. Blocked account.

54
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,900
Banks! Who'd be stupid enough to deposit money in a German bank?

55
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,740
We could hide the money. Look here. We can hide it under the flowerpots.

56
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,000
I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll use try and tested methods.

57
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,620
You know what we did in the last war?

58
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,710
We made a hole in the table leg, and hid the money in there.

59
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,380
- Suppose they take the table away? - What do you mean?

60
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:27,180
Germans go into Jewish homes and take furniture, valuables, anything.

61
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:30,180
- Do they? - Why'd they want a table like this?

62
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:34,430
- What on earth are you doing? - Listen. Look.

63
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:38,730
This is the best place. No-one would think of looking under the flowerpot.

64
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,070
- No, listen. I've been thinking... - Really? That's a change.

65
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,570
- You know what? We use psychology. - We use what?

66
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,700
We leave the money and the watch on the table, covered. In full view.

67
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,460
- Are you stupid? - The Germans will never notice it.

68
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,590
That's the stupidest thing I've ever seen. Of course they'll notice. Look.

69
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,170
Look here.

70
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,260
Idiot.

71
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,300
- And you call me stupid. - Very good. That's the last place...

72
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,600
- This would take hours. - We're not in a hurry.

73
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,020
- It won't take hours. - How will you get them out? Tell me.

74
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,270
- How will you get them out? - Quiet! Order, please!

75
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,190
- You reach them out individually. - No-one listens to me!

76
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,230
Quiet, please, quiet. Order, order, please.

77
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,700
- The lawyer, she likes order. - Listen, just listen. Look.

78
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,490
The watch we put under the flowerpot and the money we stuff in the violin.

79
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:38,160
- But I'll still be able to play? - You'll find out.

80
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:42,130
- Jurek? It's Wladek Szpilman. - Wladek, how are you?

81
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,380
We're fine, thank you. And you?

82
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:49,840
Fine, under the circumstances. I guess I know why you're calling.

83
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:54,220
There's nothing we can do. They won't reopen the station.

84
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:59,190
- Yes, I know, but I... - No music, no radio for the Polish.

85
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,690
But sure you'll find work. A pianist like you.

86
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,320
Maybe, maybe not, but...

87
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,660
don't be offended, but I didn't call to discuss my future carrier.

88
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,080
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks, and at last he gave in and said...

89
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,450
"All right, come with me tomorrow", so I came and...

90
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,040
they bombed the station.

91
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,750
- Meeting you like that was wonderful. - Really?

92
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,420
Yes, it was unforgettable.

93
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,220
- I love your playing, Mr. Szpilman. - Call me Wladek, please.

94
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,680
- No-one plays Chopin like you. - I hope it's a compliment.

95
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:38,560
- Of course, I mean it. - I was... trying to be funny.

96
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:43,060
- Should we go and have a coffee? - I'd like that.

97
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,360
- And you, what do you do? - I finished with the conservatoire.

98
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,530
- You're a musician? - Yes. But only just.

99
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,320
- What instrument? - The cello.

100
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,120
I love to see women playing the cello.

101
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,540
JEWS FORBIDDEN

102
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,000
This is disgraceful. How dare they?

103
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:08,050
You know what people are like, they want to be better nazis than Hitler.

104
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:12,130
- I'm going in there to complain. - It's better not, believe me.

105
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,640
- It's humiliating. Someone like you! - Good-bye.

106
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,440
We'll find somewhere else.

107
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,940
- We can walk in the park. - No, we can't.

108
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,480
Official decree. No Jews allowed in the park.

109
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,820
- My God. Are you joking? - I'm not joking, it's true.

110
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:37,910
We could sit in a bench, but "no Jews allowed on public benches".

111
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,950
This is absurd.

112
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:46,080
We can just stand here and talk. I think we're allowed to do that.

113
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,630
So, you play the cello. That's nice. And who's your favorite composer?

114
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,180
Chopin? Really? Well...

115
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,300
you'll have to learn to play his cello sonata, won't you?

116
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,640
What about you, Wladek?

117
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,810
Perhaps I could accompany. Me on the piano, you on the cello.

118
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,360
Mr. Szpilman, you're quite, quite wonderful.

119
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,650
Call me Wladek, please.

120
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,530
"Free emblems for Jews in the Warsaw district.

121
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,660
I hereby order that all Jews in the Warsaw district...

122
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,120
will wear visible emblems when out of doors.

123
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:27,170
This decree will come into force on the first of December, 1939...

124
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,800
and applies to all Jews over 12 years of age.

125
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,380
The emblem will be worn on the right sleeve...

126
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:38,340
and will represent the blue star of David on a white background.

127
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:42,060
The background must be sufficiently large...

128
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,020
for the star to measure eight centimeters from point to point.

129
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,730
The width of the arms of the star must be one centimeter.

130
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:56,280
The Jews that do not respect this decree will be severely punished.

131
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:01,280
Governor of the Warsaw district, Dr. Fischer. "

132
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,750
- I won't wear it. - I'm not going to be branded.

133
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,840
Let me see this.

134
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,970
Does it say that we have to provide these armbands ourselves?

135
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,940
- Where will we get them? - We're not going to wear them.

136
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,860
You!

137
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,080
Come here.

138
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,380
Why haven't you greeted us?

139
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,460
I'm sorry.

140
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,770
The sidewalk is forbidden for you.

141
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,060
Go to the gutter.

142
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:29,410
- Have you seen this? - What? What? I'm working. What?

143
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,710
What is this?

144
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,630
- It's where they're going to put us. - What do you mean "put us"?

145
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,760
"By order of the governor of the Warsaw district, Dr. Fischer...

146
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:47,640
concerning the establishment of the Jewish district in Warsaw.

147
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:53,480
There'll be created a Jewish district in which Jews will have to reside. "

148
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,190
Look here. "Jews living outside of the prescribed area...

149
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,700
will have to move to the Jewish district by 31 of October, 1940."

150
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,120
They won't get all of us. It's too small.

151
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,330
There's 400 thousand of us in Warsaw.

152
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,080
No, 360 thousand. So it will be easy.

153
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:17,170
What am I supposed to do? You tell me.

154
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,720
Mama?

155
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:26,010
Mama, what is it?

156
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,600
20 zlotys!

157
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,060
That's all we have left, 20 zlotys.

158
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:40,820
What can I buy with 20 zlotys?

159
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:45,490
I'm sick of cooking potatoes, potatoes, potatoes.

160
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:56,170
That's the price. That's what I'm offering.

161
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:59,090
My advice is to accept. You won't get more from anyone else.

162
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,220
- But it's a Bechstein! - 2 thousand. My advice is to take it.

163
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:06,430
What are you going to do when you're hungry? Eat the piano?

164
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,430
- Get out! - What's the matter with you?

165
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,560
- Stop it! - We'd rather give it away. Get out!

166
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,940
Haven't you eaten today? What are you suffering from?

167
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,810
You people are crazy.

168
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,030
I'm doing you a favor. Two thousand and I'm paying for the removal.

169
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,820
I'm not even charging for the removal!

170
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,280
You haven't eaten today. You're crazy.

171
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,330
Take it.

172
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,570
Hello.

173
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,030
Hello. Hi.

174
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,450
I didn't want to come.

175
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:19,250
I didn't want to see all this, but... I couldn't stop myself.

176
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,380
- How are you doing? - Fine.

177
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,590
Good.

178
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,470
No, not really. They arrested my cousin.

179
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,050
Jurek says they'll let him out.

180
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:35,890
- This is disgraceful. - It won't last long. Don't worry.

181
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,060
That's what I said myself.

182
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,940
It's too absurd.

183
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:49,110
I... I should go.

184
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,910
Well, I'll see you...

185
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,870
soon.

186
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,670
Good-bye.

187
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,980
Well...

188
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:23,270
to tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.

189
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:33,910
- Where will we sleep? - I sleep in the kitchen with the girls.

190
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,120
You, Henryk and papa, in here.

191
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,670
Look.

192
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,210
Come and look.

193
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,450
Go away.

194
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,910
Go away! Go away!

195
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,170
Papa! Papa!

196
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:44,480
- Sell anything? - Just one. Dostoievski, "The Idiot".

197
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,320
- 3 zlotys. - It's better than yesterday.

198
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,780
Three lousy zlotys. And there are people there making millions.

199
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,660
- I know. - You don't know, believe me.

200
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,280
They bribe the guards, the guards turn a blind eye.

201
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:03,290
They bring cartloads of food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics.

202
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,290
And the poor are dying all around and they don't give a damn.

203
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:09,300
Excuse me, have you seen my husband, Izaak Szerman?

204
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:13,720
A tall handsome man, with a little gray beard.

205
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:18,470
- I'm afraid not. - Excuse me. Good-bye.

206
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,350
Sleep well. But if you see him, write to me, yes?

207
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,600
Izaak Szerman.

208
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,830
Why do we have to have a gentile street running through our area?

209
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,210
Why can't they go around?

210
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:49,130
Don't worry. They're about to build a bridge. Haven't you heard?

211
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,050
A bridge! Those idiots.

212
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,840
The Germans claim to be intelligent.

213
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:59,550
But do you know what I think? I think they're totally stupid.

214
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,770
I have a family to feed. I spend half of my time here...

215
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,230
waiting for them to let us through.

216
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,690
Maybe they think I come here to listen to the music?

217
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:14,070
- What is it? Are you in a hurry? - What's wrong with you?

218
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,570
- Come on, do something. - Right. Dance!

219
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,530
- Dance! - Dance!

220
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,660
Come on, come on! Dance!

221
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,710
Very well.

222
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,880
What about you? Dance with him.

223
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:37,630
Let's clear the street, so the Jews can dance.

224
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,220
Come on. And you.

225
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,020
Go on.

226
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,530
Faster!

227
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,400
Come on!

228
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,110
Faster!

229
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,700
Come on!

230
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,210
Faster!

231
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,130
Come on, move! I said faster! Come on, Jews!

232
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,340
- Keep dancing. - Dance.

233
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,860
Good, they're here.

234
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,530
Itzak Heller has been waiting for you.

235
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,290
- What's this about? - Sit down, have tea.

236
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,960
I'll start lunch when the girls get here.

237
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,180
- So, what are you doing here? - He brought cakes.

238
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:10,020
His father is back in the jewellery business. He's doing well.

239
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,980
Amazing, jewellery.

240
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,570
- We're recruiting. - Who is recruiting?

241
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,240
Don't be clever with me. I'm coming as a friend.

242
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,660
They're bringing Jews in from all over the country.

243
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,910
Soon there will be half million people in the ghetto.

244
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,080
- We need more Jewish police. - More Jewish police!

245
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:32,790
You want me to beat up Jews and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see.

246
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,540
- Someone has got to do it. - But why me?

247
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,130
I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers.

248
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,340
Look at my father, look at us...

249
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:43,680
I'm looking at you, that's why I'm here. You can have a better life.

250
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:47,310
- You want to survive selling books? - Yes, please.

251
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,890
I'm doing you people a favor.

252
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,850
What about you? You're a great pianist.

253
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,520
We've got a police jazz band. They'd welcome you with open arms.

254
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:59,900
- Join us. You've got no work. - Thank you, I've got work.

255
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,120
I'm sorry, he wants you to stop.

256
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,080
Who wants me to stop?

257
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,180
I always say, look on the bright side.

258
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:52,810
You're in a small ghetto with intellectuals, professional people.

259
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:56,560
You're better off than us. Here in the large ghetto it's a cesspool.

260
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,900
- You have to give me something. - You're an artist...

261
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,150
you keep peoples' spirits up. You do enough.

262
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,900
- I want to help, do something. - You're too well known.

263
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:11,030
And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators.

264
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,370
You're too... too musical.

265
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,340
- Who is that? - Symche.

266
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,710
Majorek.

267
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,930
There are notices going up. City is to be cleansed of the undesirables.

268
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:32,140
- There's always notices going up. - Hello, Symche.

269
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,520
Dyrek. Mrs. Ysken.

270
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:40,350
Jehuda, working hard?

271
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,520
This is the greatest pianist in Poland. Maybe the whole world.

272
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:47,650
Wladyslaw Szpilman, meet Majorek.

273
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,700
- How do you do? - I know your name.

274
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,410
- I've never heard you play. - Majorek used to be in the Army.

275
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,620
Brilliant man. The only thing I've got against him is he's not a socialist.

276
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,380
You better go now, Wladek. It's nearly curfew.

277
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,340
You know how many copies we print of our newspaper?

278
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,550
Five hundred.

279
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,050
You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.

280
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:17,890
That makes 10 thousand readers. This will start the uprising.

281
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,350
Majorek hides them in his underpants and leaves them in toilets.

282
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,400
- Toilets? - As many toilets as I can find.

283
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:27,150
Germans never use Jewish toilets.

284
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,360
They're too clean for them.

285
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,120
Please, mister, please.

286
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,690
Hold it! You little bastard!

287
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,660
Take this!

288
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,870
Stop it! Stop it!

289
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,870
Stop it!

290
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,830
Come on, come on. Come on, boy.

291
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,840
Stand up! Stand up.

292
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:09,460
Please, tonight for once, I don't want anything bad talked about.

293
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:13,210
- Enjoy your meal. - Then I'll tell you something funny.

294
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:16,430
- You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja? - The surgeon.

295
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:21,470
The Germans allowed him into the ghetto to perform an operation.

296
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,850
On a Jew? They let a Pole to come in to operate on a Jew?

297
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,480
He got a pass, that's all I know. Anyway, so...

298
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,070
he puts the patient to sleep and starts the operation.

299
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,570
He'd just made the first incision when the SS burst in...

300
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:38,360
shoot the patient, then Dr. Raszeja and everybody else who was there.

301
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,160
Isn't that a laugh?

302
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,290
The patient didn't feel a thing, he was anesthetized.

303
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,290
I said nothing bad.

304
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,710
What's the matter with you all? You lost your sense of humor?

305
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,590
It's not funny.

306
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,220
You know what's funny? You're funny, with that ridiculous tie.

307
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,600
What are you talking about? What's my tie have to do with anything?

308
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:07,060
- I need this tie for my work. - Your work?

309
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:11,560
- That's right, I work. - Playing the piano for the parasites.

310
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:14,940
- Parasites... - Boys. Boys!

311
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,700
- They don't give a damn. - And you blame me for their apathy?

312
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,410
I see it everyday. They don't even notice what's going around them.

313
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,580
- I blame the Americans. - For what? For my tie?

314
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,960
The American Jews, and there are lots of them.

315
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,250
What do they think they're doing? People here are dying.

316
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,750
Haven't got a bite to eat.

317
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:39,260
The Jewish bankers should persuade America to declare war on Germany.

318
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:58,360
The lights! The lights!

319
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:20,510
Turn on the lights.

320
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,890
Come on!

321
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:33,150
Open the door! We want to go in!

322
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,980
Open the door!

323
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,870
Stand up!

324
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,630
You, stand up! Come on!

325
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,840
Throw him out!

326
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,190
Mama...

327
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:33,000
Come on, run!

328
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:44,240
- I'm Mr. Szpilman's sister. - Go in. Not you.

329
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,170
- What? - Come. It's terrible.

330
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:09,510
- What? - They're hunting people in the streets.

331
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,970
They've taken Henryk.

332
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,600
Go home, alright? Go home, I'll take care of it.

333
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,950
Excuse me. Have you seen my husband? Izaak Szerman?

334
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,040
- I'm afraid not. - Tall, handsome, little gray beard.

335
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:39,960
If you see him, write to me. Don't forget. Izaak Szerman.

336
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,720
What happened here?

337
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:55,680
They've got my grandson. They pick them up and take them away.

338
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:59,600
What they do to them, I've stopped believing in God.

339
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,310
Excuse me. Excuse me.

340
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,230
Itzak?

341
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,360
Itzak?

342
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:12,070
Itzak, it's Wladek Szpilman.

343
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:20,870
- Henryk is in there. - I haven't seen him.

344
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,250
Believe me. They picked him up.

345
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:31,590
- Can you help? - Now you need me. Now you need me!

346
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,010
Can you help us?

347
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,390
- It costs. - I have no money.

348
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,190
Then there's nothing I can do. You should have joined us.

349
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:44,810
- They told me you had influence. - Who told you?

350
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:48,570
People I know. They said you're an important man.

351
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,700
Itzak...

352
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,550
- Hands up. - How are you?

353
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,470
- How are you? - You, bandit.

354
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,850
Dead! Dead!

355
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:22,270
- He's crazy. - Hands up.

356
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,610
- Want a cigarette? - Cigarette?

357
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:29,110
Thank you.

358
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:33,780
Everything is alright!

359
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:36,120
He looks very happy.

360
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,200
Everything is alright.

361
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,830
Everything is alright.

362
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:46,960
Hands up! Hands up!

363
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,840
It's alright.

364
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,840
Help! Help!

365
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:56,680
Let go! Help!

366
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:53,440
- Why did they pick you up? - So you go to Itzak Heller?

367
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:57,200
- Did I ask you to talk to him? - You're out, aren't you?

368
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:02,330
- Did you beg to that piece of shit? - I asked him to help you.

369
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:05,210
What did you pay him?

370
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,670
With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food.

371
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,920
- I can look after myself. - They were taking you away.

372
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:18,050
It's got nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you.

373
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,600
Why do you have to interfere with other people's business?

374
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,930
- You're mad. That's your trouble. - That's also my business.

375
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:38,490
What's the matter? Are you sick?

376
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,950
Hungry.

377
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:53,500
Employment certificate. What's that mean, no employment certificate?

378
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:56,550
You have to have an employment certificate...

379
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,340
to work for the Germans in the ghetto, otherwise...

380
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,390
- Otherwise what? - You'll be deported.

381
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,930
- So the rumors were true. - They're going to resettle us...

382
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,980
and send us to labor camps, in the East.

383
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,900
- They're closing the small ghetto. - Oh, God!

384
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:32,130
Wladek? Wladek?

385
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:37,090
I thought you were on tour playing in London, Paris, New York, Chicago.

386
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,090
- Not this week. - You look terrible.

387
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:43,260
Have you heard the rumors? They're going to resettle us in the East.

388
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:47,600
Rumors! You take it all too much to heart. What's the trouble?

389
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:52,230
I've been trying to get the certificate of employment for my father.

390
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,820
I managed to get one for me and my family, but I need one for my father.

391
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:59,240
- I've been to all the firms and shops... - Why didn't you come to me?

392
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:01,610
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.

393
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,280
I'm not, but Majorek is.

394
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:08,580
Can you help? I have no money.

395
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:12,170
Please, don't insult us. Can you do something for him?

396
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,790
Be at the Schultz workshop tomorrow, four o'clock.

397
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,750
See what a wonderful piece of luck you've had today?

398
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,840
That's the historical imperative in action! That's why I always say:

399
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,430
- "Look on the bright side!" - Yes, I know.

400
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:40,150
- How's your back? - Better.

401
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,360
Better?

402
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,530
Better not ask.

403
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:02,720
- Thank you. - My pleasure. Won't help you anyway.

404
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,510
Thank you, Mr. Schultz.

405
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,540
At least we got work in the ghetto.

406
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,920
At least we are still together.

407
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,610
Everybody out! To the courtyard!

408
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:44,190
Move, move!

409
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:49,160
We are workers. We have employment certification.

410
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,080
Wait.

411
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:56,830
Here.

412
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,250
Go over there. Hurry.

413
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,460
You.

414
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,550
You. You.

415
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,130
You.

416
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,760
You.

417
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,350
You.

418
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:28,610
The others, put your clothes on and come back here.

419
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,030
Bring your things with you. 15 kilos only.

420
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,160
Where are you taking us?

421
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:01,440
I'm sorry, I did my best.

422
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:06,820
- I thought the certificates'd save us. - Stop it, Wladek.

423
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:10,610
Let's just hope that Henryk and Halina will be better off.

424
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,480
- Where will we be going? - You're going to work.

425
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,060
You'll be much better off than in the stinking ghetto. Move.

426
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:52,650
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

427
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:58,740
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

428
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,580
Why did I do it?

429
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,500
Don't you have a bottle of water? He's dying.

430
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,630
My child is dying of thirst.

431
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,720
- I beg you. - I'm sorry.

432
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,800
- Don't you have water? I beg you. - Can you hear what I'm saying?

433
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:00,310
- I'm telling you, it's a disgrace. - I can hear you.

434
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:02,850
Letting them take us to our death like sheep to the slaughter.

435
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:05,190
- Not so loud. - Why don't we attack them?

436
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:08,560
There's half a million of us here. We can break out of the ghetto.

437
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:11,480
At least we can die honorably, not as a stain on the face of History.

438
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,400
Why are you so sure they're sending us to our death?

439
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,200
You know why I'm not sure? Because they didn't tell me.

440
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:21,450
- They're going to wipe us all out. - What do you want me to do? Fight?

441
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,290
To fight, we need organization, plans, guns.

442
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:27,120
He's right. Do you think I'm going to fight with my violin bowl?

443
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:30,170
The Germans would never squander a huge labor force like this.

444
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,800
They're sending us to a labor camp, it's obvious.

445
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,380
Sure.

446
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:38,970
Look at that cripple, the old people, the children. They're going to work?

447
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:42,970
Look at you. You're going to carry logs on your back?

448
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:28,270
Henryk! Halina, Henryk!

449
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:42,620
I missed you. I wanted to be with you!

450
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,960
I wanted to be with you!

451
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:56,250
Stupid. Stupid.

452
00:45:56,630 --> 00:46:00,880
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

453
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:04,350
She's getting on my nerves.

454
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:13,310
- What did she do, for God's sake? - She smothered her baby.

455
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:18,860
They prepared a hiding place and of course they went there.

456
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:21,950
The baby cried just as the police came.

457
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:26,330
She smothered the cries with her hands, the baby died.

458
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:31,370
A policeman heard the death rattle and found where they were hiding.

459
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,820
What are you reading?

460
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:06,120
"If you prick us, de we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

461
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,540
If you poison us, do we not die?

462
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:11,870
And, if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?"

463
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:23,010
- Very appropriate. - Yes. That's why I brought it.

464
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:44,490
Idiot. What does he think he's gonna do with the money?

465
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:48,320
Boy, come here.

466
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,870
Come here.

467
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,210
- How much for a caramel? - 20 zlotys.

468
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,880
For one caramel? What do you think you're gonna do with the money?

469
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,380
20 zlotys.

470
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,130
We've got 20 between us.

471
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,890
I've got 10, I think.

472
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,430
5, 10, 20.

473
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:37,980
- Halina? - What?

474
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:43,310
- It's a funny time to say this, but... - What?

475
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,860
I wish I knew you better.

476
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,620
Thank you.

477
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:10,720
Szpilman?

478
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:22,850
Papa? Papa?

479
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,650
Mama? Halina?

480
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:30,820
Halina? Mama?

481
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:36,450
What do you think you're doing? I've saved your life. Just go! Go!

482
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,370
Don't run!

483
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:46,040
Anna!

484
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,590
Anna!

485
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:11,440
Off they go to the melting pot.

486
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:19,240
- This stays. - Give it to me!

487
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:27,090
What are you doing? She's pregnant.

488
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:56,070
Wladek?

489
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:17,340
Why are you here, Wladek?

490
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:20,260
It's like this, I...

491
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:23,850
We...

492
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:29,060
All of them, all of them.

493
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:31,480
All of them.

494
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,570
Perhaps they're lucky. The quicker, the better.

495
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:39,940
It's not finished yet. We'll stay here for a couple of days...

496
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:42,160
until things die down.

497
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:45,870
I've bribed the policeman, he'll come when it's over.

498
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:51,830
Attention! On the march!

499
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,800
Onward!

500
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:09,310
My God, I haven't been outside in, it must be two years.

501
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,520
Don't get overexcited.

502
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:31,700
It's gold. Very good price.

503
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:54,730
Someone you know?

504
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:56,900
A beauty. Who is she?

505
00:55:57,110 --> 00:56:01,190
She's a singer. I knew her well. Her husband is an actor.

506
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,860
They're good people. I'd like to talk to her.

507
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:07,910
Don't forget, Wladek. They hang them for helping Jews.

508
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:37,150
Turn left!

509
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,810
On the march!

510
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:46,780
Stop! Halt! Attention!

511
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:57,040
At ease.

512
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:03,920
Turn right!

513
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:13,810
Step forward.

514
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:15,930
You.

515
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:20,770
You. You.

516
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,320
You.

517
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,360
Down on the ground!

518
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:32,700
Down on the ground!

519
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:02,110
Turn left!

520
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:05,730
On the march.

521
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:48,030
How long have you been here?

522
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:51,150
Since last night.

523
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:53,780
I was pleased to see you.

524
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:01,040
They're going to start the final resettlement now.

525
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:05,210
We know what it means.

526
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:10,220
We sent someone out. Zygmund, a good man.

527
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:16,220
His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw.

528
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,770
He got to Sokolow.

529
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:24,730
A man told him the tracks divided, one branch's leading to Treblinka.

530
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,360
He said everyday freight trains carrying people from Warsaw...

531
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:34,570
branch off to Treblinka and return empty.

532
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:37,780
No transports of food are ever seen on that line.

533
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:42,040
The civilians are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station.

534
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,380
They're exterminating us.

535
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:54,880
It won't take them long.

536
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:59,850
We are 60 thousand left, out of half a million.

537
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,230
Mostly young people.

538
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,560
And this time we're gonna fight.

539
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:12,110
We're in good shape.

540
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:16,280
Organized. We're prepared.

541
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:19,330
If you need help, I...

542
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:42,140
You! Come here!

543
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:44,980
Shit!

544
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:55,400
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

545
01:00:56,530 --> 01:00:59,070
I don't know what I was thinking.

546
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:12,750
Take this! Take this!

547
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:30,230
Take him away.

548
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:49,540
I hope you play the piano better than you carry bricks.

549
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:53,800
He won't last long if he goes on like this.

550
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,920
I'll see if I can get him something better.

551
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:21,360
Trouble.

552
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:24,080
Round up only the Jews!

553
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:27,250
Round up! Only the Jews.

554
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,920
The Polish keep working. Only the Jews.

555
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:41,180
I have good news for you.

556
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:46,310
There are rumors going around that we like to...

557
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:49,430
to resettle you.

558
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:56,400
I promise you that now and in the future...

559
01:02:56,610 --> 01:03:00,200
nothing else is planned.

560
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:07,540
For this reason, we put information posters on the wall.

561
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:12,210
To show you our goodwill...

562
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:16,340
you should vote one of you to be allowed...

563
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:19,590
to go in town daily...

564
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:26,180
and bring 3 kilos of potatoes...

565
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:30,890
and one loaf of bread for each of your workers.

566
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:36,520
So, why should we do something like this if we'd resettle you?

567
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:43,110
You can make good business out of the things you don't eat.

568
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:50,290
Isn't that something that you Jews are good in? Making money?

569
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:55,420
Dismiss them.

570
01:04:11,770 --> 01:04:15,730
That one, with the string. The others, tied by wire.

571
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:25,630
Now!

572
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:05,170
Majorek.

573
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,840
I have a favor to ask.

574
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:12,850
I want to get out of here.

575
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:20,060
It's easy to get out. It's how you'll survive on the other side that's hard.

576
01:06:20,270 --> 01:06:22,560
I know.

577
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:27,240
Last summer, I worked for a day in the Zelazna Brama Square.

578
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:30,950
I saw someone I knew, she's an old friend.

579
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:34,620
A singer, her husband is an actor.

580
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:40,250
I've filled their names down and their address, if they're still there.

581
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:45,380
Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki. They're good people.

582
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:49,340
Would you try to make contact?

583
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:56,180
You go to town everyday. Ask them if they'd help me get out of here.

584
01:07:29,130 --> 01:07:31,840
Have you got any plaster?

585
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:44,480
What are you up to?

586
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:48,610
What have you got there?

587
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:52,780
We are allowed to take food to the ghetto.

588
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:55,820
Three kilos of potato and bread.

589
01:07:55,990 --> 01:07:58,120
Open it.

590
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:06,880
- It's only potatoes and bread. - You're lying. That's not true.

591
01:08:08,290 --> 01:08:10,460
Open it.

592
01:08:38,410 --> 01:08:40,620
Potatoes!

593
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:47,290
You Jews are all alike.

594
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:51,210
We reach you with a finger...

595
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:54,420
and you take the whole hand.

596
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:12,110
If you lie to me again, I'll kill you. Personally.

597
01:09:36,090 --> 01:09:38,380
I've tried your friends.

598
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:41,970
- They don't live there anymore. - Did you make contact?

599
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:44,640
- Be ready to leave. - When?

600
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:46,770
- Soon. - Halt!

601
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:50,360
Shit! Shit!

602
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:53,230
Wait. What's going on here?

603
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:57,110
Take this! Take this!

604
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:07,410
I'll teach you some discipline, you dirty Jews.

605
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:14,130
Do you know why you're being hit?

606
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:17,470
- No. - Do you know why you're being hit?

607
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:22,220
- Why? - To celebrate New Year.

608
01:10:24,510 --> 01:10:26,770
On the march!

609
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:29,600
March and sing!

610
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:31,770
Sing something nice!

611
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:35,480
Loud and clear!

612
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:40,320
Reunite tonight And follow the white eagle

613
01:10:40,530 --> 01:10:44,660
Stand up and fight Our mortal enemies

614
01:10:44,830 --> 01:10:48,710
Rise on the day Let's give them fire and brimstone

615
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:52,880
We'll do away The Yoke of slavery

616
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:56,840
Punish and rout The rapists of our nation

617
01:10:57,010 --> 01:11:01,180
We'll slash them out To save our dignity

618
01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:36,880
Come.

619
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:53,120
I'm sorry.

620
01:12:53,330 --> 01:12:56,080
I'm dirty. I'm so filthy.

621
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:24,070
We haven't much time. Come on.

622
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:33,660
We must hurry.

623
01:13:33,790 --> 01:13:36,160
Here. See if this fit.

624
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:40,500
We have to keep moving you. Germans are hunting down indiscriminately.

625
01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:43,960
Jews, non-Jews, anybody, everybody.

626
01:13:44,130 --> 01:13:48,090
You better shave. Use my razor on the shelf.

627
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:05,940
You'll be looked after by Gebczynski.

628
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:08,200
He's on the other side of town.

629
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:12,200
You stay there tonight, then we'll find you somewhere else.

630
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:17,120
- I'll bring you food. - Alright, let's go.

631
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:59,370
I'll show you where you're going to sleep.

632
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:32,700
You have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon.

633
01:15:32,910 --> 01:15:37,830
We have a flat for you near the ghetto wall. But it's safe.

634
01:15:45,130 --> 01:15:47,630
It's not going to be very comfortable.

635
01:15:48,170 --> 01:15:50,170
I'll be fine.

636
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:02,270
Thank you.

637
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:20,370
Here. Here. Give it to me.

638
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:25,000
Go as near to the front as possible, to the German section.

639
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:45,140
DO NOT PASS

640
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:19,010
I'm going to draw the curtains now.

641
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:28,270
But you leave them open during the day. Don't forget.

642
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:34,610
Must feel better on this side of the wall, eh?

643
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:36,360
Yes.

644
01:17:37,610 --> 01:17:42,200
But sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.

645
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:47,710
Some bread, potatoes, onions.

646
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:51,340
I'll come again. Janina will visit you twice a week.

647
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:54,010
To bring more food, see how you are.

648
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:56,510
Thank you.

649
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:02,060
This is very important. In case of emergency...

650
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:06,560
I mean emergency, go to this address.

651
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:51,310
What do you mean you forgot?

652
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:54,480
What do you think I mean? I forgot, that's what I mean.

653
01:18:54,610 --> 01:19:00,200
- You know, you treat me like dirt. - Because you are a dirt.

654
01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:02,870
- Pig! Pig! - Bitch!

655
01:19:03,070 --> 01:19:05,870
- Dirty pig! - You are a dirty pig!

656
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,790
Takes one to know one. Pig.

657
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:17,710
- You play like an angel. - Then why don't you listen?

658
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:20,130
- I'm listening. - Liar.

659
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:23,640
You fell asleep. Pig.

660
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:49,040
Spread out! We're being attacked!

661
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:53,960
Take cover!

662
01:19:55,630 --> 01:19:56,630
Shoot!

663
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:11,600
Take cover! Fire!

664
01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:18,570
Come on, get out!

665
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:48,410
The attack was successful.

666
01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:52,660
That building...

667
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:02,500
Turn that way!

668
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:11,140
Shoot!

669
01:22:35,370 --> 01:22:37,370
Thank you.

670
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:43,750
- I wanted to come earlier, but... - No, thank you.

671
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:51,640
No-one thought they'd hold out so long.

672
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,350
I never should've come out. I should have stayed and fought with them.

673
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:58,020
Wladek, stop that. It's over now.

674
01:22:58,180 --> 01:23:01,100
Just be proud of them.

675
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:04,860
- My God, did they put up a fight! - Yes.

676
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:09,740
- So did the Germans. - They are in shock!

677
01:23:09,950 --> 01:23:15,700
They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back.

678
01:23:15,870 --> 01:23:20,710
- Who would have thought? - What good did it do?

679
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:22,920
What good?

680
01:23:23,130 --> 01:23:25,550
Wladek, I'm surprised with you.

681
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:30,550
They died with dignity. And you know something else?

682
01:23:31,430 --> 01:23:35,640
Now the Poles will rise. We are ready.

683
01:23:35,850 --> 01:23:39,230
We'll fight too. You'll see.

684
01:23:53,490 --> 01:23:56,160
Get your things together. You have to leave.

685
01:23:56,370 --> 01:23:59,000
What? What's happened?

686
01:24:01,410 --> 01:24:03,710
- I'm on the run. - What's happened?

687
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:08,050
The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej.

688
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:12,800
They're bound to find out about this place too. You must get away at once.

689
01:24:13,010 --> 01:24:15,430
Where do you want me to go?

690
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:19,140
Look at me, I'm not leaving.

691
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:23,600
- Can I take my chances here? - That's your decision.

692
01:24:23,770 --> 01:24:26,560
But when they storm the flat, throw yourself out the window...

693
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:28,610
don't let them get you alive.

694
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:32,030
I have poison on me. They won't get me alive either.

695
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:50,440
Open up!

696
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:57,440
Open the door or we'll call the police!

697
01:28:25,350 --> 01:28:29,430
Are you from this flat? You're not registered.

698
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:32,890
It belongs to a friend of mine. I just came to visit, but I missed him.

699
01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:35,520
Have you got your identity card?

700
01:28:36,150 --> 01:28:39,110
- Let me see your identity card. - Yes, of course.

701
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:44,280
- I want to see your identity card! - What's happening?

702
01:28:44,490 --> 01:28:47,160
He's a Jew! A Jew!

703
01:28:47,370 --> 01:28:49,240
Stop the Jew!

704
01:28:50,250 --> 01:28:52,960
Don't let him out! Stop him!

705
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:10,530
- Yes? - Mr. Gebczynski sent me.

706
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:20,710
- Wladyslaw Szpilman. - Dorota.

707
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,010
Come in.

708
01:30:31,010 --> 01:30:32,600
I'm sorry.

709
01:30:32,810 --> 01:30:36,310
I was given this address and I'm looking for a Mr. Dzikiewicz.

710
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:40,190
Michal Dzikiewicz, he's my husband.

711
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:42,110
Come in.

712
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:52,080
Sit.

713
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:57,410
I need help.

714
01:30:59,210 --> 01:31:02,130
He'll be back before curfew.

715
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:04,920
I've been in hiding.

716
01:31:06,090 --> 01:31:09,630
- I need somewhere to stay. - He'll be here soon.

717
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14,970
- How long have you been married? - Just over a year.

718
01:31:17,770 --> 01:31:20,400
And how is Jurek?

719
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,310
Dead.

720
01:31:28,990 --> 01:31:32,820
- When is your baby due? - Christmas.

721
01:31:33,490 --> 01:31:37,290
This is not a good time to have children, but then...

722
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:43,000
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman.

723
01:31:43,170 --> 01:31:48,010
- Marek Gebczynski sent him. - Yes, I remember.

724
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:52,590
He said to contact you only in case of emergency.

725
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,680
Don't worry now.

726
01:32:03,610 --> 01:32:07,860
We can't move you tonight. You'll sleep on the sofa.

727
01:32:12,530 --> 01:32:14,370
Excuse me.

728
01:32:18,330 --> 01:32:21,370
I'm sorry, could I have a piece of bread?

729
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:24,330
Yes, of course. We will eat.

730
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,630
Sit. Please, sit.

731
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:30,630
Thank you.

732
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:41,850
You're on a very German area.

733
01:34:42,060 --> 01:34:46,480
On the opposite is a hospital taking wounded from the Russian front.

734
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:51,690
And next door is the Schutzpolizei.

735
01:34:53,110 --> 01:34:55,440
Safest place to be.

736
01:34:55,650 --> 01:34:58,570
Right at the heart of the lion's den.

737
01:35:03,660 --> 01:35:05,870
I'll be locking you in.

738
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:10,080
No-one knows you're here, so keep as quiet as possible.

739
01:37:19,670 --> 01:37:21,630
All well?

740
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:24,470
Thank you.

741
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:32,520
This is Antek Szalas. He'll be looking after you.

742
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:34,520
- How do you do? - How do you do?

743
01:37:34,690 --> 01:37:36,520
Thank you.

744
01:37:36,770 --> 01:37:41,730
I've given him a second key. He'll bring food, see that you're alright.

745
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:44,860
He's with the underground, he's a good man.

746
01:37:48,950 --> 01:37:53,160
- You don't remember me? - I don't think so.

747
01:37:53,370 --> 01:37:56,880
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician.

748
01:37:57,460 --> 01:38:00,630
I saw you almost everyday.

749
01:38:01,210 --> 01:38:04,670
- I'm sorry, I don't remember. - It doesn't matter.

750
01:38:06,930 --> 01:38:10,640
You've nothing to worry about. I'll visit often.

751
01:38:11,470 --> 01:38:14,270
You'll be pleased to hear that the Allies are bombing Germany...

752
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:16,480
night after night, after night.

753
01:38:16,690 --> 01:38:19,190
Cologne, Hamburg, Berlin.

754
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:22,730
And the Russians are giving them hell. It's the beginning of the end.

755
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:24,530
Let's hope so.

756
01:38:35,410 --> 01:38:37,620
Come here.

757
01:38:37,790 --> 01:38:40,000
Be careful with it.

758
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:43,880
That's it. Be careful.

759
01:39:10,620 --> 01:39:13,490
Still alive then?

760
01:39:16,830 --> 01:39:21,000
Here. Sausage, bread.

761
01:39:21,210 --> 01:39:23,420
You still got that vodka?

762
01:39:37,770 --> 01:39:41,730
- How long is this meant to last? - Not long now.

763
01:39:42,270 --> 01:39:45,440
I think I've got jaundice.

764
01:39:45,650 --> 01:39:49,490
Don't worry about that. It just makes you look funny.

765
01:39:50,570 --> 01:39:54,620
My grandfather was jilted by his girlfriend when he got jaundice.

766
01:39:54,830 --> 01:39:56,740
Drink up.

767
01:39:57,580 --> 01:40:00,620
Why didn't you come sooner? It's been over two weeks...

768
01:40:00,830 --> 01:40:02,630
Problems.

769
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:04,920
Money.

770
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:07,960
I've got to raise money to buy the food.

771
01:40:08,170 --> 01:40:12,050
I need things to sell, it's not easy.

772
01:40:15,930 --> 01:40:18,600
Here. Sell this.

773
01:40:20,940 --> 01:40:23,150
Food is more important than time.

774
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:31,490
Oh, yes. I meant to tell you! The Allies have landed in France.

775
01:40:31,700 --> 01:40:33,990
Russians will be here soon.

776
01:40:34,450 --> 01:40:37,450
They'll beat the shit out of the Germans...

777
01:40:38,290 --> 01:40:40,330
any day now.

778
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:26,290
Wladek?

779
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:38,640
I knew it. I knew this would happen.

780
01:41:40,890 --> 01:41:43,230
- I'll get a doctor. - You can't. It's too dangerous.

781
01:41:43,430 --> 01:41:47,110
- Dr. Luczak. We can trust him. - Ridiculous. He's a pediatrician.

782
01:41:47,270 --> 01:41:49,730
- He's still a doctor. - No.

783
01:41:49,940 --> 01:41:53,150
You stay. I'll go.

784
01:42:26,270 --> 01:42:29,110
We came to say goodbye.

785
01:42:29,310 --> 01:42:32,320
We're going to stay with my mother in Otwocks.

786
01:42:32,530 --> 01:42:35,860
The baby is already there. It's safer.

787
01:42:36,030 --> 01:42:40,160
There's talk that the uprising will begin any day now.

788
01:42:41,450 --> 01:42:44,450
That man Szalas should be shot.

789
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:49,170
He's been collecting money on your behalf all over Warsaw.

790
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:55,010
Apparently people gave generously, so he collected a tidy sum.

791
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:02,180
My God.

792
01:43:05,350 --> 01:43:10,690
The liver the size of a football. Inflammation of the gall bladder...

793
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:13,820
but he'll leave.

794
01:43:15,860 --> 01:43:20,110
I'll try to get him some laevulose, but it's not easy.

795
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:23,990
- Can you visit him again? - Who knows.

796
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:28,330
- Doctor, thank you. - Don't speak, rest.

797
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:34,460
Thank you so much for coming.

798
01:43:36,090 --> 01:43:38,340
We've brought you some food.

799
01:43:38,550 --> 01:43:42,390
I'll prepare something now for you, then we must go.

800
01:44:23,970 --> 01:44:26,310
I'll throw a grenade!

801
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:37,110
There's a wounded man over there!

802
01:44:37,610 --> 01:44:40,150
Come.

803
01:44:40,280 --> 01:44:42,700
Watch out! Watch out!

804
01:44:43,820 --> 01:44:46,780
- I'll go get help! - Hurry!

805
01:44:47,450 --> 01:44:51,460
Come on! Bring the litter!

806
01:44:55,290 --> 01:44:57,920
Go back inside!

807
01:46:46,990 --> 01:46:49,660
Get out, get out in the streets!

808
01:46:49,870 --> 01:46:53,660
Get out now! The Germans have surrounded the building!

809
01:47:34,740 --> 01:47:39,040
Somebody... Somebody help me!

810
01:48:36,930 --> 01:48:40,100
Are you alright? There's too much dust.

811
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:45,060
I'll check this side. Don't worry.

812
01:48:45,270 --> 01:48:47,730
Be careful!

813
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:55,830
- Heinrich? - I'm checking!

814
01:48:58,370 --> 01:49:00,910
Is there anybody here?

815
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:09,130
- Come on down! - Alright, I'm coming.

816
01:53:17,340 --> 01:53:19,170
Come on, pile them up.

817
01:53:25,510 --> 01:53:27,720
Throw it.

818
01:54:51,970 --> 01:54:54,930
We have to mark everything.

819
01:54:55,980 --> 01:54:56,940
Come on.

820
02:01:58,150 --> 02:02:00,530
What are you doing here?

821
02:02:04,990 --> 02:02:07,330
Who are you?

822
02:02:11,450 --> 02:02:15,040
- Do you understand? - Yes.

823
02:02:17,130 --> 02:02:19,420
What are you doing?

824
02:02:25,180 --> 02:02:27,180
I was...

825
02:02:27,300 --> 02:02:30,390
trying to open this can.

826
02:02:31,060 --> 02:02:33,730
Do you live here?

827
02:02:36,150 --> 02:02:38,110
Do you work here?

828
02:02:38,310 --> 02:02:40,020
No.

829
02:02:43,700 --> 02:02:46,200
What do you do for a living?

830
02:02:49,240 --> 02:02:51,040
I am...

831
02:02:52,660 --> 02:02:55,670
I was a pianist.

832
02:02:57,750 --> 02:03:00,000
Pianist?

833
02:03:18,770 --> 02:03:20,770
Come.

834
02:03:45,720 --> 02:03:47,970
Play something.

835
02:09:07,160 --> 02:09:09,960
Are you hiding here?

836
02:09:14,710 --> 02:09:16,380
Jew?

837
02:09:19,380 --> 02:09:21,800
Where are you hiding yourself?

838
02:09:23,430 --> 02:09:25,430
In the attic.

839
02:09:28,680 --> 02:09:31,020
Show it to me.

840
02:09:54,500 --> 02:09:56,790
Have you got anything to eat?

841
02:10:43,130 --> 02:10:48,720
According to them, it's very important that...

842
02:10:55,440 --> 02:10:57,230
Attention!

843
02:10:58,940 --> 02:11:01,990
- At ease. - At ease.

844
02:12:07,220 --> 02:12:09,220
Jew?

845
02:12:23,650 --> 02:12:25,110
Please.

846
02:12:25,530 --> 02:12:27,570
What does it mean, all that shooting?

847
02:12:28,110 --> 02:12:30,870
The Russians, on the other side of the river.

848
02:12:32,240 --> 02:12:35,700
You just have to hold on a couple of weeks, not more.

849
02:14:07,210 --> 02:14:10,010
- What's going on? - We're leaving.

850
02:14:12,930 --> 02:14:16,260
- Are the Russians here? - Not yet.

851
02:14:19,180 --> 02:14:23,060
I don't know how to thank you.

852
02:14:24,520 --> 02:14:26,730
Thank God, not me.

853
02:14:27,150 --> 02:14:32,780
He wants us to survive. At least, we have to believe in that.

854
02:14:42,620 --> 02:14:45,960
Here. Take it.

855
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:51,300
- And you? - I have another one. Warmer.

856
02:14:55,720 --> 02:14:59,310
What are you going to do when this is over?

857
02:15:01,140 --> 02:15:05,480
I'll play piano again at the Polish radio station.

858
02:15:06,350 --> 02:15:08,150
Tell me your name.

859
02:15:08,360 --> 02:15:11,030
Maybe I'll listen to you playing.

860
02:15:11,190 --> 02:15:13,320
Szpilman.

861
02:15:17,530 --> 02:15:20,410
Perfect name for a pianist.

862
02:16:42,660 --> 02:16:45,330
German! German!

863
02:17:08,480 --> 02:17:11,150

He's Polish.

870
02:17:38,210 --> 02:17:40,470
Yes, he's Polish.

871
02:17:41,720 --> 02:17:44,180
Why the fucking coat?

872
02:17:45,260 --> 02:17:47,520
I'm cold.

873
02:18:06,530 --> 02:18:09,540

You took everything I had. Me, a musician.

02:18:24,590 --> 02:18:28,010
You took my violin, you took my soul.

879
02:18:32,890 --> 02:18:34,560
Musician?

880
02:18:35,770 --> 02:18:37,730
Are you a musician?

881
02:18:38,690 --> 02:18:40,860
Do you know...

882
02:18:41,190 --> 02:18:44,360
a pianist called Szpilman, from the Polish radio station?

883
02:18:44,570 --> 02:18:49,790
- Of course I know him. - I helped him to hide himself.

884
02:18:50,580 --> 02:18:52,710
Tell him I'm here.

885
02:18:53,500 --> 02:18:55,670
Ask him to help me.

886
02:18:58,750 --> 02:19:01,510
- What's your name? - Hosenfeld.

887
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:02,970
What?

888
02:20:45,030 --> 02:20:47,650
It was here, I'm certain of it.

889
02:20:49,660 --> 02:20:51,820
Well, it's not here now.

890
02:20:52,030 --> 02:20:56,160
I shouted, abused them. I'm not proud of it, but that's what I did.

891
02:20:56,410 --> 02:20:57,830
I stood where you are now.

892
02:20:59,040 --> 02:21:02,380
There was a barbed wire and this German came up to me.

893
02:21:03,710 --> 02:21:07,380
- You didn't catch his name? - No.

894
02:21:09,550 --> 02:21:12,850
I'll ask at the factory. They may know something.
