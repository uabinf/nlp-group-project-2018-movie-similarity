1
00:02:40,644 --> 00:02:44,690
Excuse me, can you tell me
this, where Delmare Berry lives?

2
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:47,057
He ain't here.

3
00:02:48,186 --> 00:02:49,515
Go on inside, baby.

4
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:56,558
He's a friend of mine...

5
00:02:57,647 --> 00:03:02,142
Well in fact, he wrote his
address down... right here.

6
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:04,940
Here.

7
00:03:05,149 --> 00:03:07,557
You can see that's Delmare's writing.

8
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:09,685
I sure had a hard
time finding this place!

9
00:03:10,104 --> 00:03:13,311
- That's his writin'.
- Like I said, he's a friend.

10
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,977
My name is John Rambo. We served
on the same team together in Nam.

11
00:03:18,436 --> 00:03:20,434
I don't know if he
ever talked about me...

12
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:25,399
I've got a picture of us together.

13
00:03:26,768 --> 00:03:27,727
Somewhere...

14
00:03:28,606 --> 00:03:30,354
This junk in my pocket!

15
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:33,141
Here... here it is.

16
00:03:33,811 --> 00:03:38,476
That's me, that's Danforth,
Westmore, Bronson, Ortega,

17
00:03:38,975 --> 00:03:40,814
and there's Delmare, right in the back.

18
00:03:40,814 --> 00:03:42,682
We had to put him in the
back because he's so big,

19
00:03:42,732 --> 00:03:44,940
if we didn't, he'd take
up the whole picture!

20
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:46,438
Delmare's gone.

21
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:51,353
- What time will he be back?
- He died.

22
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:52,682
What?

23
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,649
Died last summer.

24
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,936
Died how?

25
00:03:59,605 --> 00:04:02,932
Cancer. Brought it back from Nam.

26
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,438
All that orange stuff
they spread it around.

27
00:04:08,146 --> 00:04:12,522
Cut him down to nothing. I
couldn't lift him off the sheet.

28
00:04:22,392 --> 00:04:23,731
I'm very sorry.

29
00:05:19,894 --> 00:05:21,932
Morning Amy! How are you doing, girls?

30
00:05:21,932 --> 00:05:24,020
- Great, thanks.
- Alright this morning?

31
00:05:27,017 --> 00:05:28,566
- Andy!
- Howdy, Will!

32
00:05:41,273 --> 00:05:43,691
- Good morning, Dave!
- Hi, Sheriff!

33
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,769
Gonna take a bath this week?!

34
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,899
Morning!

35
00:05:59,565 --> 00:06:02,851
You... you visiting someone around here?

36
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,439
No.

37
00:06:07,397 --> 00:06:11,273
You know, wearing that flag on that
jacket, looking the way you do...

38
00:06:12,142 --> 00:06:14,310
you're askin' for
trouble around here, friend!

39
00:06:16,018 --> 00:06:19,565
- Headed North or South?
- North.

40
00:06:20,774 --> 00:06:24,690
Jump in, I'll make sure you
head in the right direction, huh!

41
00:06:36,807 --> 00:06:39,265
- Where you heading?
- Portland.

42
00:06:39,725 --> 00:06:42,352
Portland is South, you said
you were headed North.

43
00:06:43,731 --> 00:06:45,689
You got some place I
can eat around here?

44
00:06:47,896 --> 00:06:50,474
There's a diner about
30 miles up the highway.

45
00:06:53,101 --> 00:06:55,729
Is there a law against me
getting something to eat here?

46
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:57,017
Yeah, me.

47
00:06:59,225 --> 00:07:00,773
Why are you pushin' me?

48
00:07:02,482 --> 00:07:03,890
What did you say?

49
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,267
I said why are you pushing me,
I haven't done anything to you.

50
00:07:07,517 --> 00:07:10,813
First of all, you don't ask the
questions around here, I do. Understand?

51
00:07:11,313 --> 00:07:16,518
Secondly... we don't want
guys like you in this town.

52
00:07:18,316 --> 00:07:19,934
Drifters.

53
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:21,433
First thing you know
we got a whole bunch

54
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:23,940
of guys like you in
this town. That's why!

55
00:07:25,768 --> 00:07:27,437
Besides, you wouldn't like it here...

56
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:31,183
It's a quiet little town.

57
00:07:32,682 --> 00:07:34,230
In fact, you might say it's boring!

58
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,937
But that's the way we like it.

59
00:07:38,686 --> 00:07:40,813
And I get paid to keep it that way.

60
00:07:42,272 --> 00:07:43,271
Boring...

61
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,723
Portland, straight ahead!

62
00:08:03,641 --> 00:08:05,149
If you want some friendly advice...

63
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,354
Get your hair cut and take a bath.
You wouldn't get hassled so much!

64
00:08:10,853 --> 00:08:12,642
Hope this ride helped you out!

65
00:08:19,105 --> 00:08:20,893
Have a nice day, huh!

66
00:08:59,315 --> 00:09:01,223
Where the hell do
you think you're going?

67
00:09:02,811 --> 00:09:04,310
Hey, I'm talkin' to you, goddammit!

68
00:09:09,814 --> 00:09:10,853
Let's see some I.D.!

69
00:09:12,731 --> 00:09:14,230
All right, you're under arrest!

70
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:16,647
You hear me? You put
your hands on the car.

71
00:09:17,107 --> 00:09:19,684
Now you put your hands on
the car, and you spread'em.

72
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,980
Are you gonna put
your hands on that car?

73
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,727
How you do it, you
decide, right now!

74
00:09:40,354 --> 00:09:41,982
Put your legs back.

75
00:09:43,061 --> 00:09:44,060
Back!

76
00:09:46,977 --> 00:09:49,515
You try to be nice to some people!

77
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,768
Well, what do we have here, huh?

78
00:09:59,604 --> 00:10:01,353
What would you be
carrying a knife like this?

79
00:10:02,432 --> 00:10:03,271
Hunting.

80
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:07,437
Don't be a wise guy! What
do you hunt with a knife?

81
00:10:09,395 --> 00:10:10,224
Name it.

82
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,806
- Hi, Will.
- Lester.

83
00:10:18,316 --> 00:10:20,144
Harry, buzz us in, will ya?

84
00:10:20,643 --> 00:10:22,981
Hey, talk about your
sorry looking humanity!

85
00:10:23,481 --> 00:10:25,189
Just another smartass drifter.

86
00:10:28,356 --> 00:10:32,062
- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning, Will. What do you got?

87
00:10:32,522 --> 00:10:34,520
I want you to book
this gentleman for

88
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,605
vagrancy, resisting arrest,
carrying a concealed weapon.

89
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,524
He says he uses it for hunting.

90
00:10:41,562 --> 00:10:43,850
Huntin'? What do you hunt, elephants?

91
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,806
See if you can clean him up a
little. He smells like an animal!

92
00:10:53,351 --> 00:10:55,349
Hey, Mitch... Mitch!

93
00:10:55,768 --> 00:10:56,807
Yo!

94
00:10:56,807 --> 00:10:57,896
Escort this young man downstairs.

95
00:10:58,316 --> 00:10:59,185
Yes, sir.

96
00:11:00,314 --> 00:11:02,022
Right this way, partner.

97
00:11:02,312 --> 00:11:03,141
Right here.

98
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,019
That's it.

99
00:11:11,183 --> 00:11:13,271
OK, here we go.

100
00:11:17,187 --> 00:11:18,685
You know, it looks
like it'll take old Leroy

101
00:11:18,685 --> 00:11:20,683
about 10 years to paint this hall!

102
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:23,101
Why don't you paint it your damned self?

103
00:11:23,231 --> 00:11:25,019
Come on Leroy, sling that paint, boy!

104
00:11:25,648 --> 00:11:26,767
Mr. Ward!

105
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,314
Would you take this for me, please?

106
00:11:38,685 --> 00:11:39,724
Name?

107
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:46,058
Your name?

108
00:11:48,765 --> 00:11:49,814
Your name!

109
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:55,848
Name!

110
00:11:58,765 --> 00:12:01,023
Hey... you're lookin' to trouble?

111
00:12:01,852 --> 00:12:03,560
You came at the right place, buddy!

112
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,189
Oh, wait a second.

113
00:12:07,307 --> 00:12:09,564
You got three seconds
before I break your face in!

114
00:12:10,434 --> 00:12:11,852
He means it.

115
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:13,770
Yeah, I do.

116
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:36,308
What do you know about that?
Old Harry here is a soldier!

117
00:12:37,476 --> 00:12:39,315
Rambo...

118
00:12:39,974 --> 00:12:41,023
John J.?

119
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,558
You're gonna talk to me.

120
00:12:46,937 --> 00:12:49,065
I promise you're gonna
talk to me, soldier.

121
00:12:51,432 --> 00:12:53,480
I'm starting to dislike you.

122
00:12:55,189 --> 00:12:56,358
A lot.

123
00:12:58,356 --> 00:13:00,394
I'm gonna run a make on him.

124
00:13:02,521 --> 00:13:04,769
Put his name in the Teletype.

125
00:13:05,848 --> 00:13:08,226
Just roll it across.

126
00:13:08,685 --> 00:13:10,104
Roll it across!

127
00:13:11,642 --> 00:13:12,941
Push it.

128
00:13:12,941 --> 00:13:15,598
It won't work that way, it'll
only smear. Roll it across!

129
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:18,565
Look, you son of a
bitch, if you don't put your

130
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:20,893
goddamned hand down
there, I'm gonna break it off!

131
00:13:21,353 --> 00:13:25,349
- Put it down, goddammit!
- Art, what the hell's going on down here?

132
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:27,516
Nothing I can't handle.

133
00:13:28,935 --> 00:13:30,274
He won't let us print him well.

134
00:13:31,183 --> 00:13:32,851
Leave the ink on your hand!

135
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:36,727
Just what is your problem, huh?

136
00:13:37,936 --> 00:13:40,104
Listen, hardass! As
things stand right now,

137
00:13:40,104 --> 00:13:42,681
you're facing the ass end
of a 90 day incarceration!

138
00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:46,977
Plus a 250 dollars fine, which you
don't look to me like you can pay!

139
00:13:47,976 --> 00:13:49,894
At 10 o'clock tomorrow morning,
you're going up in front of that judge.

140
00:13:50,723 --> 00:13:51,982
And you think we're tough!

141
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,849
We're gonna make you
look more presentable

142
00:13:54,849 --> 00:13:56,517
for your courtroom appearance.

143
00:13:57,856 --> 00:14:00,104
Between now and then, you can
just impress the hell outta me

144
00:14:00,104 --> 00:14:02,431
by doing exactly as you're told.

145
00:14:08,605 --> 00:14:09,854
Clean him up.

146
00:14:10,813 --> 00:14:12,981
All right, Preston,
I want you to go

147
00:14:12,981 --> 00:14:15,688
over there and get that
hose ready, alright?

148
00:14:19,265 --> 00:14:22,891
Holy shit, look at this!
What the hell's he been into?

149
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,729
Who gives a shit?

150
00:14:25,808 --> 00:14:28,146
All right, put your hands on
top of your head and turn around.

151
00:14:32,641 --> 00:14:36,937
Oh, Christ! We should report this
to Teasle, Gault! Look at that!

152
00:14:37,396 --> 00:14:39,265
You just do what I tell you.

153
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,848
Gault, what the fuck was that?

154
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:48,895
Well, the Man said "clean him up".

155
00:14:52,272 --> 00:14:53,690
Clean him up!

156
00:15:02,641 --> 00:15:08,355
Hey, Preston, don't forget
to get him behind the ears!

157
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,558
How'd you like that, huh?

158
00:15:15,978 --> 00:15:19,524
What's the matter, Mitch?
Don't you like water sports?

159
00:15:27,686 --> 00:15:32,771
All right, hurry it up, it's time for
my coffee break. Alright, sit down!

160
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,979
Sit down!

161
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:45,398
Damn it, that boy's
hard to get a hold of!

162
00:15:46,897 --> 00:15:49,015
That's OK, Ward, don't worry
about the soap, he's tough.

163
00:15:49,354 --> 00:15:51,272
Just shave him. Dry!

164
00:15:51,482 --> 00:15:52,102
All right...

165
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,807
How blind are you? Can't
you see this guy's crazy?

166
00:15:56,807 --> 00:15:59,434
Can't you see I don't give a shit?

167
00:16:00,144 --> 00:16:02,271
- Yeah, I can see that.
- Yeah, that's better.

168
00:16:02,981 --> 00:16:05,099
See there, I knew that you...

169
00:16:06,687 --> 00:16:09,015
We're just going to shave
you partner, take it easy!

170
00:16:09,974 --> 00:16:11,392
Take this, Mitch.

171
00:16:16,227 --> 00:16:17,556
Don't move...

172
00:16:17,896 --> 00:16:19,684
I don't want you to cut your own throat!

173
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:36,307
You son of a bitch! Come on!

174
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:56,687
What the hell is...

175
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:01,892
Art! Art!

176
00:17:18,565 --> 00:17:19,604
Hey, you can't...

177
00:17:47,686 --> 00:17:49,105
I'm gonna kill this asshole!

178
00:17:49,274 --> 00:17:50,353
Art, don't shoot!

179
00:17:51,272 --> 00:17:53,310
Don't shoot, there's people down there!

180
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,478
All right, get help! I'll go after him!

181
00:17:58,895 --> 00:18:00,393
Get outta the way!

182
00:19:40,523 --> 00:19:41,892
Son of a bitch!

183
00:19:50,433 --> 00:19:52,351
Lester, this is Will.
I'm right on his tail.

184
00:19:52,851 --> 00:19:55,188
He's just east of Smith's farm,
headed towards Chapman Creek.

185
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:16,107
I know you can hear me!

186
00:21:18,355 --> 00:21:19,564
You're finished!

187
00:21:21,182 --> 00:21:24,059
You've gone as far as you're gonna go!

188
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:28,265
D'you hear me?

189
00:22:34,099 --> 00:22:34,809
Mitch!

190
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:36,267
Lester!

191
00:22:37,855 --> 00:22:39,604
He's up there behind the draw.

192
00:22:40,523 --> 00:22:42,481
Mitch, get Orval on the radio.

193
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:46,057
Tell him to get out here with
his damned dogs right away.

194
00:22:46,557 --> 00:22:48,105
And tell him to bring the Dobermen!

195
00:22:48,725 --> 00:22:50,523
It's gonna rain, we'll need
dogs that can hunt on sight.

196
00:22:51,352 --> 00:22:53,390
Lester, tell Paul to get
out to the lumber camp

197
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,848
to get the helicopter up here.

198
00:22:55,897 --> 00:22:56,976
If they give him any shit, tell him to

199
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:59,774
site him for obstruction
right on the spot.

200
00:23:02,311 --> 00:23:03,350
We'll get him!

201
00:23:04,229 --> 00:23:06,307
No problem.

202
00:23:38,605 --> 00:23:40,892
Go on, Hooch! Thunder, lets get him!

203
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:43,809
Come on, sweethearts!

204
00:23:44,649 --> 00:23:45,977
Let's go get him, babies!

205
00:23:48,145 --> 00:23:51,102
Won't be long before he's
stuffed and mounted, huh Will?

206
00:23:52,061 --> 00:23:53,020
Make him into a bear rug!

207
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,808
Didn't we go hunting here up last year?

208
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,687
Yeah, I got a couple of bucks last year!

209
00:23:57,815 --> 00:23:59,684
Hey Mitch, up the hill!

210
00:24:20,143 --> 00:24:22,730
Get those hounds away from me,
Orval! I don't trust those bastards!

211
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:27,016
Keep moving, my dogs can
eat and run at the same time!

212
00:24:27,476 --> 00:24:29,104
He's going straight to the top.

213
00:24:30,433 --> 00:24:31,931
Isn't that supposed to be dangerous?

214
00:24:31,931 --> 00:24:33,190
He's just dumb!

215
00:24:49,933 --> 00:24:53,390
Hey, you're spoiling the scent.
Let my babies do their job!

216
00:24:57,476 --> 00:24:59,064
- This is no good.
- Why?

217
00:25:00,063 --> 00:25:02,141
There were three of us in
the cell block down there!

218
00:25:02,351 --> 00:25:04,309
He went through us like
we weren't even there!

219
00:25:05,977 --> 00:25:07,016
Oh, come on!

220
00:26:19,314 --> 00:26:21,811
We've got him, go ahead, he's trapped!

221
00:26:21,891 --> 00:26:24,349
Art, Art! This is Teasle, he's
heading for Chapman's gorge.

222
00:26:24,978 --> 00:26:26,477
Chapman's gorge! Head him off!

223
00:27:01,811 --> 00:27:03,599
There he is! On the cliff!

224
00:27:21,062 --> 00:27:22,481
Son of a bitch!

225
00:27:30,852 --> 00:27:32,101
What the hell's going on?

226
00:27:32,141 --> 00:27:34,558
What are you doing? We're
just supposed to spot him!

227
00:27:35,058 --> 00:27:38,934
- Hold it steady.
- I can't! We're in a thermal draft!

228
00:27:39,434 --> 00:27:42,441
He's stuck there, he can't go any place.

229
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:48,515
If you don't ride this thing right,
I swear to God, I'll kill you!

230
00:27:50,682 --> 00:27:52,311
Sheriff to Galt! Come in Galt.

231
00:27:57,476 --> 00:27:59,104
Hold it steady, you son of a bitch!

232
00:27:59,474 --> 00:28:01,771
Galt, come in, goddamn it!

233
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,058
Get closer and hold it steady!

234
00:28:05,148 --> 00:28:07,515
Galt, talk to me, damn it! I
want to know what's going on!

235
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,809
I got him... easy now.

236
00:28:59,224 --> 00:29:00,273
There he is!

237
00:29:00,273 --> 00:29:02,940
Over there, dummy! Come on!

238
00:29:07,895 --> 00:29:09,274
Hey, soldier boy!

239
00:29:29,773 --> 00:29:33,230
Galt, I'm tellin' you to get on this
radio! What's going on up there?

240
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:38,434
I don't want him dead, Galt,
I want him alive! You hear me?

241
00:29:38,434 --> 00:29:39,473
Art, come in!

242
00:30:39,224 --> 00:30:41,601
Art Galt, come in!
Helicopter, come in, goddamn it!

243
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:43,849
Christ, look!

244
00:30:47,475 --> 00:30:50,522
Jesus Christ, gimme the binoculars!

245
00:30:52,061 --> 00:30:54,518
Oh no, no, no! Shit!

246
00:31:41,351 --> 00:31:43,559
I can't figure it... How did he fall out?

247
00:31:44,898 --> 00:31:45,857
Does it matter?

248
00:31:46,107 --> 00:31:48,774
Let's nail this sucker's
ass... He can't be far!

249
00:31:49,144 --> 00:31:50,063
Will!

250
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,688
Looks like he wants to turn himself in!

251
00:31:56,646 --> 00:32:02,980
There's one man dead. It's not my
fault. I don't want any more hurt.

252
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:05,108
Freeze!

253
00:32:05,148 --> 00:32:07,315
Stay right where you
are and give yourself up!

254
00:32:07,815 --> 00:32:09,683
But I didn't do anything!

255
00:32:10,183 --> 00:32:12,940
I'm warning you, boy, don't make
a move, I'll blow your head off!

256
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,478
I didn't do anything!

257
00:32:20,233 --> 00:32:22,520
Cease fire! Cease fire!

258
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,687
Ward, goddamn it, cease fire!

259
00:32:27,935 --> 00:32:30,432
I think we hit him. Let
us get down there. Move!

260
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,688
Sheriff to base, come in.

261
00:32:38,814 --> 00:32:39,433
Go ahead, Will.

262
00:32:39,893 --> 00:32:41,481
Lester, we're down in the gorge.

263
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,607
Galt's dead, alright? Where the
hell is that goddamned chopper?

264
00:32:46,107 --> 00:32:49,144
He won't come, Will. Says
there's a storm heading your way.

265
00:32:49,643 --> 00:32:51,641
I don't give a goddamned
what's on its way.

266
00:32:51,641 --> 00:32:53,399
I want that chopper back here right now!

267
00:32:53,979 --> 00:32:56,266
I don't want Gault's
body out here all night.

268
00:32:56,266 --> 00:33:00,103
Listen, Will. You sure picked one
hell of a guy to mess around with!

269
00:33:00,183 --> 00:33:01,691
Just came over the
Teletype a few minutes ago.

270
00:33:01,691 --> 00:33:03,190
John Rambo is a Vietnam vet.

271
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:07,815
He's a Green Beret, Congressional
Medal of Honor! Guy's a war hero!

272
00:33:07,975 --> 00:33:09,683
Jesus, that freak?!

273
00:33:09,683 --> 00:33:12,021
I knew there was
something about that guy!

274
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:15,897
I double checked it, Will.
What do you want me to do?

275
00:33:20,562 --> 00:33:22,850
I want you to do what I
told you to do, goddamn it!

276
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:25,357
Get that chopper back here now! Out.

277
00:33:29,104 --> 00:33:30,682
Green Beret!

278
00:33:30,982 --> 00:33:33,269
War hero!

279
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:36,057
- That's great! That's just great!
- Shut your mouth!

280
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,314
What the hell's the
matter with you guys?

281
00:33:38,314 --> 00:33:40,732
He's one man... wounded!

282
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:45,357
Those Green Berets... they're
real bad asses.

283
00:33:45,807 --> 00:33:47,685
Why don't you let the
State Police handle this?

284
00:33:56,726 --> 00:33:58,814
Look. Look at him... look at
him! That's Art Gault, boy!

285
00:33:59,353 --> 00:34:01,731
He and I were friends when your

286
00:34:01,731 --> 00:34:04,099
momma was still wiping your nose!

287
00:34:04,898 --> 00:34:08,184
Now he's dead. He's dead!
Because of that psycho out there!

288
00:34:08,274 --> 00:34:09,563
Now you listen boy,
you listen to me good:

289
00:34:09,683 --> 00:34:11,141
I'm gonna get that son of a bitch...

290
00:34:11,641 --> 00:34:14,558
and I'm gonna pin that Congressional
Medal of Honor to his liver!

291
00:34:15,977 --> 00:34:17,016
And I'm gonna do it,

292
00:34:17,515 --> 00:34:20,142
with you, or without you!

293
00:34:38,524 --> 00:34:40,602
We're closin' in, the
scent's getting stronger.

294
00:34:41,181 --> 00:34:42,690
All right, keep your eyes open!

295
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:49,723
It's gonna storm... it's all we need now!

296
00:34:49,723 --> 00:34:52,350
Will, c'mon, let's get out of
here before it gets too dark.

297
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,268
What's the matter, you
afraid of the boogie man?

298
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:55,647
You goddamned pansy!

299
00:34:58,144 --> 00:35:00,232
Put your gun down, I'll
show you who the pansy is!

300
00:35:02,061 --> 00:35:04,688
Knock it off! Ward! Ward, move out!

301
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:07,315
The fight is out here! He's
out there waiting for you.

302
00:35:08,015 --> 00:35:10,063
Mitch, get on your feet and move!

303
00:35:12,021 --> 00:35:15,187
Go find this guy for Chrissakes!
Keep your eyes open!

304
00:35:15,767 --> 00:35:17,815
- I'll see you later, Ward!
- Shut up, Mitch.

305
00:35:26,686 --> 00:35:27,725
There he is!

306
00:35:29,723 --> 00:35:31,311
Let them dogs loose, Orval!

307
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,188
Go get him sweethearts!
Here's your dinner!

308
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:45,107
Cease fire!

309
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:52,270
Goddammit, I'm hit!

310
00:35:54,808 --> 00:35:57,515
Jesus, he's got a gun..

311
00:36:06,896 --> 00:36:09,223
It's not him, it's a
goddamned scarecrow!

312
00:36:10,182 --> 00:36:12,140
No scarecrow that
shot Orville, he's close.

313
00:36:14,728 --> 00:36:15,767
Kill him! Go get him!

314
00:36:16,936 --> 00:36:19,023
Go get him, Maggie!

315
00:36:31,771 --> 00:36:35,647
Mitch, Ward, come here!
Shingleton, you cover us.

316
00:36:36,306 --> 00:36:38,394
Look at his leg!

317
00:36:38,394 --> 00:36:40,062
Mitch, get your belt. Make
a tourniquet around that.

318
00:36:40,562 --> 00:36:42,060
We got to get this guy to a doctor!

319
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:44,518
Goddamnit, get your belt on that
fast! Where's the first-aid kit?

320
00:36:44,558 --> 00:36:45,557
I left it in the car.

321
00:36:45,977 --> 00:36:46,606
Shit!

322
00:36:46,816 --> 00:36:49,393
- Where did he get that gun?
- It's gotta be Art Gault's gun.

323
00:36:49,563 --> 00:36:51,521
- He's outta ammo...
- How do you know that?

324
00:36:51,771 --> 00:36:54,398
Because whatever killed Orval's
dog was no bullet, that's how!

325
00:36:55,147 --> 00:36:57,225
Hurry up! Orval, listen
to me, now listen!

326
00:36:57,685 --> 00:36:59,103
You have to stay awake, all right?

327
00:36:59,393 --> 00:37:01,481
You have to release that
tourniquet every 15 minutes.

328
00:37:01,481 --> 00:37:04,478
We'll be right back! We go
get him now, he's outta ammo.

329
00:37:05,477 --> 00:37:08,564
Get him! He had no right to shoot
my babies. Get the son of a bitch!

330
00:37:08,724 --> 00:37:10,102
- Let's go!
- Go get him!

331
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,728
All right, now listen up!

332
00:37:15,397 --> 00:37:16,436
We're right on top of him.

333
00:37:16,436 --> 00:37:18,524
We're gonna form a
skirmish line, 50 feet apart.

334
00:37:18,684 --> 00:37:20,981
Keep moving, there's no way
outta here, except through us.

335
00:37:24,938 --> 00:37:27,015
OK, let's do some huntin'...

336
00:37:27,685 --> 00:37:30,682
Huntin'? We ain't
huntin' him, he's huntin' us!

337
00:37:45,857 --> 00:37:48,604
Spread out. Spread out,
dammit! I said 50 feet!

338
00:38:13,938 --> 00:38:14,977
I hate this!

339
00:39:29,023 --> 00:39:30,062
Will, it's Mitch!

340
00:39:37,605 --> 00:39:38,524
Who is it?

341
00:40:08,394 --> 00:40:09,812
- What's goin' on?
- Shut up!

342
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:15,976
He's got Ward. Spread
out, I'll go this way.

343
00:40:25,976 --> 00:40:27,015
Will! Over here!

344
00:40:31,601 --> 00:40:32,600
Who's firing?

345
00:40:34,308 --> 00:40:35,357
Who's firing?

346
00:40:35,557 --> 00:40:36,686
I got him!

347
00:40:37,475 --> 00:40:38,813
Shingleton, follow me!

348
00:40:44,348 --> 00:40:45,766
Will, help me!

349
00:40:47,065 --> 00:40:48,104
Help me, Will!

350
00:40:54,268 --> 00:40:55,856
Balford? Where the hell are you?!

351
00:41:08,104 --> 00:41:08,973
Shingleton, over here!

352
00:41:26,186 --> 00:41:27,645
Shingleton, where the hell are you?!

353
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:55,187
I could have killed'em all.
I could have killed you.

354
00:41:56,396 --> 00:41:58,604
In town you're the law,
out here, it's me!

355
00:41:59,732 --> 00:42:04,308
Don't push it! Don't push it, or I'll
give you a war you won't believe!

356
00:42:07,565 --> 00:42:08,604
Let it go.

357
00:42:10,771 --> 00:42:11,810
Let it go.

358
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,648
Move back, you guys, move back!

359
00:43:16,266 --> 00:43:18,773
How bad is the situation?
Captain, we need some...

360
00:43:19,732 --> 00:43:21,271
That's the only good thing about this,

361
00:43:21,271 --> 00:43:22,849
is the business you're doing in town!

362
00:43:23,648 --> 00:43:25,766
Reporters are drinking the place dry.

363
00:43:28,184 --> 00:43:30,352
You look like you're
ready to keel over, Will.

364
00:43:31,061 --> 00:43:33,399
Why don't you go
home? It's my problem now.

365
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:36,016
Your problem? Listen Dave,
don't give me any of your

366
00:43:36,016 --> 00:43:38,813
horsehit about jurisdiction
in this one, you understand?

367
00:43:39,523 --> 00:43:42,140
- Should I step outside?
- Just finish up what you're doing.

368
00:43:43,688 --> 00:43:47,105
Somewhere in this rugged mountain
countryside, possibly above the snow line,

369
00:43:48,274 --> 00:43:51,351
shrouded in mist, the
fugitive John Rambo, is hiding.

370
00:43:51,441 --> 00:43:52,769
Units of the state
police along with local

371
00:43:52,769 --> 00:43:56,815
members of the National
Guard are now being mobilized.

372
00:43:57,435 --> 00:43:59,892
What still remains
unexplained by local authorities

373
00:43:59,892 --> 00:44:01,810
is just how and where
the former Green Beret

374
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:03,519
came into possession of the weapons

375
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:06,436
with which he allegedly
killed one deputy sheriff,

376
00:44:06,855 --> 00:44:08,144
and tried to kill 6 others.

377
00:44:08,524 --> 00:44:10,392
Only their skilled training
in police enforcement

378
00:44:10,392 --> 00:44:12,270
techniques saved their lives.

379
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:14,268
And word now is that
the fugitive will be

380
00:44:14,268 --> 00:44:16,396
in custody in a matter of hours.

381
00:44:18,474 --> 00:44:19,682
Maps, Will.

382
00:44:21,141 --> 00:44:23,558
Will, there's something
I think you oughta know.

383
00:44:24,647 --> 00:44:26,016
I'll talk to you later, OK?

384
00:44:26,476 --> 00:44:28,643
What is it, Lester? What is it
for Christ sake, spit it out!

385
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,057
Well, I was just talkin' to
Mitch, and he was sayin' that

386
00:44:35,057 --> 00:44:38,973
Gault and a couple of deputies
were... a little hard on the guy.

387
00:44:39,522 --> 00:44:40,561
Assholes!

388
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:45,017
It doesn't make one goddammed bit
of difference, Dave, and you know it!

389
00:44:47,315 --> 00:44:51,141
If one of my deputies... gets
outta line with a prisoner,

390
00:44:51,141 --> 00:44:52,519
then the prisoner
comes to me with it!

391
00:44:53,229 --> 00:44:55,516
And if I find out it's like he
says, I kick the deputy's ass!

392
00:44:55,606 --> 00:44:58,024
Me, the law! That's
the way it's gotta be.

393
00:44:59,982 --> 00:45:03,269
People start fuckin' around with
the law, and all hell breaks loose.

394
00:45:06,685 --> 00:45:08,394
Whatever possessed God in
heaven to make a man like Rambo?

395
00:45:09,183 --> 00:45:10,481
God didn't make Rambo.

396
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,099
I made him.

397
00:45:13,648 --> 00:45:14,687
Who the hell are you?

398
00:45:15,267 --> 00:45:18,104
Sam Trautman. Colonel Samuel Trautman.

399
00:45:19,143 --> 00:45:21,640
We're a little busy this morning,
Colonel, what can I do for ya?

400
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,558
- I've come to get my boy.
- Your boy?

401
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:28,144
I recruited him, I trained him, I
commanded him in Vietnam for 3 years.

402
00:45:29,353 --> 00:45:30,392
I'd say that makes him mine.

403
00:45:30,681 --> 00:45:32,939
I wonder why the Pentagon would

404
00:45:32,939 --> 00:45:36,016
send a full bird Colonel to handle this?

405
00:45:36,855 --> 00:45:38,973
The army thought I
might be able to help.

406
00:45:39,063 --> 00:45:40,811
I don't know in what way.

407
00:45:40,811 --> 00:45:42,599
Rambo's a civilian now, he's my problem.

408
00:45:44,148 --> 00:45:48,224
I don't think you understand. I didn't
come here to rescue Rambo from you.

409
00:45:48,434 --> 00:45:50,521
I came here to rescue you from him.

410
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:54,228
Well, we all appreciate
your concern, Colonel.

411
00:45:54,977 --> 00:45:56,515
We'll try to be extra careful!

412
00:45:57,774 --> 00:46:00,142
I'm just amazed he allowed
any of your posse to live.

413
00:46:00,981 --> 00:46:01,940
Is that right?

414
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:05,766
Strictly speaking, he slipped up.
You're lucky to be breathing!

415
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:06,815
That's just great!

416
00:46:08,473 --> 00:46:09,233
Colonel, you came out here

417
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:11,940
to find out why one of
your machines blew a gasket!

418
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:14,557
You don't seem to want to
accept the fact that you're

419
00:46:14,557 --> 00:46:17,185
dealing with an expert
in guerilla warfare.

420
00:46:17,854 --> 00:46:19,233
With a man who's the best.

421
00:46:19,642 --> 00:46:21,940
With guns, with knives,
with his bare hands.

422
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:26,475
A man who's been trained to
ignore pain, ignore weather.

423
00:46:27,355 --> 00:46:29,353
To live off the land...

424
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:31,730
To eat things that would
make a billy goat puke.

425
00:46:32,729 --> 00:46:37,015
In Vietnam, his job was to dispose
of enemy personnel, to kill... period!

426
00:46:37,934 --> 00:46:41,980
Win by attrition. Well,
Rambo was the best!

427
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:40,431
OK, Colonel, now you've
got us all scared to death.

428
00:47:40,431 --> 00:47:42,809
What do you and the Special Forces think

429
00:47:42,939 --> 00:47:45,187
I oughta do about your psycho out there?

430
00:47:47,065 --> 00:47:48,064
Let him go.

431
00:47:48,144 --> 00:47:49,812
- Do what?
- For now.

432
00:47:51,231 --> 00:47:53,229
Defuse the whole situation, defuse him.

433
00:47:54,058 --> 00:47:56,355
Provide a little gap and
let him slip through it.

434
00:47:56,855 --> 00:47:59,732
Then put out a nation wide
APB. In a couple of weeks,

435
00:47:59,732 --> 00:48:02,519
you'll pick him up in Seattle or
someplace, working in a car wash.

436
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,018
There'll be no fight and
nobody else will get hurt.

437
00:48:04,018 --> 00:48:06,605
I do my own work. I don't
figure the best way to do that is

438
00:48:06,605 --> 00:48:09,312
to close my eyes and then hope
he gets picked up in Seattle!

439
00:48:10,102 --> 00:48:12,230
If you send your people in
there after him, they'll get killed!

440
00:48:12,309 --> 00:48:14,937
You know, we're just a small
hick town Sheriff's department,

441
00:48:14,937 --> 00:48:17,015
Colonel, but we're
expected to do our duty

442
00:48:17,065 --> 00:48:19,143
just like our heroes
in the Special Forces.

443
00:48:19,392 --> 00:48:22,599
In Special Forces, we teach our
people to stay alive in the line of duty.

444
00:48:23,149 --> 00:48:24,607
No shit, I never thought of that!

445
00:48:24,607 --> 00:48:25,686
You want a war you can't win?

446
00:48:25,766 --> 00:48:29,982
Are you tellin' me that 200 men against
your boy is a no win situation for us?

447
00:48:30,272 --> 00:48:31,980
You send that many,
don't forget one thing.

448
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:32,979
What?

449
00:48:33,308 --> 00:48:34,977
A good supply of body-bags!

450
00:48:38,563 --> 00:48:39,682
Trautman!

451
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:44,307
I don't know which side
you're on, Trautman...

452
00:48:44,937 --> 00:48:47,394
I still think you came out
here just to cover your ass.

453
00:48:47,774 --> 00:48:51,890
But if you're serious about taking
Rambo out clean, follow me...

454
00:49:13,189 --> 00:49:16,395
State police calling John
Rambo. Acknowledge.

455
00:49:22,769 --> 00:49:27,774
State police calling John Rambo.
Come in please. Acknowledge!

456
00:49:29,602 --> 00:49:33,398
If you're listening, Rambo, here's
your situation: you are surrounded.

457
00:49:33,438 --> 00:49:36,186
Every possible exit has been blocked,

458
00:49:36,186 --> 00:49:38,773
every highway, every
road, every fire break.

459
00:49:38,983 --> 00:49:40,691
You have our word that
your services to your

460
00:49:40,691 --> 00:49:42,439
country will be taken
into consideration.

461
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:44,188
And you'll receive fair treatment.

462
00:49:44,477 --> 00:49:47,564
Just respond, we can
work everything out... over.

463
00:49:48,393 --> 00:49:49,183
Anything?

464
00:49:49,812 --> 00:49:53,438
- He took a radio off one of my deputies.
- Then he has to be listening.

465
00:49:54,058 --> 00:49:55,436
If I was in his position,
I'd try to pick up

466
00:49:55,436 --> 00:49:57,814
some information. Maybe
catch some cross talk.

467
00:49:58,353 --> 00:49:59,183
Of course, he's listening.

468
00:49:59,432 --> 00:50:00,891
He's not gonna break radio silence.

469
00:50:00,891 --> 00:50:04,018
No, not for us, but he
might do it for you, Colonel.

470
00:50:04,687 --> 00:50:06,225
He's your boy, isn't he?

471
00:50:09,103 --> 00:50:12,729
Maybe you can talk him into sparing
all our lives by giving himself up.

472
00:50:13,648 --> 00:50:14,727
I can try.

473
00:50:15,306 --> 00:50:17,684
At least, we'd get a
radio fix on his position,

474
00:50:17,684 --> 00:50:19,143
if you don't mind
setting him up for us...

475
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,601
Setting him up for you?

476
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:23,188
It's like bringing the
pigeons to the cat!

477
00:50:29,143 --> 00:50:30,731
Thanks for bringing your people out.

478
00:50:30,811 --> 00:50:31,690
Any time, Will.

479
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:33,898
C'mon, Bobby, put the
magazine away, will ya?

480
00:50:33,898 --> 00:50:36,565
Pay attention. I mean we
may only get one crack at this.

481
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:44,727
Company leader calling
Raven. Come on Raven.

482
00:50:47,564 --> 00:50:49,063
Company leader calling Raven.

483
00:50:53,598 --> 00:50:56,725
Company leader to
Raven. Talk to me, Johnny.

484
00:50:58,983 --> 00:51:01,230
Company leader to identify Baker Team:

485
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:06,685
Rambo, Messner, Ortega, Coletta,

486
00:51:06,815 --> 00:51:11,440
Jorgensen, Danforth, Berry, Krakauer.

487
00:51:12,139 --> 00:51:12,979
Confirm.

488
00:51:13,898 --> 00:51:15,146
This is Colonel Trautman.

489
00:51:17,434 --> 00:51:18,683
Talk to me, Johnny.

490
00:51:33,808 --> 00:51:35,476
They're all gone, Sir.

491
00:51:35,976 --> 00:51:39,732
- That's him, get on it.
- Rambo. Are you alright? Over.

492
00:51:39,772 --> 00:51:41,560
Baker team, they're all dead, Sir.

493
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:45,646
Not Delmare Berry, he made it.

494
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:47,724
Berry's gone too, Sir.

495
00:51:49,182 --> 00:51:50,101
How?

496
00:51:50,811 --> 00:51:52,519
Got himself killed in Nam...

497
00:51:52,649 --> 00:51:56,016
Didn't even know it. Cancer
ate him down to the bone.

498
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:59,142
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

499
00:52:00,391 --> 00:52:02,020
I'm the last one, Sir.

500
00:52:02,899 --> 00:52:05,936
It's good to hear your voice,
Johnny. It's been a long time!

501
00:52:07,894 --> 00:52:10,431
Look, John, you've
done some damage here,

502
00:52:10,431 --> 00:52:11,440
but they don't want any more trouble.

503
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,899
He's north-west!

504
00:52:13,438 --> 00:52:15,017
That's why I've come.

505
00:52:16,265 --> 00:52:17,934
I'm gonna come in
and fly you the hell out.

506
00:52:17,974 --> 00:52:21,890
Just you and me. We'll work this
out together. Is that fair enough?

507
00:52:22,899 --> 00:52:24,187
Where'd you come from, Sir?

508
00:52:24,607 --> 00:52:25,646
Bragg.

509
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:28,563
I tried to get in touch with you,

510
00:52:28,563 --> 00:52:30,771
but the guys at Bragg
never knew where to find you.

511
00:52:30,851 --> 00:52:33,148
Well, I haven't been spending
much time there lately,

512
00:52:33,148 --> 00:52:36,265
they've got me down in DC.
I'm shining a seat with my ass.

513
00:52:36,895 --> 00:52:38,723
I wish I was back in Bragg now.

514
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:43,558
We'll talk about that when you come in.

515
00:52:43,558 --> 00:52:45,226
I can't do that, Sir.

516
00:52:48,313 --> 00:52:50,601
Well, look, John, we can't have
you running around out there,

517
00:52:50,691 --> 00:52:52,059
wasting friendly civilians.

518
00:52:52,689 --> 00:52:55,646
- There are no friendly civilians.
- I'm your friend, Johnny.

519
00:52:56,725 --> 00:52:59,062
I was there with you, knee
deep in blood and guts.

520
00:53:00,101 --> 00:53:01,890
I covered your ass more than once!

521
00:53:04,897 --> 00:53:06,225
Seems like bailing you out of trouble

522
00:53:06,225 --> 00:53:07,894
is becoming a lifetime job for me!

523
00:53:08,063 --> 00:53:10,731
There wouldn't be no trouble
except for that king shit cop!

524
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:13,188
All I wanted was something to eat.

525
00:53:14,727 --> 00:53:16,435
But the man kept pushin', Sir.

526
00:53:17,474 --> 00:53:19,312
Well, you did some
pushin' on your own, John!

527
00:53:20,391 --> 00:53:21,940
They drew first blood, not me.

528
00:53:22,019 --> 00:53:22,979
Look Johnny...

529
00:53:24,227 --> 00:53:26,105
Let me come in, and get
you the hell outta there.

530
00:53:28,223 --> 00:53:30,271
They drew first blood...

531
00:53:37,973 --> 00:53:40,851
Rambo! Are you still reading me?

532
00:53:45,646 --> 00:53:47,314
Company leader to Raven!

533
00:53:48,643 --> 00:53:49,892
Rambo, acknowledge!

534
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:52,978
He's all finished, Colonel!

535
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:55,975
We've got a real good fix on him now.

536
00:53:56,395 --> 00:53:58,893
Come first light, I'm gonna put
every man I got upon that ridge.

537
00:53:59,732 --> 00:54:01,350
Then we'll get him my way!

538
00:54:07,144 --> 00:54:08,813
Goddammit.

539
00:54:10,481 --> 00:54:11,350
Goddammit!

540
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,398
Come on, move it!

541
00:54:25,266 --> 00:54:26,105
Let's go!

542
00:54:28,143 --> 00:54:29,852
Does this guy got a gun?

543
00:55:40,731 --> 00:55:41,979
There's the guy the
cops are shootin' at!

544
00:55:41,979 --> 00:55:44,976
I see him over there,
I'll get him, I'll get him!

545
00:55:45,476 --> 00:55:46,685
Don't shoot!

546
00:55:47,933 --> 00:55:49,022
This way! Let's go!

547
00:55:55,816 --> 00:55:57,394
There he is! Come on!

548
00:56:14,727 --> 00:56:16,475
Now we got him!

549
00:56:20,441 --> 00:56:23,188
Yes, I know exactly where it is.
Now listen to me very carefully.

550
00:56:23,728 --> 00:56:25,855
Surround the area with every
man you've got, but don't move in.

551
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:27,224
I repeat: don't move in!

552
00:56:27,224 --> 00:56:30,141
Don't do anything till I get
there! And no shooting!

553
00:56:30,351 --> 00:56:31,939
I don't want him dead, I want him alive!

554
00:56:49,851 --> 00:56:51,600
Keep firing!

555
00:56:53,648 --> 00:56:55,566
Come on guys, shoot!

556
00:56:57,434 --> 00:56:58,683
Come on!

557
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:02,229
You guys are great!

558
00:57:03,348 --> 00:57:04,477
- All right, Steve.
- Yo!

559
00:57:05,016 --> 00:57:06,265
I want you and Bruce,
head around these trees,

560
00:57:06,265 --> 00:57:07,394
go to the front of that mine.

561
00:57:07,434 --> 00:57:09,432
Screw that Clint, but
I ain't goin' up there!

562
00:57:09,432 --> 00:57:10,351
No way!

563
00:57:15,146 --> 00:57:16,315
- Brandon?
- What?

564
00:57:17,274 --> 00:57:19,981
- I want you to go into that mine.
- No, not me!

565
00:57:19,981 --> 00:57:20,940
What do you mean, not me?!

566
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:23,648
Look, I do this part time, I
didn't come here to get killed.

567
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,565
He's probably just waitin' for us!

568
00:57:26,605 --> 00:57:27,973
What's wrong with you, Clinton?

569
00:57:32,599 --> 00:57:36,515
Rambo! This is
Lieutenant Clinton Morgan.

570
00:57:37,314 --> 00:57:38,982
National Guard leader.

571
00:57:40,481 --> 00:57:44,896
And I'm giving you just
3.0 seconds to come on out.

572
00:57:46,974 --> 00:57:48,932
Who's got the rocket launcher?

573
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:50,890
- I do.
- Come here, Earl.

574
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:51,809
Right!

575
00:57:52,848 --> 00:57:56,395
Rambo! This is your
last chance to come out.

576
00:57:57,524 --> 00:57:59,312
Maybe we should wait.

577
00:57:59,771 --> 00:58:02,229
Earl, this creep is a killer!

578
00:58:02,229 --> 00:58:04,896
Besides, I'm in charge
and I say we blow it up!

579
00:58:05,146 --> 00:58:08,852
Now fire that thing! Just let
me get outta the way first.

580
00:58:34,557 --> 00:58:35,765
Give that man a cigar!

581
00:58:36,515 --> 00:58:37,773
Bull's eye!

582
00:59:17,853 --> 00:59:20,940
- Where the hell are they?
- Up the hill about 500 yards.

583
00:59:24,357 --> 00:59:25,975
Move in a little closer,
just like Iwa Jima.

584
00:59:28,642 --> 00:59:31,140
I don't believe it! Idiots!

585
00:59:32,059 --> 00:59:34,437
All right, one more for
"Soldier of Fortune"!

586
00:59:34,517 --> 00:59:35,566
Soldier of Fortune?!

587
00:59:36,065 --> 00:59:39,142
Dammit, what the hell do you
think this is, some kind of a circus?

588
00:59:39,272 --> 00:59:40,601
Get the hell outta here!

589
00:59:42,808 --> 00:59:43,558
Clinton, Jesus!

590
00:59:44,646 --> 00:59:46,065
Didn't you get the word, Clinton?

591
00:59:46,065 --> 00:59:48,023
I told you people to
wait until I got up here!

592
00:59:48,063 --> 00:59:49,432
Well, he was shooting at us, Will!

593
00:59:49,432 --> 00:59:51,729
Come on! I wasn't taking any chances.

594
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:55,356
What a mess!

595
00:59:57,643 --> 01:00:00,101
We have to dig his body
out of there right away.

596
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:02,938
You can't get a dozer up here,

597
01:00:02,938 --> 01:00:04,806
you're gonna have to find
somebody to dig him out!

598
01:00:05,186 --> 01:00:06,814
It's your mess, Clinton!
You clean it up.

599
01:00:07,224 --> 01:00:09,851
Will, come on... I gotta be back
at the drug store tomorrow!

600
01:00:09,891 --> 01:00:12,399
You'd better get started
right away, Clinton!

601
01:00:15,516 --> 01:00:16,565
Shit!

602
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:04,147
Buried in a hole by a bunch of
goddamned weekend warriors!

603
01:01:05,645 --> 01:01:07,224
Thought you said he was
the best you ever trained!

604
01:01:08,183 --> 01:01:09,521
However he may have ended up,

605
01:01:09,521 --> 01:01:11,350
there was a time when
he was very special.

606
01:01:11,689 --> 01:01:14,726
'Special', my ass! He was just
another drifter that broke the law.

607
01:01:14,806 --> 01:01:16,265
Vagrancy, wasn't it?

608
01:01:16,724 --> 01:01:19,601
That's gonna look real good on
his gravestone in Arlington:

609
01:01:20,351 --> 01:01:23,727
"Here lies John Rambo, winner of
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

610
01:01:24,227 --> 01:01:27,184
Survivor of countless
incursions behind enemy lines.

611
01:01:28,353 --> 01:01:30,810
Killed for vagrancy,
in 'Jerkwater', USA.

612
01:01:31,649 --> 01:01:33,557
Don't give me any of
that crap, Trautman!

613
01:01:34,516 --> 01:01:37,773
You think Rambo was the only guy
who had a tough time in Vietnam?

614
01:01:37,933 --> 01:01:40,560
He killed a police
officer, for Christ sake!

615
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,439
You're goddamned lucky
he didn't kill all of you...

616
01:01:59,731 --> 01:02:02,149
This character! He
comes waltzing in here,

617
01:02:02,149 --> 01:02:03,727
full of all kinds of good advice.

618
01:02:03,937 --> 01:02:06,774
And wished we'd let that
goddamned maniac go on the loose,

619
01:02:06,774 --> 01:02:08,023
so we could save our own asses!

620
01:02:08,143 --> 01:02:11,390
Well, we saved our asses, Colonel!
And we didn't let him go on the loose.

621
01:02:11,939 --> 01:02:16,225
The best man lost!
And he doesn't like it!

622
01:03:49,272 --> 01:03:51,939
- How you doin', Will?
- Hold my calls.

623
01:06:12,598 --> 01:06:13,647
Colonel?

624
01:06:18,232 --> 01:06:19,142
Have a seat.

625
01:06:25,355 --> 01:06:27,893
Oh miss, can you do this again, please?

626
01:06:27,893 --> 01:06:30,390
- Oh sure!
- And for my friend...?

627
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:33,397
A shot of wild turkey.

628
01:06:35,106 --> 01:06:39,941
If I was out of line before,
I just want to apologize.

629
01:06:42,099 --> 01:06:44,266
None of that makes much
difference now, does it?

630
01:06:46,184 --> 01:06:47,563
No, I guess not.

631
01:06:49,811 --> 01:06:52,099
I suppose...

632
01:06:53,148 --> 01:06:54,646
I just feel...

633
01:06:57,024 --> 01:07:00,600
Like you were... cheated
outta your chance?

634
01:07:01,189 --> 01:07:02,978
I wanted to kill that kid.

635
01:07:04,356 --> 01:07:06,724
I wanted to kill him so
bad, I could taste it.

636
01:07:08,272 --> 01:07:10,350
Doesn't sit well with that badge.

637
01:07:11,689 --> 01:07:14,017
It can get confusing sometimes...

638
01:07:16,394 --> 01:07:18,312
In Vietnam, you can bet that Rambo and

639
01:07:18,312 --> 01:07:22,348
I got pretty confused. But we had orders.

640
01:07:23,477 --> 01:07:25,895
When in doubt... kill!

641
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:31,689
But what the hell, you're a civilian.

642
01:07:31,689 --> 01:07:34,436
You can go home to your wife,

643
01:07:34,436 --> 01:07:36,065
and your house and
your little flower garden.

644
01:07:36,524 --> 01:07:38,432
You're under no pressure
to figure all this out.

645
01:07:38,562 --> 01:07:39,431
And what about you, Colonel?

646
01:07:39,431 --> 01:07:40,980
What did you figure
out from all of this, huh?

647
01:07:42,019 --> 01:07:44,186
I mean what would you have
done with him if he came in?

648
01:07:44,516 --> 01:07:46,934
Would you wrap your arms
around him to give a big sloppy kiss?

649
01:07:47,433 --> 01:07:49,351
Or would you have blown his brains out?

650
01:07:58,103 --> 01:08:00,890
I couldn't answer that
until I met him face to face.

651
01:08:04,266 --> 01:08:06,015
Well, there it is.

652
01:08:07,643 --> 01:08:11,229
Just as well we never
got a chance to find out.

653
01:10:02,228 --> 01:10:03,357
Drive!

654
01:10:06,014 --> 01:10:09,941
Don't look at me, look at the road.
That's how accidents happen!

655
01:10:11,019 --> 01:10:14,106
- What's your name?
- Cathcart, Robert A.

656
01:10:14,566 --> 01:10:16,394
All right, what do you
got in the back, Robert A.?

657
01:10:16,973 --> 01:10:18,482
M60.

658
01:10:21,849 --> 01:10:24,896
- OK, Robert A., get out of the truck.
- I don't got no beef with you!

659
01:10:26,144 --> 01:10:27,143
Go home! Move, go home!

660
01:10:52,228 --> 01:10:54,686
Want to turn that up?

661
01:10:58,142 --> 01:11:00,350
What's your story, Steamboat?

662
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:03,187
Looks like somebody
pulled the plug too soon...

663
01:11:03,397 --> 01:11:06,144
That Rambo guy? He's on the loose again!

664
01:11:06,144 --> 01:11:07,183
Shit!

665
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:13,727
Hey Will, it's Rambo! He's still around!

666
01:14:55,395 --> 01:14:58,931
- Holy fuck!
- Get out there right away. Move!

667
01:15:24,146 --> 01:15:26,024
What the hell is going on?!

668
01:15:29,141 --> 01:15:31,728
- Watch yourselves!
- They're all gonna blow!

669
01:15:41,898 --> 01:15:44,186
Attention, all civilians!

670
01:15:45,065 --> 01:15:49,141
For your own safety, please
evacuate the streets immediately.

671
01:15:50,270 --> 01:15:53,726
Remain indoors until you
receive further instructions.

672
01:15:53,766 --> 01:15:56,564
I repeat: this is a police emergency.

673
01:15:56,564 --> 01:15:59,311
Please evacuate the streets immediately.

674
01:16:17,892 --> 01:16:19,850
They found Rambo's body...

675
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,517
As a matter of fact,
he stole an army truck

676
01:16:23,517 --> 01:16:25,974
and blew up a gas station
on the other side of town.

677
01:16:26,723 --> 01:16:28,182
The kid is resilient.

678
01:16:29,441 --> 01:16:31,848
Why don't you forget what you're
thinking and clear out while you can?

679
01:16:32,607 --> 01:16:34,895
Get the fuck outta here, Trautman!
You take your advice with you.

680
01:16:35,974 --> 01:16:37,682
When I talked to you
earlier this afternoon,

681
01:16:37,682 --> 01:16:40,350
you knew he was still alive, didn't you?

682
01:16:41,728 --> 01:16:43,227
I suspected it.

683
01:16:43,557 --> 01:16:48,522
Sure... Sure, that's why you
stuck around. You trained him.

684
01:16:48,811 --> 01:16:51,269
You taught him how to get
out of places like that cave.

685
01:16:52,228 --> 01:16:54,146
But he's not gonna
get out of this place!

686
01:16:54,566 --> 01:16:57,063
Teasle, you and all your men
couldn't handle him before,

687
01:16:57,063 --> 01:16:58,891
what makes you think
you can handle him now?

688
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:02,018
Because God knows what
damage he's prepared to do.

689
01:17:14,066 --> 01:17:15,564
You're gonna die, Teasle.

690
01:17:16,224 --> 01:17:17,892
Everybody dies!

691
01:17:18,981 --> 01:17:21,349
There's only one man in this
room that has half a chance.

692
01:17:21,349 --> 01:17:23,267
That's not because
I'm better than he is.

693
01:17:23,726 --> 01:17:25,265
But it's because he trusts me.

694
01:17:25,684 --> 01:17:27,732
See, I'm the closest thing
to family that he has left,

695
01:17:27,852 --> 01:17:30,190
and that may be all the edge I need.

696
01:17:30,649 --> 01:17:32,897
Jesus Christ, where do
you people come from?

697
01:17:38,102 --> 01:17:40,899
This is my job Trautman,
this is my town!

698
01:17:41,269 --> 01:17:44,765
And I'm not giving it up to you,
or to Rambo or anybody else!

699
01:17:45,355 --> 01:17:48,641
Now you just stay the hell outta my way!

700
01:17:57,892 --> 01:18:00,020
- Get a little closer!
- I can't!

701
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:01,479
It's too goddamned hot!

702
01:18:03,397 --> 01:18:05,225
Will, it's Lester, do you copy, over?

703
01:18:07,313 --> 01:18:10,480
Come on, let's go! Will, this
is Lester, do you copy, over?

704
01:18:11,688 --> 01:18:16,683
Listen Will, we've got some serious
problems. The highway's been cut off.

705
01:18:16,723 --> 01:18:19,980
The truck's out here, but
we couldn't find the body.

706
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:21,978
I repeat: no body,
it's totally burnt out.

707
01:18:21,978 --> 01:18:23,936
Preston, get those people outta here!

708
01:18:25,145 --> 01:18:26,973
Move them back to the south side.

709
01:18:28,681 --> 01:18:33,516
We don't know how many gas
tanks there are under the pumps...

710
01:24:24,815 --> 01:24:27,772
Go ahead... go ahead!

711
01:24:28,521 --> 01:24:30,559
Go ahead, you crazy
son of a bitch, finish me!

712
01:24:30,649 --> 01:24:31,688
Rambo!

713
01:24:32,687 --> 01:24:34,225
Rambo, don't do it!

714
01:24:35,184 --> 01:24:36,523
Listen to me, Rambo!

715
01:24:36,813 --> 01:24:37,852
You have no chance.

716
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:40,349
Drop your weapon.

717
01:24:41,938 --> 01:24:45,394
We're gonna order a chopper
in and fly you back to Bragg.

718
01:24:47,682 --> 01:24:48,771
Hold your fire!

719
01:24:53,476 --> 01:24:54,395
Hold your fire!

720
01:24:54,725 --> 01:24:56,473
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

721
01:24:57,602 --> 01:24:59,061
Think about what you're doin'.

722
01:25:01,059 --> 01:25:04,355
The building's perimeter's
covered. No exits.

723
01:25:05,015 --> 01:25:07,732
There's nearly 200 men
out there and a lot of M16s!

724
01:25:08,181 --> 01:25:10,399
You did everything to make
this private war happen.

725
01:25:11,768 --> 01:25:13,566
You've done enough damage!

726
01:25:14,016 --> 01:25:16,273
This mission is over, Rambo.
Do you understand me?

727
01:25:17,732 --> 01:25:18,891
This mission is over!

728
01:25:22,477 --> 01:25:23,816
Look at 'em out there.

729
01:25:27,102 --> 01:25:28,101
Look at 'em!

730
01:25:31,268 --> 01:25:32,977
If you won't end this
happen, they'll kill you!

731
01:25:34,515 --> 01:25:35,934
Is that what you want?

732
01:25:39,350 --> 01:25:42,147
It's over, Johnny. It's OVER!

733
01:25:42,517 --> 01:25:47,142
Nothing is over! Nothing!
You just don't turn it off!

734
01:25:47,852 --> 01:25:51,188
It wasn't my war. You
asked me, I didn't ask you!

735
01:25:52,018 --> 01:25:55,184
And I did what I had to do to win,
but someone wouldn't let us win.

736
01:25:55,774 --> 01:25:58,231
And I come back to
the world, and I see all

737
01:25:58,231 --> 01:26:00,939
those maggots at the
airport, protestin' me, spittin'.

738
01:26:01,438 --> 01:26:03,896
Callin' me baby killer
and all kinds of vile crap!

739
01:26:05,274 --> 01:26:07,852
Who are they to protest
me, huh? Who are they?

740
01:26:08,021 --> 01:26:09,600
Unless they've been me and been there,

741
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,268
and know what the
hell they're yellin' about?

742
01:26:11,308 --> 01:26:14,725
It was a bad time for everyone,
Rambo. It's all in the past now.

743
01:26:14,765 --> 01:26:17,392
FOR YOU! For me,
civilian life is nothing.

744
01:26:18,101 --> 01:26:19,770
In the field, we had a code of honor.

745
01:26:20,019 --> 01:26:23,266
You watch my back, I watch
yours. Back here, there's nothing!

746
01:26:23,396 --> 01:26:27,312
You're the last of an elite
group... don't end it like this.

747
01:26:27,312 --> 01:26:29,940
Back there I could fly a
gunship, I could drive a tank,

748
01:26:30,019 --> 01:26:31,978
I was in charge of a
million dollar equipment!

749
01:26:32,227 --> 01:26:35,224
Back here, I can't even
hold a job parking cars!

750
01:26:45,274 --> 01:26:46,353
Where is everybody?

751
01:26:52,557 --> 01:26:55,224
I had a friend, who
was in the Air Force.

752
01:26:56,982 --> 01:27:01,268
There were all these guys, man.
Back there were all these fuckin guys!

753
01:27:01,768 --> 01:27:03,396
Who were my friends!

754
01:27:03,436 --> 01:27:06,643
Back here, there's nothing!
Remember Dan Forest?

755
01:27:08,231 --> 01:27:09,100
Wore this black headband.

756
01:27:09,310 --> 01:27:11,398
I took one of his magic
markers, and I said:

757
01:27:11,478 --> 01:27:13,975
"If found, you mail this to Las Vegas",

758
01:27:13,975 --> 01:27:15,724
'cause we were always
talkin' about Vegas,

759
01:27:15,814 --> 01:27:19,440
and this fuckin' car. This so
great '58 Chevy convertible!

760
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:20,809
He was talkin' about his car,

761
01:27:20,809 --> 01:27:23,856
he said we'd get cruised
till the tires fell off!

762
01:27:31,768 --> 01:27:33,935
We were in this bar in
Saigon, and this kid comes up,

763
01:27:34,565 --> 01:27:36,643
this kid carrying a shoe shine box.

764
01:27:36,813 --> 01:27:39,440
And there, he says:
"Shine please, shine!"

765
01:27:39,979 --> 01:27:43,146
I said no, and he kept askin',
yeah, and Joe would say 'yeah'.

766
01:27:43,646 --> 01:27:45,474
And... I went to get a couple of beers.

767
01:27:46,183 --> 01:27:49,230
And the box was wired.
He opened up the box...

768
01:27:49,690 --> 01:27:51,518
Fucking blew his
body all over the place.

769
01:27:52,767 --> 01:27:54,225
He's laying there and
he's fucking screaming,

770
01:27:54,225 --> 01:27:55,774
there's pieces of him all over me!

771
01:27:57,182 --> 01:28:01,148
And I'm trying to pull them off, you
know... my friend! It's all over me!

772
01:28:01,937 --> 01:28:03,266
I got blood and everything and...

773
01:28:03,266 --> 01:28:05,814
I'm trying to hold him
together, I put him together

774
01:28:05,854 --> 01:28:07,812
the fucking entrails keep coming out!

775
01:28:08,271 --> 01:28:10,099
And nobody would help!

776
01:28:10,599 --> 01:28:14,645
He's saying, sayin', "I want to
go home!" just calling my name.

777
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:17,812
"I wanna go home, Johnny,
I wanna drive my Chevy!"

778
01:28:17,812 --> 01:28:20,019
I said: "Why I can't
find your fuckin' legs. "

779
01:28:20,938 --> 01:28:22,437
"I can't find your legs!"

780
01:28:24,185 --> 01:28:28,811
I can't get it out of my
head. It was seven years.

781
01:28:29,310 --> 01:28:30,809
Every day it hurts.

782
01:28:31,308 --> 01:28:37,102
Sometimes I wake up and don't know
where I am. I don't talk to anybody.

783
01:28:37,931 --> 01:28:39,810
Sometimes a day.

784
01:28:41,608 --> 01:28:43,396
Sometimes a week.

785
01:28:44,565 --> 01:28:47,232
I can't put it outta my mind...
