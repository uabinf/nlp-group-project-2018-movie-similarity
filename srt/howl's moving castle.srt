1
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,740
Stinks!

2
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,580
You reek of burnt flesh and steel.

3
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,350
Keep flying and one day you
won't be able to change yourself back.

4
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,460
Isn't it great!
Sophie did this for me.

5
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,500
The fighting is fierce.

6
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:25,240
The country's ablaze, from the
southern coast to the northern border.

7
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,010
I hate the fire in gunpowder.

8
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,830
They have no manners.

9
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,060
- My own kind attacked me.
- The Witch of the Waste?

10
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,600
Hack wizards masquerading
as monsters.

11
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,180
They'll cry plenty later on,

12
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,440
when they can't regain human form.

13
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,070
No, they'll just forget
they ever knew how to cry.

14
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,850
Aren't you supposed to report
to the king yourself?

15
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,310
Yes, well...

16
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,940
Hot water for my bath.

17
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,950
Oh, no, not again.

18
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,230
Is that Howl?

19
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,570
Yeah, wasting my hot water again.

20
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,820
I'm sure Howl won't eat any breakfast.

21
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,910
No matter.

22
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,670
Morning.

23
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,760
It's lovely shopping in the morning.

24
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,710
I've never seen the ocean!

25
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,430
Such beautiful, sparkling water!

26
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,540
Same as it always is.

27
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,720
I myself hate potatoes.

28
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,110
Pay up.

29
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,600
Thank you.

30
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,730
Thanks.

31
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,110
Fish, all fresh off the boat.

32
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,040
- That one's tasty.
- I myself hate fish.

33
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,400
The fleet's come home!

34
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,410
- Is that the smoke?
- There's been another battle.

35
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,540
Really? Sorry, lady, later.

36
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,300
That ship's on fire!

37
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,570
Sophie, let's go get a closer look.

38
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,870
No, I've no stomach for such things.
Let's go home.

39
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,160
Our most advanced battleship,
reduced to this.

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,070
Markl, there are Blob Men nearby.

41
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,840
Don't move.

42
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,160
They work for the Witch of the Waste.

43
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,210
They're gone.

44
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,640
Don't people notice
those terrible monsters?

45
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,270
Look! Up there!

46
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,350
That's what dropped those bombs!

47
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,310
An enemy airship, Sophie!

48
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,110
Sophie, flyers!

49
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,440
Ignore the flyers!
They're enemy propaganda!

50
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,650
Are you OK, Sophie?

51
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,960
A glass of water, please

52
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,180
Sure.

53
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,820
Sophie, what did you do
to the bathroom shelves? Look!

54
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,900
My hair's turned this weird color!

55
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,830
What... what beautiful hair.

56
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,040
Take a good look!

57
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,650
You mixed up everything on
the shelves and ruined the spells!

58
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,420
I didn't mix up anything,
I simply cleaned up.

59
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,410
Cleaning, always cleaning.

60
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:37,130
I told you not to get
too carried away!

61
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,620
It's hopeless!

62
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,290
How humiliating.

63
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,550
It's not so very bad.

64
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,350
This new shade's quite lovely
in its way.

65
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:57,990
I'm done for.

66
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,370
What's the point in living,
if you aren't beautiful?

67
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,740
Stop, Howl! Cut it out!

68
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,160
He's calling on
the spirits of Darkness.

69
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,300
He did this last time
a girl ditched him.

70
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,720
Please, Howl, that's enough.

71
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,630
You can just dye your hair again.

72
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,610
I've had enough of you, Howl!

73
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,660
I've never once been beautiful!

74
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,250
I've had enough of this place!

75
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,460
Thank you, Turnip
You're a kind scarecrow

76
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:36,370
Please come back, Sophie.
Howl's in trouble!

77
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,960
Cut it out, Howl!
I'm going out!

78
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,380
Sophie!

79
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,830
Get over here!

80
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,340
My, he's dramatic.

81
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,640
Is he dead?

82
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,850
Don't worry.
A tantrum never killed anyone.

83
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,690
Help me, Markl.

84
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,190
Get that hot water running, Markl!

85
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,320
C'mon, you can still walk.

86
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,670
You look after him now, Markl.

87
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,910
Sure.

88
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,410
I'll have to clean all over again.

89
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,280
I'm coming in.

90
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,240
Here's some hot milk.
Drink up.

91
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,210
I'll leave it here.
Drink it while it's hot.

92
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,710
Don't leave me, Sophie.

93
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,400
Try a little milk?

94
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,570
The Witch of the Waste
is searching for my house.

95
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,320
You're right, I saw her cronies
down at the port.

96
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,590
The truth is, I'm a coward.

97
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,290
All this junk is just sorcery
to keep her away.

98
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,080
I'm scared to death.

99
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,090
Tell me, why is
the Witch of the Waste after you?

100
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,970
She seemed quite interesting,
so I approached her.

101
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:00,600
But she terrified me
and I ran away.

102
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,820
Now the king's ordered me
to report to him.

103
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,400
As Jenkins and as Pendragon...

104
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,020
How many names do you use, Howl?

105
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,530
Enough to guarantee my freedom.

106
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,120
Can't you refuse the king?

107
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,450
See that...

108
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:24,160
The oath I took at
the Sorcery Academy.

109
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:29,040
Say, Howl.
Why not visit the king?

110
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,750
What!

111
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,040
Just say it to his face.

112
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,880
"Stop this foolish war
I refuse to help you."

113
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,800
Sophie, you don't know
what they're like.

114
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,540
But he's the king, right?

115
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:46,970
A king thinks only
of what's best for his people.

116
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,300
I know!

117
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,740
You'll go in my place, Sophie!

118
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,320
Pretend you're Pendragon's mother.

119
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,750
Just tell him your son is
an idle good-for-nothing.

120
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,750
Maybe Madam Suliman
will even give up on me.

121
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,130
Madam Suliman?

122
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,260
You're wearing that hat?

123
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,760
After all the magic I spent
making your dress pretty...

124
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:13,920
Off I go.

125
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,170
Sure!

126
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,340
See you later!

127
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,940
This charm
assures your safe return.

128
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:32,860
Don't worry,
I'll follow you in disguise.

129
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,600
There.
Off you go!

130
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,450
I'm sure this will never work.

131
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,630
I don't suppose he's following me,
disguised as a crow.

132
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,810
I'm sure Howl would pick
a more dramatic disguise

133
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,480
Not that...

134
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,870
The Palace is so far away.

135
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,700
Howl?
Don't tell me you're Howl.

136
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,550
Disguising yourself as an old dog,
of all things.

137
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,890
Do you know how exhausting
it is to be old?

138
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,300
How nice to see you.
The little hatter, right?

139
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,260
The Witch of the Waste!

140
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,400
Thank you so much for
delivering my note to Howl.

141
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,900
How's Howl doing?

142
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,080
Quite terrified.

143
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,370
Thanks to him,
I've become a cleaning lady.

144
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,240
My, how delightful.

145
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,490
By the way, what brings you
to see the king?

146
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:57,080
Job hunting.
I'm sick of working for Howl.

147
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,250
And yourself?

148
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,540
The king invited me.

149
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,340
It seems that idiot, Suliman,

150
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,270
finally needs my power.

151
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,880
Why don't you break the spell
you put on me?

152
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,840
That's impossible.

153
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,110
My gifts lie in casting spells,
not breaking them.

154
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,560
See you later, then.

155
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:22,440
Hey, wait a minute!
Just wait!

156
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,280
If you weren't here,
I'd have hit her with my cane.

157
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,630
What's wrong with you?

158
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,340
Madam, vehicles are prohibited
beyond this point.

159
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,970
Please continue on foot.

160
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,970
That Suliman!

161
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:57,030
Using magic to force me
to climb these stairs.

162
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,410
We'll catch up.
Pay her no mind.

163
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:38,570
Heavy, why are you so heavy?

164
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,360
You... Hey... Wait.

165
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,110
What is it?

166
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:58,410
Suddenly remembered...
how to break my spell?

167
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:02,220
I told you...

168
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,380
I don't know how.

169
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,550
Then, start studying up.

170
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,390
I don't get it.

171
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,720
Where does she get all that energy?

172
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,820
I have to put you down.

173
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,910
Why don't you call it a day?
You can't make it.

174
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,790
It's been 50 years now,

175
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,460
since they drove me out of here...

176
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,660
I've been longing

177
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,580
for this day, ever since...

178
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,500
Good luck to you, then.

179
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,840
Still, I'm not nice enough
to help you out.

180
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,010
Come, Howl.

181
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,220
You heartless wench!

182
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,930
Next time I'll turn you feeble, too!

183
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,980
Hurry up!

184
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,050
Madam, follow me.

185
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,390
First, you should help her.

186
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,460
We are forbidden to assist anyone.

187
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:35,810
But the king himself invited her.

188
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,260
Hang in there!

189
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,850
Just a little farther!

190
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,110
And you call yourself a witch?

191
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,150
Who asked you?

192
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,690
You suddenly look older.

193
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,990
Madam Pendragon and
the Witch of the Waste!

194
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,070
Pull yourself together.

195
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:01,580
Isn't this
what you've been waiting for?

196
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,090
Madam Pendragon and
the Witch of the Waste!

197
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,350
Pendragon...
That name sounds familiar.

198
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:16,010
Of course it does.
That was the name of my hat shop.

199
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,220
It was?

200
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,590
Please wait here.

201
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,190
A chair!

202
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,360
It's mine!

203
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,030
Howl, get back here!

204
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,800
Madam, this way please.

205
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,220
I understand you're Howl's mother.

206
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,220
Yes.
My name is Pendragon.

207
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,230
I'm sure you're weary.
Please have a seat.

208
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,950
Yes.

209
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,260
I am Madam Suliman,
His Majesty's witch.

210
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,760
Um, that dog is...

211
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,020
Ah, you mean Heen?

212
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,600
He does my errands.
I asked him to escort you.

213
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,110
Howl won't join us, then?

214
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,720
You see, he sends his mother
to make excuses.

215
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,620
I'm sure he'd be utterly useless
to His Majesty.

216
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:47,460
What a shame.

217
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:50,780
He was my last apprentice...

218
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,960
A student of such marvelous gifts.

219
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:59,080
I rejoiced in finally finding
a worthy heir.

220
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:04,630
But then, a demon stole his heart,

221
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,970
and he abandoned me.

222
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:11,320
He turned his magic
to purely selfish uses.

223
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,890
Mrs. Pendragon.

224
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,160
That boy is dangerous.

225
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,480
His power is too great
for one with no heart.

226
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:26,650
If he follows that path he'll wind up
like the Witch of the Waste.

227
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:27,660
Bring her!

228
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,870
What happened?

229
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,050
I just restored her to her real age.

230
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,810
All her powers are gone.

231
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:47,340
Once upon a time,
she was a magnificent witch.

232
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,650
She made a bargain with a demon.

233
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,940
Who consumed her, body and soul,
long, long ago.

234
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,940
Our kingdom can no longer afford
to turn a blind eye

235
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,060
to disreputable wizards and witches.

236
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,650
If Howl comes here
to serve the kingdom,

237
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:06,570
I will teach him how to break
with the demon.

238
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,880
If not, I'll strip him of his powers
as I have taken hers.

239
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:13,030
Now just a minute.

240
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,710
Now I understand why Howl
refused to come here.

241
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,760
Something's not right.

242
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,640
Forcing your aged guests
to climb stairs, dragging them

243
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:25,550
into strange rooms...
It's like a trap.

244
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,920
You call Howl heartless!

245
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,900
Yes, he's selfish and cowardly
and unpredictable.

246
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,610
But he's straight as an arrow.
He only wants to be free.

247
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,900
Howl won't turn into an evil monster.

248
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,730
He'll battle the demon on his own.

249
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,610
I believe in him.

250
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:46,900
Mrs. Pendragon...
You're in love with Howl.

251
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:50,780
Howl...
Howl's coming?

252
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:54,250
I want Howl's heart, I want it!

253
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,910
That's enough from you.
Howl's not coming.

254
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,630
Howl will most certainly come.

255
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,170
Now, I've found his weakness.

256
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,930
Your Majesty.

257
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,690
As you are.

258
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,270
How are you feeling?

259
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,720
Thank you for asking.

260
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,140
Meetings bore me.
I flew out for a breather.

261
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,100
How lovely.

262
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,810
These are...?

263
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,440
This is Wizard Howl's mother.

264
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,940
I see.

265
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,280
I appreciate it, but I don't intend
to win any war with magic.

266
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:40,920
It's true that Suliman's powers
shield our palace from bombs.

267
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,540
But they just fall on
neighboring towns.

268
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,250
That's how magic works.
Right, Suliman?

269
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,930
Such eloquence today, Your Majesty.

270
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,130
Suliman!

271
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,840
This is the final battle.
This time, we'll beat them to a pulp.

272
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,860
Suliman, you've outdone yourself
with that double. Await good news.

273
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:05,980
Thank you kindly.

274
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,310
Have my generals assembled?

275
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,940
It's been awhile, Howl.

276
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,790
Delighted to see you doing so well.

277
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,990
I saw right through you.

278
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,290
Not a very clever disguise.

279
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,250
I've kept my oath.

280
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,920
I've no wish to fight you.

281
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,710
I'll take my mother.

282
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,670
I won't let you go.

283
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:53,290
Don't look down,
you'll be dragged down.

284
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,820
It's time I showed your mother
what you really are.

285
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,800
Howl, don't! It's a trap!

286
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,240
Hold tight!

287
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,750
Sophie, sit up front.

288
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:23,410
Oh, no, Sophie,
you brought the whole gang along.

289
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,990
Nice doggie.

290
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,710
You're just Suliman's spy.

291
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:32,540
Oh, well, too late to toss you now.

292
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,140
Sophie, you steer.

293
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,720
What! I can't possibly!

294
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,310
They're after us.

295
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,640
I'll tackle them. Fly straight
to the castle in the Wastes.

296
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,600
What! That's impossible!

297
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,770
Don't worry,
the ring will guide you.

298
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:54,150
Summon Calcifer with your heart.

299
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:55,830
Summon Calcifer?

300
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,280
It's glowing!

301
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,670
Follow the light.
You'll be there by nightfall.

302
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,300
Why send me to Suliman
if you were coming yourself?

303
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,970
Your presence gave me
the courage for it.

304
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,330
She's too terrible to
face on my own.

305
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:18,010
You've saved me.
I was in grave danger back there.

306
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,520
Don't let go!

307
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,780
- You're good
- Stop joking!

308
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,030
We've got a lead now.

309
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:37,120
I can give you 5 minutes of
invisibility, now's your chance.

310
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,110
Howl!

311
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,250
No, thank you.

312
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,130
Thank you. That's the most fun
I've had in ages.

313
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,640
I supposed Howl thinks
he's escaped...

314
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,680
His mother's awfully young.

315
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,780
We're not far.
That's my hometown.

316
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,620
Don't look so friendly.
I don't trust you.

317
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,640
The castle.
They've come to meet us!

318
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,660
Sophie!

319
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,660
Markl, help!

320
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:43,660
I don't know how to stop this thing!

321
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,550
Sophie!

322
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,010
Doggie.

323
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:02,970
Markl!

324
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,220
I'm home.

325
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,560
Sophie, are you hurt?

326
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:09,760
You're home!

327
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:12,680
Thank you for coming to meet us.

328
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,760
Oh, no, you've gone too far.

329
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,540
I wonder if Howl's back.

330
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:02,210
Howl?

331
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,360
Howl? Is it you?

332
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,740
Are you hurt? In pain?

333
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,740
Stay away.

334
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,040
I want to help you.

335
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:19,070
I want to break
the spell you're under.

336
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:23,580
You can't even break
your own spell!

337
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:26,090
But I love you!

338
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,340
Too late.

339
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,800
Howl!

340
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,570
Howl must be back.

341
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:53,110
Sophie, you'd better figure out
how to break my spell quick.

342
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,700
We're both running out of time.

343
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,700
Meaning Howl will turn into
a monster? Is it true?

344
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,990
I can't tell you that.

345
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,330
I'm a demon.

346
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,540
Calcifer, Suliman told me,

347
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,590
Howl has given you
something very precious.

348
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,710
What is it?
Where is it?

349
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:14,550
That's confidential information.

350
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:17,220
And if I threaten
to dump water over you?

351
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,970
How dare you!
Howl will die with me!

352
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,460
Good morning, Turnip.

353
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,570
We've got to be brave.

354
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,910
Ready, Sophie!

355
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,380
OK! Open wider, Calcifer!

356
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:56,590
Here goes! Push!

357
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,340
Heave!

358
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:11,020
I... said... move!

359
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,590
Come on!

360
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:38,300
They call it a castle, but once
you get inside, it's a junk heap.

361
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,840
It's time to eat!

362
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,900
Here, old girl.

363
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,860
But, Sophie
she's the Witch of the Waste.

364
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,610
No need to worry.

365
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,820
Why's she staring at me?

366
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:01,360
Such a pretty fire.

367
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:05,160
Howl!

368
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,490
Hello, everyone.

369
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:09,800
- Welcome home.
- Master Howl, can we keep this puppy?

370
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:13,420
An old Witch and
Madam Suliman's dog.

371
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,790
Why'd you let them in, Calcifer?

372
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,420
Don't look at me!

373
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,050
They blew in with Sophie.

374
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,800
Sophie, always dramatic...

375
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,720
So you're Turnip.

376
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,230
You're under quite a spell, too.

377
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,490
Seems everyone in our little family
is complicated...

378
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,690
He's so handsome.

379
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:41,320
This is a busy day.
We're moving.

380
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:42,610
Moving?

381
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:45,820
Oh, good. There aren't any shops,
here in the middle of nowhere.

382
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,750
Madam Suliman can track us down
in no time, here.

383
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:54,070
But you'll have to stay behind.
The magic in your spell's too risky.

384
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,750
All right, that's done.

385
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,630
Take it away, Calcifer.

386
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,240
Excellent.

387
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:22,910
Stay right where you are.

388
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,320
Be gentle...

389
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,920
Here goes.

390
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:20,210
We've moved.
You can get up now.

391
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,630
Amazing, Master!
It's so grand!

392
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:28,010
What a pretty fire.

393
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,480
This is...

394
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,110
I added a bathroom.
For our growing family.

395
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,900
Sophie, come here!
Sophie!

396
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,700
I added a bedroom, too.
Go in.

397
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,920
This is... why?

398
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:12,340
I thought it would suit you.
Do you like it?

399
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:17,190
Yes, it's perfect
for a housekeeper.

400
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,240
I got you new clothes, too.
Open them later. Next.

401
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,800
Sophie! Come here!
Quick!

402
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,200
A courtyard!

403
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,820
There's a shop, too.

404
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,150
Let's go, Heen!

405
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:34,030
See that new color on the dial?
There's a new exit.
