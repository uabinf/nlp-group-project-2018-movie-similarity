01:42:00,032 --> 01:42:01,200
Who are you, John?

1368
01:42:02,284 --> 01:42:04,077
Who are you really?

1369
01:42:04,369 --> 01:42:05,454
What do you mean?

1370
01:42:05,621 --> 01:42:09,374
At this stage, what harm can it do
to tell us a bit about yourself?

1371
01:42:09,875 --> 01:42:13,045
It doesn't matter who I am.
Who I am means absolutely nothing.

1372
01:42:13,212 --> 01:42:15,130
You need to stay on your left up here.

1373
01:42:19,384 --> 01:42:21,094
So where are we heading?

1374
01:42:21,762 --> 01:42:22,805
You'll see.

1375
01:42:23,555 --> 01:42:27,059
We're not just going to pick up
two more dead bodies, are we, John?

1376
01:42:27,559 --> 01:42:29,436
That wouldn't be shocking enough.

1377
01:42:29,603 --> 01:42:32,731
We've got newspapers
to think about, yeah?

1378
01:42:33,816 --> 01:42:36,026
Wanting people to listen...

1379
01:42:36,193 --> 01:42:39,738
...you can't just tap them
on the shoulder anymore.

1380
01:42:39,905 --> 01:42:42,282
You have to hit them
with a sledgehammer.

1381
01:42:42,449 --> 01:42:45,410
And then you'll notice
you've got their strict attention.

1382
01:42:45,577 --> 01:42:47,454
MILLS:
But the question is:

1383
01:42:47,621 --> 01:42:50,290
What makes you so special
that people should listen?

1384
01:42:50,833 --> 01:42:51,959
I'm not special.

1386
01:42:55,921 --> 01:42:59,591
<i>This is, though, what I'm doing.
My work.</i>

1387
01:43:00,050 --> 01:43:01,343
Your work, John?

1388
01:43:01,927 --> 01:43:03,053
Yes.

1389
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:06,181
See, I don't—
I don't see anything special about it, John.

1390
01:43:07,599 --> 01:43:08,642
That's not true.

1391
01:43:08,809 --> 01:43:09,893
No, it is true.

1392
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:13,230
And the funny thing is, all this work...

1393
01:43:13,397 --> 01:43:15,399
...two months from now,
no one's gonna care.

1394
01:43:15,566 --> 01:43:17,901
No one's gonna give a shit,
no one's gonna remember.

1395
01:43:18,068 --> 01:43:21,113
You can't see the whole complete
act yet.

1396
01:43:21,864 --> 01:43:23,448
But when this is done...

1397
01:43:24,783 --> 01:43:26,118
...when it's finished...

1398
01:43:27,953 --> 01:43:29,454
...it's going to be....

1399
01:43:32,457 --> 01:43:35,794
People will barely be able
to comprehend.

1400
01:43:35,961 --> 01:43:38,005
But they won't be able to deny.

1401
01:43:39,631 --> 01:43:41,091
Could the freak be more vague?

1402
01:43:42,259 --> 01:43:44,511
I mean, as far as master plans go, John—

1403
01:43:44,678 --> 01:43:48,515
I can't wait for you to see. I really can't.
It's really going to be something.

1404
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:52,311
Well, you know what?
I'm gonna be standing next to you.

1405
01:43:52,477 --> 01:43:55,731
So when this big thing happens,
you be sure and let me know.

1406
01:43:55,898 --> 01:43:59,401
- Because I wouldn't wanna miss it.
JOHN: Oh, don't worry.

1407
01:43:59,568 --> 01:44:00,611
You won't.

1408
01:44:02,613 --> 01:44:04,740
You won't miss a thing.

I've been trying to figure something
in my head.

1416
01:44:45,739 --> 01:44:48,116
And maybe you can help me out, yeah?

1417
01:44:49,534 --> 01:44:53,705
When a person is insane,
as you clearly are...

1418
01:44:53,872 --> 01:44:56,208
...do you know that you're insane?

1419
01:44:56,375 --> 01:44:58,794
Maybe you're sitting around,
reading <i>Guns and Ammo...</i>

1420
01:44:58,961 --> 01:45:02,214
...masturbating in your own feces,
do you just stop and go:

01:45:02,381 --> 01:45:05,884
"Wow, it is amazing how fucking crazy
I really am"?

1422
01:45:06,218 --> 01:45:08,553
Yeah? Do you guys do that?

1423
01:45:09,388 --> 01:45:12,057
It's more comfortable
for you to label me insane.

1424
01:45:12,224 --> 01:45:13,433
It's very comfortable.

1425
01:45:14,226 --> 01:45:17,562
It's not something I would expect
you to accept.

1426
01:45:17,938 --> 01:45:20,732
But I did not choose. I was chosen.

1427
01:45:21,149 --> 01:45:24,778
MILLS: Well, whatever.
- I don't doubt that you believe that, John.

1428
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:29,408
But seems to me that you're overlooking
a glaring contradiction.

1429
01:45:29,574 --> 01:45:30,826
Meaning what?

1430
01:45:32,035 --> 01:45:33,954
Glad you asked.

1431
01:45:35,288 --> 01:45:36,915
If you were chosen...

1432
01:45:37,082 --> 01:45:40,919
...that is, by a higher power...

1433
01:45:41,670 --> 01:45:43,505
...and if your hand was forced...

1434
01:45:44,089 --> 01:45:47,175
...it seems strange to me
that you'd get such enjoyment out of it.

1435
01:45:47,843 --> 01:45:50,721
You enjoyed torturing those people.

1436
01:45:51,430 --> 01:45:54,933
This doesn't seem in keeping
with martyrdom, does it?

1437
01:45:56,101 --> 01:45:57,310
John?

1438
01:46:02,149 --> 01:46:05,027
I doubt I enjoyed it
any more than Detective Mills...

1439
01:46:05,193 --> 01:46:08,905
...would enjoy time alone with me
in a room without windows.

01:46:09,489 --> 01:46:11,283
Isn't that true?

1441
01:46:11,616 --> 01:46:14,536
How happy would it make you
to hurt me with impunity.

1442
01:46:14,703 --> 01:46:15,787
That hurts my feelings.

1443
01:46:17,372 --> 01:46:20,542
- I would never—
- You wouldn't because there's consequences.

It's in those eyes of yours, though.

Nothing wrong with a man
taking pleasure in his work.

I won't deny my own personal desire
to turn each sin against the sinner.

1447
01:46:34,181 --> 01:46:37,434
Wait a minute, I thought all you did
was kill innocent people.

01:46:39,436 --> 01:46:42,022
Innocent? Is that supposed to be funny?

1449
01:46:42,898 --> 01:46:44,357
An obese man.

A disgusting man
who could barely stand up.

1451
01:46:47,194 --> 01:46:51,490
If you saw him, you'd point him out to your
friends so they'd join you in mocking him.

A man, who if you saw him
while you were eating...

1453
01:46:54,117 --> 01:46:56,661
...you wouldn't be able
to finish your meal.

1454

And after him, lawyer. You must've
secretly been thanking me for that one.

1455
01:47:00,999 --> 01:47:03,919
This is a man who dedicated his life...

1456
01:47:04,086 --> 01:47:08,715
...to making money by lying
with every breath that he could muster...

1457
01:47:08,882 --> 01:47:11,760
...to keeping murderers and rapists
on the streets.

couldn't bear to go on living...

...if she couldn't be beautiful

A drug dealing pederast, actually.

...in every home and we tolerate it.

1469
01:47:49,923 --> 01:47:52,676
We tolerate it
because it's common, it's....

01:47:52,843 --> 01:47:54,511
It's trivial.

...puzzled over...

1476
01:48:12,070 --> 01:48:13,905
...and studied...

1477
01:48:14,698 --> 01:48:16,408

to be remembered after this.

Realize, detective, the only reason
that I'm here right now...

1485

Toying with me?

until you felt like springing your trap?

1490
01:48:53,361 --> 01:48:57,449
Tell me, what was the indisputable evidence
you were going to use on me...

1491
01:48:57,616 --> 01:49:02,078
...right before I walked up to you
and put my hands in the air?
