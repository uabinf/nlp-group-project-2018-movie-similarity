1
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,797
Can't he go any faster, Jesse?

2
00:03:03,636 --> 00:03:04,967
Goin' fast enough, Ed.

3
00:03:08,975 --> 00:03:11,876
- You watch them people, Frank.
- Shut up, Ed!

4
00:03:19,785 --> 00:03:22,982
- What about that safe?
- There ain't no safe, Ed.

5
00:03:23,222 --> 00:03:26,157
All the money's in the strongbox
and in the cash drawers.

6
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:29,223
I don't believe you!
You got a safe in here someplace.

7
00:03:29,295 --> 00:03:32,230
You tell me where it is,
or I'm gonna put a bullet in your brain.

8
00:03:32,298 --> 00:03:35,096
- Honest, Mister.
- Get out of here, Ed!

9
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:38,969
Are you going crazy, Ed?

10
00:03:41,574 --> 00:03:42,973
Watch it, Jesse!

11
00:03:47,246 --> 00:03:48,338
Jesse!

12
00:04:26,685 --> 00:04:29,210
How long you think it'll take
that posse to get here?

13
00:04:29,288 --> 00:04:30,846
There won't be one.

14
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,753
They'll go about 10 miles and get tired
and go back and call the Pinkertons.

15
00:04:37,263 --> 00:04:41,256
- How come we're standing guard?
- 'Cause every once in a while, I'm wrong.

16
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,898
We'll take you upriver to Mimm's house.

17
00:04:49,608 --> 00:04:51,405
Get the bullet out there.

18
00:04:53,178 --> 00:04:55,009
- You stay quiet, now.
- Yeah.

19
00:05:00,553 --> 00:05:02,020
Come here, Ed.

20
00:05:16,035 --> 00:05:17,764
Jesse! Jesse!

21
00:05:19,705 --> 00:05:22,868
- Shit, what'd you do that for?
- For panickin' and shootin' innocent folks.

22
00:05:22,942 --> 00:05:23,931
Jesse!

23
00:05:24,076 --> 00:05:26,840
That's for goddamn getting me near killed!

24
00:05:31,617 --> 00:05:33,551
Shit, I didn't mean no harm.

25
00:05:34,353 --> 00:05:37,811
You're through, Ed.
You ain't gonna ride with me no more.

26
00:05:42,661 --> 00:05:44,629
You gonna take that off him?

27
00:05:45,864 --> 00:05:47,695
I seen what you done.

28
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,601
You may be family and everything,
but I ain't sidin' with you.

29
00:05:52,004 --> 00:05:53,767
You're on your own.

30
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:01,970
Cole, give him his cut.

31
00:06:22,901 --> 00:06:25,233
You threw yourself away a good livin'.

32
00:06:26,739 --> 00:06:28,138
Now, listen good.

33
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,741
Anybody connects the Jameses
or the Youngers with that bank...

34
00:06:31,844 --> 00:06:33,368
...you're a dead man.

35
00:07:18,457 --> 00:07:20,789
Hey, now, I saw her first.

36
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,451
Step back away. I saw her first.

37
00:07:29,935 --> 00:07:31,869
What the hell was that all about?

38
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:34,133
Damned if I know.

39
00:07:34,406 --> 00:07:37,842
"And although he may be poor

40
00:07:38,877 --> 00:07:42,313
"Not a man shall be a slave

41
00:07:43,782 --> 00:07:46,842
"Shoutin' the battle

42
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:50,079
"Cry of freedom"

43
00:07:50,556 --> 00:07:52,683
You boys hear what I hear?

44
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,358
I hear it.

45
00:07:57,796 --> 00:08:00,321
Yeah, better go talk to this fella.

46
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:03,259
I'm out.

47
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:08,662
"From the east and from the west

48
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:16,148
"Shouting the battle cry of freedom

49
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:21,614
"And we'll prove a loyal crew"

50
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:25,381
You've got real nice hands.

51
00:08:26,992 --> 00:08:28,482
They're real pretty.

52
00:08:32,364 --> 00:08:33,854
You want to keep them?

53
00:08:35,234 --> 00:08:36,792
It was just a request.

54
00:08:39,772 --> 00:08:41,740
Well, I got a request of my own.

55
00:08:44,476 --> 00:08:45,966
<i>I'm a Good Ol' Rebel.</i>

56
00:08:53,318 --> 00:08:55,809
"Oh, I'm a good old rebel

57
00:08:55,888 --> 00:08:58,186
"Now, that's just what I am

58
00:08:58,724 --> 00:09:01,420
"For this fair land of freedom

59
00:09:01,627 --> 00:09:03,652
"I do not care a damn

60
00:09:04,229 --> 00:09:07,062
"I'm glad I fought against it

61
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:09,224
"I only wish we'd won

62
00:09:09,902 --> 00:09:12,427
"And I don't want no pardon

63
00:09:12,638 --> 00:09:15,471
"For anything I done"

64
00:09:20,312 --> 00:09:22,109
You keep losin', at this rate...

65
00:09:22,181 --> 00:09:23,648
...you'll have to go out
and rob another train.

66
00:09:23,715 --> 00:09:25,979
And scare some more innocent folk
half to death.

67
00:09:26,351 --> 00:09:28,649
"I hates the declaration... "

68
00:09:28,787 --> 00:09:33,190
- Never liked people standing behind me.
- Well, most people would be flattered.

69
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:36,193
Ain't often Belle Shirley
stands behind a man.

70
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,423
I reckon that's the truth.

71
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:43,432
"I fought it all I could"

72
00:09:53,645 --> 00:09:55,738
Are you still asking $15?

73
00:09:56,915 --> 00:09:58,610
I sure am.

74
00:10:02,054 --> 00:10:04,386
Well, ain't nothing worth that price.

75
00:10:04,489 --> 00:10:05,751
Well...

76
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:08,659
...I don't figure I'll miss much.

77
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:14,091
But I'll tell you what I will do.

78
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,936
I'll go $12.50 for you,
since you're about to go broke.

79
00:10:22,407 --> 00:10:23,704
I only got $11.

80
00:10:24,243 --> 00:10:25,608
Cut you for it.

81
00:10:26,678 --> 00:10:28,543
Make your move.

82
00:10:47,065 --> 00:10:48,999
I'll be go to hell.

83
00:10:52,671 --> 00:10:55,731
When your luck changes,
you feel free to call on me.

84
00:11:00,812 --> 00:11:02,507
Everybody ante up, huh?

85
00:11:08,654 --> 00:11:09,643
Women.

86
00:11:10,756 --> 00:11:11,745
Love 'em.

87
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:15,893
We's all in the war.

88
00:11:16,762 --> 00:11:18,992
Robbed a first Yankee bank...

89
00:11:19,531 --> 00:11:21,590
...'cause we didn't know no better.

90
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:24,431
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

91
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,332
After that, we's just in the habit.

92
00:11:29,241 --> 00:11:32,369
So I guess we'll just keep on going...

93
00:11:32,978 --> 00:11:35,970
...till they lock us up or hang us.

94
00:11:56,835 --> 00:11:59,360
You've hardly given yourself
time enough to heal.

95
00:11:59,738 --> 00:12:01,467
I gotta get back to things.

96
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,736
Ma needs money to help
keep the farm going.

97
00:12:06,378 --> 00:12:10,576
I reckon your ma can keep the farm going
and a few more things to boot.

98
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:13,284
Well, the others ain't no good without me.

99
00:12:13,952 --> 00:12:16,750
They gotta have somebody
to make the plans.

100
00:12:18,256 --> 00:12:19,655
But...

101
00:12:19,725 --> 00:12:21,249
...don't worry, Zee.

102
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:24,352
I'm coming back for you.

103
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,691
Thought you'd be over with that Tebbs girl.

104
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:30,933
Maybe I oughta be.
She's awfully pretty, ain't she?

105
00:12:31,003 --> 00:12:32,527
If you think so.

106
00:12:33,005 --> 00:12:36,099
'Course, every fellow around here's
been to visit her.

107
00:12:36,975 --> 00:12:39,375
I don't guess you have
that problem, do you, Beth?

108
00:12:39,444 --> 00:12:41,605
I have just as many visitors as I want.

109
00:12:41,813 --> 00:12:44,748
- And you can count on it.
- Like who, for instance?

110
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,711
That's for me to know and you to find out.

111
00:12:48,487 --> 00:12:50,614
How am I supposed to find out
if you won't tell me?

112
00:12:50,689 --> 00:12:54,921
Jim Younger, there are some things
that a man does not ask a lady.

113
00:12:56,261 --> 00:12:59,958
When you're old enough to call
yourself a lady, I'll keep that in mind.

114
00:13:03,568 --> 00:13:07,004
Think maybe you oughta get married.
Is that what you want?

115
00:13:09,007 --> 00:13:12,670
Seems that you proposed to me
during the war about seven years ago.

116
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:14,306
That was different.

117
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,840
'Cept...

118
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,944
...I always knew that you were the one.

119
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,614
I just didn't have nothing
worked out, that's all.

120
00:13:25,223 --> 00:13:27,589
That's a mouthful, Mr. Jesse James.

121
00:13:28,326 --> 00:13:30,351
Well, it's a mouthful of truth.

122
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:34,531
Now, what you gotta decide is if
you want to get on the horse with me.

123
00:13:34,766 --> 00:13:38,862
Now, I'm gonna be honest about it, Zee.
I ain't gonna change the way I live.

124
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,430
Well...

125
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,268
...it ain't right to try to change a person.

126
00:13:47,946 --> 00:13:50,813
Truth is, Jesse, I wouldn't
like you any other way.

127
00:14:02,794 --> 00:14:05,991
Next thing you know,
they'll get married and settle down.

128
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,327
First part, anyway.

129
00:14:10,602 --> 00:14:12,194
He's asking her today.

130
00:14:17,242 --> 00:14:19,437
Doesn't go with the way he's living.

131
00:14:20,045 --> 00:14:21,376
He'll be fine.

132
00:14:23,014 --> 00:14:25,574
First gettin' shot, then gettin' married.

133
00:14:26,985 --> 00:14:28,612
Bad habits.

134
00:14:29,754 --> 00:14:31,915
I'd like to have a white dress...

135
00:14:32,557 --> 00:14:33,717
...and a proper weddin'.

136
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:35,692
Sounds like you want
the whole county there.

137
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,749
I do.

138
00:14:37,929 --> 00:14:40,397
A girl only gets married once, you know?

139
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,328
I never was the marrying kind myself.
Kind of life I lead, women just felt troubled.

140
00:15:20,405 --> 00:15:23,306
Footloose and fancy free, that's my style.

141
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,672
What about you, friend?

142
00:15:24,743 --> 00:15:26,904
I ain't felt the call yet, but...

143
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:29,574
...if I was to meet a gal
as nice and pretty as this one here...

144
00:15:29,648 --> 00:15:31,343
...I expect I could be persuaded.

145
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:34,544
I tell you something, Mister.
You best be watching your mouth...

146
00:15:34,619 --> 00:15:36,382
...and not looking at my wife here.

147
00:15:36,521 --> 00:15:37,749
Sorry.

148
00:15:38,256 --> 00:15:39,814
Didn't mean no disrespect.

149
00:15:39,891 --> 00:15:42,257
'Course he didn't. Just bein' polite.

150
00:15:42,327 --> 00:15:44,727
Hey, old man, put a cork in it a while.

151
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,361
Vernon, be polite.

152
00:16:10,755 --> 00:16:12,017
Goddamn outlaws.

153
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:14,684
Vernon, why don't you
just hand that over here?

154
00:16:14,859 --> 00:16:17,828
Damn. You son of a bitch,
you're in it with 'em.

155
00:16:25,036 --> 00:16:27,027
I would toss that shotgun away.

156
00:16:35,347 --> 00:16:36,974
Throw down the box.

157
00:16:52,097 --> 00:16:54,031
Any of you men fight
for the Stars and Bars?

158
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:55,726
Yes, sir. Proud of it.

159
00:16:56,234 --> 00:16:58,134
May I shake your hand?
Bob Younger.

160
00:16:58,236 --> 00:17:01,103
- George. George Arthur.
- Who were you with, George?

161
00:17:01,172 --> 00:17:02,662
General Joe Shelby.

162
00:17:03,775 --> 00:17:05,106
What about you?

163
00:17:05,443 --> 00:17:07,468
- I was with Shelby, too.
- Where?

164
00:17:08,246 --> 00:17:09,372
Coleharbor.

165
00:17:09,547 --> 00:17:13,039
Shelby weren't at Coleharbor.
You're a goddamned liar.

166
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:17,282
- Should I kill him?
- I would. I'd shoot the son of a bitch.

167
00:17:18,156 --> 00:17:21,182
Bob, I want you to take
everything he has. You hear?

168
00:17:21,293 --> 00:17:23,818
- Everything.
- Let me give you a hand.

169
00:17:23,895 --> 00:17:26,261
You're lucky you ain't dead,
you son of a bitch.

170
00:17:26,331 --> 00:17:28,629
Hope we didn't disturb
you too much, ma'am.

171
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:32,798
- Didn't mean you no harm.
- You scum! Take your hands off my wife.

172
00:17:33,772 --> 00:17:36,605
If you shut up,
maybe I won't put a bullet in you.

173
00:17:38,043 --> 00:17:42,309
Forgive me for saying so, ma'am but you
could've done better than Vernon here.

174
00:18:01,633 --> 00:18:04,193
I'll be goddamned and go to hell.

175
00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:13,471
"Jack of diamonds, jack of diamonds

176
00:18:13,545 --> 00:18:16,173
"I know you from old

177
00:18:16,348 --> 00:18:19,010
"You robbed my poor pockets

178
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:22,176
"Of silver and gold"

179
00:18:26,091 --> 00:18:29,254
- Most people knock.
- I expect they do.

180
00:18:45,844 --> 00:18:48,813
How many women you visited
before you come to see me?

181
00:18:50,949 --> 00:18:52,541
This is my first stop.

182
00:19:04,963 --> 00:19:06,430
Well, here I am.

183
00:19:13,571 --> 00:19:16,699
"I'll bring the blind by way they know not.

184
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:20,867
"I will lead them into paths
they have not known.

185
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:24,806
"I will make darkness
light before them and...

186
00:19:25,984 --> 00:19:28,384
"... I'll make crooked things straight. "

187
00:19:29,954 --> 00:19:32,616
Isaiah: 42:16.

188
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:36,427
"Poor drunkard, poor drunkard

189
00:19:36,494 --> 00:19:39,019
"How bad I do feel"

190
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,198
You and me seem to be
gettin' along real good.

191
00:19:44,335 --> 00:19:47,498
You might think about makin'
an honest woman out of me.

192
00:19:54,946 --> 00:19:57,642
- You're serious, aren't you?
- Don't I sound it?

193
00:19:58,149 --> 00:19:59,912
Well, then you gotta be crazy.

194
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,585
Just want to find out what it
feels like to be respectable.

195
00:20:06,024 --> 00:20:07,582
For a while, anyway.

196
00:20:09,561 --> 00:20:11,859
You'll never be respectable, Belle.

197
00:20:13,164 --> 00:20:14,529
You're a whore.

198
00:20:16,134 --> 00:20:17,863
You'll always be a whore.

199
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,030
It's why I like you.

200
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:29,337
Ready?

201
00:20:30,148 --> 00:20:31,274
One.

202
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:32,440
Two.

203
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,774
Three.

204
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,124
- How you been, Beth?
- Fine.

205
00:21:14,225 --> 00:21:17,490
Ain't you heard the news?
I'm engaged to Ed Miller.

206
00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:19,589
Ed Miller?

207
00:21:21,966 --> 00:21:23,490
He ain't no good.

208
00:21:24,636 --> 00:21:28,504
- Besides, you're too young for all that.
- I'm 19 on the 23rd of September.

209
00:21:28,573 --> 00:21:31,269
I don't want to wait around
forever like Zee did.

210
00:21:31,342 --> 00:21:33,105
I don't want you saying
nothing bad about Ed...

211
00:21:33,177 --> 00:21:35,145
...just 'cause Jesse picked on him.

212
00:21:36,648 --> 00:21:39,378
Wasn't but a few months ago
I was pushing you in a swing.

213
00:21:39,484 --> 00:21:43,716
Well, while you was pushing,
other people was noticing.

214
00:21:44,722 --> 00:21:46,349
I noticed you, Beth.

215
00:21:50,428 --> 00:21:52,794
You don't want to rush into things, Beth.

216
00:21:53,131 --> 00:21:54,826
You can't undo 'em later.

217
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:57,691
I can't undo this one.

218
00:21:57,802 --> 00:22:00,635
Ed's already bought land
over past Russellville.

219
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,064
'Sides, we told everybody.

220
00:22:06,044 --> 00:22:08,308
Well, ain't much else to say, I guess.

221
00:22:09,314 --> 00:22:11,145
You can wish me a good life.

222
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,312
I wish you that.

223
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:16,944
What you got to say for yourself, Jim?

224
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:18,681
Not much, Ed.

225
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,484
Be seeing you around.

226
00:22:33,438 --> 00:22:34,837
How you been, Ed?

227
00:22:35,773 --> 00:22:37,104
Oh, I'm fine.

228
00:22:38,109 --> 00:22:39,633
How you doin', Clell?

229
00:22:40,478 --> 00:22:42,207
Oh, I'm gettin' on pretty good.

230
00:22:44,649 --> 00:22:47,982
This is my girl here. This is Beth Mimms.

231
00:22:49,187 --> 00:22:50,814
We're gettin' married.

232
00:22:52,423 --> 00:22:54,653
I heard you two took up together.

233
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:56,927
It's good to see you, Beth.

234
00:23:00,264 --> 00:23:02,061
I'm doin' real fine, Clell.

235
00:23:03,868 --> 00:23:05,335
Don't miss you boys none.

236
00:23:12,243 --> 00:23:14,837
Come on, Beth.
Let's get to dancing here.

237
00:24:03,928 --> 00:24:05,293
You scared?

238
00:24:07,632 --> 00:24:10,328
Little bit. I expect I am.

239
00:24:11,803 --> 00:24:14,169
Just walk up to 'em real steady, though.

240
00:24:14,472 --> 00:24:16,099
We got nothin' to lose.

241
00:24:17,975 --> 00:24:21,467
Now you let me do the talking, Bob.
You got that?

242
00:24:23,247 --> 00:24:24,646
Say, do I look ok?

243
00:24:25,349 --> 00:24:27,180
You look fine, Charlie.

244
00:24:35,927 --> 00:24:37,758
You Frank James?

245
00:24:38,529 --> 00:24:40,053
Who wants to know?

246
00:24:40,231 --> 00:24:42,791
Charlie Ford, his little brother Bob.

247
00:24:43,634 --> 00:24:45,829
What the hell you boys doin' here?

248
00:24:46,871 --> 00:24:48,463
We want to join up.

249
00:24:48,706 --> 00:24:50,936
We heard you were lookin'
for some new men.

250
00:24:51,876 --> 00:24:53,844
Where'd you hear it from?

251
00:24:54,312 --> 00:24:55,904
Your brother.

252
00:24:58,015 --> 00:25:01,246
There ain't a horse we can't ride,
target we can't hit...

253
00:25:01,352 --> 00:25:03,547
...or bank we can't rob.

254
00:25:06,691 --> 00:25:10,058
You know how it is.
It was there. It seemed easy.

255
00:25:10,595 --> 00:25:13,189
Just hauled out our guns
and made off with it.

256
00:25:13,664 --> 00:25:15,757
Up in Joplin it was.

257
00:25:16,734 --> 00:25:19,066
They chased us for two days.

258
00:25:20,138 --> 00:25:23,335
You know how it is,
being out on the trail and all.

259
00:25:31,849 --> 00:25:34,943
We only been out once, but we're willing.

260
00:25:39,056 --> 00:25:41,251
What the hell were we talkin' about?

261
00:26:32,577 --> 00:26:34,101
Hey, Coleman Younger!

262
00:26:41,052 --> 00:26:43,213
Come on over here and say hello.

263
00:26:57,768 --> 00:26:58,928
Evenin', ma'am.

264
00:27:00,071 --> 00:27:03,472
Looks like everybody's havin'
a real good time at this affair.

265
00:27:05,409 --> 00:27:06,967
I expect so.

266
00:27:07,812 --> 00:27:09,939
Free drinks and food and all.

267
00:27:11,649 --> 00:27:13,173
How come I wasn't invited?

268
00:27:14,418 --> 00:27:15,908
'Cause you're a whore.

269
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:24,220
Yeah, well, at least I ain't a cheap one.

270
00:28:03,501 --> 00:28:05,935
- See you later, Jess.
- See you, Jim.

271
00:28:06,637 --> 00:28:08,127
- Bye.
- Bye, Zee.

272
00:28:13,411 --> 00:28:16,710
Ain't gonna be too long that'll
be you and me, eh, Beth?

273
00:28:17,515 --> 00:28:18,777
I reckon.

274
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,290
How are you?
I hear you bought a horse today.

275
00:28:32,663 --> 00:28:34,654
I got a question for you.

276
00:28:34,932 --> 00:28:36,957
Fire away, Frank.

277
00:28:37,201 --> 00:28:39,294
Fire away and fall back.

278
00:28:43,474 --> 00:28:44,907
You ever been in love?

279
00:28:46,811 --> 00:28:48,142
Oh, God.

280
00:28:48,612 --> 00:28:49,943
Yeah.

281
00:28:50,548 --> 00:28:51,742
It was terrible.

282
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:53,548
An affliction.

283
00:28:53,684 --> 00:28:56,847
Really miserable. Nothin' but trouble.

284
00:28:57,655 --> 00:28:59,520
Drove me crazy.

285
00:28:59,757 --> 00:29:00,951
That bad? Really?

286
00:29:01,659 --> 00:29:02,887
Yeah.

287
00:29:04,462 --> 00:29:06,089
She was wonderful.

288
00:30:31,482 --> 00:30:32,710
What the hell you aiming to do?

289
00:30:32,783 --> 00:30:34,978
I ain't aiming to do nothin'.
I'm doing it.

290
00:30:45,296 --> 00:30:48,857
- Who are you, Jesse James?
- Hell, no. I'm Bob Younger.

291
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:53,600
Jesse James rides with the Youngers.
Now stop the damn train.

292
00:30:59,243 --> 00:31:00,870
Don't worry, ladies and gentlemen.

293
00:31:00,945 --> 00:31:03,880
We're just taking a permanent loan
from the Rock Island payroll.

294
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:50,783
Pinkerton Company, in conjunction with
the Union Pacific Railroad...

295
00:31:50,861 --> 00:31:53,386
...is offering a reward of $5,000...

296
00:31:53,531 --> 00:31:57,991
...for information leading to the arrest of
any member of the James-Younger gang.

297
00:32:09,213 --> 00:32:11,238
- Mr. Rixley?
- That's right.

298
00:32:11,315 --> 00:32:13,545
I'm Carl Reddick.
New York Herald sent me out...

299
00:32:13,617 --> 00:32:15,744
...to cover the story
of the James-Younger gang.

300
00:32:15,819 --> 00:32:18,014
You might say I'm interested
in the same thing.

301
00:32:19,123 --> 00:32:21,853
What do you think your chances
are of bringing 'em in?

302
00:32:22,426 --> 00:32:24,553
That's an amazingly stupid question.

303
00:32:56,527 --> 00:32:58,154
I want your sons, Mrs. Samuel.

304
00:32:58,796 --> 00:33:01,856
- What do you want 'em for?
- For robbing banks and trains.

305
00:33:01,932 --> 00:33:05,459
Then you Yankees can just turn
around and head on back.

306
00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:07,899
Sounds like you got
the wrong James family.

307
00:33:08,138 --> 00:33:10,800
Yes, ma'am, I am a Yankee and a city man.

308
00:33:10,874 --> 00:33:13,069
But these men with me here,
they're southern.

309
00:33:13,244 --> 00:33:15,144
They rode with the Stars and Bars
during the struggle.

310
00:33:15,212 --> 00:33:17,772
What are they chasing my boys for then?

311
00:33:18,115 --> 00:33:19,742
Because they steal, ma'am.

312
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,845
I'm afraid I'll have to go
in there and look for 'em.

313
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,319
This paper here gives me
the right to do that.

314
00:33:30,628 --> 00:33:33,461
Things have come to a pretty place
when a widow woman...

315
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:35,930
...with a 15-year-old backward baby boy...

316
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,628
...gets treated like this,
and they call it legal!

317
00:33:39,303 --> 00:33:40,827
I am sorry, ma'am.

318
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:48,277
How come I never been asked?

319
00:33:49,546 --> 00:33:51,446
Maybe you ain't cut out for it.

320
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,775
We got enough hands the way it is.

321
00:33:54,985 --> 00:33:56,282
You keep me in mind.

322
00:33:56,353 --> 00:33:58,821
I can rob banks as good as them
Millers or your brother Bob.

323
00:33:58,889 --> 00:34:00,754
- Ain't nothin' to it.
- Think so?

324
00:34:00,858 --> 00:34:03,088
Shit, what's to know
about robbing a bank?

325
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,524
You ride into town like
thunder and cannonballs...

326
00:34:05,596 --> 00:34:08,565
...guns blazin', scaring the Jesus
out of everyone in sight...

327
00:34:08,632 --> 00:34:09,564
...until they're frozen.

328
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:11,897
Then you ride right
in the bank on your horse...

329
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:13,960
...you dynamite the safe
and ride off with the loot.

330
00:34:14,038 --> 00:34:16,598
Hootin' and hollerin'
same damn way as you came in.

331
00:34:17,408 --> 00:34:18,875
That right?

332
00:34:37,961 --> 00:34:39,588
Good afternoon.

333
00:34:40,064 --> 00:34:41,691
Afternoon.

334
00:34:45,536 --> 00:34:47,163
What's the trouble, friend?

335
00:34:49,073 --> 00:34:52,008
No trouble.
We're looking for the Youngers.

336
00:34:52,476 --> 00:34:53,909
You know them?

337
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,907
Sure I do.

338
00:34:58,415 --> 00:35:00,246
Lot of 'em around these parts.

339
00:35:00,818 --> 00:35:02,285
Big family.

340
00:35:03,721 --> 00:35:06,690
- Who are you fellas?
- Come here to buy cattle.

341
00:35:10,661 --> 00:35:12,094
This ain't Texas.

342
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:15,221
What about the Youngers?

343
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:17,823
You're lookin' at two of 'em.

344
00:35:18,202 --> 00:35:20,033
And you ain't here to buy cattle.

345
00:35:20,571 --> 00:35:22,163
Who are you fellas?

346
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,001
Goddamn Pinkertons!

347
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:29,909
- Which Younger are you?
- Question is who are you?

348
00:35:31,081 --> 00:35:32,105
I told you.

349
00:35:33,384 --> 00:35:35,978
- We're cattle buyers.
- How dumb you think we are?

350
00:35:36,053 --> 00:35:37,816
You're Pinkerton men!

351
00:35:38,188 --> 00:35:39,553
I'm Jim Younger.

352
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:43,986
This is my cousin John. You ain't lookin'
for him, he don't ride with us.

353
00:35:44,428 --> 00:35:46,259
Is that right?

354
00:36:27,037 --> 00:36:29,232
I told you he was my cousin.

355
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,964
He never rode with us once.

356
00:36:31,341 --> 00:36:34,242
Eighteen years old, and I gotta take
him back to his family dead.

357
00:36:34,445 --> 00:36:35,844
You broke the law.

358
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:02,163
People say they got one of the Youngers.

359
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,240
People say they got the wrong Younger.

360
00:37:20,624 --> 00:37:21,488
Stand back.

361
00:37:21,558 --> 00:37:24,322
All right, now everybody ready.
Wait for 'em to come out.

362
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:39,835
God.

363
00:37:51,355 --> 00:37:54,415
- What in the hell happened?
- I don't know.

364
00:37:54,658 --> 00:37:58,424
We put a smoker in the cabin.
All of a sudden it blew.

365
00:37:59,263 --> 00:38:02,357
The only thing we meant to do
was drive 'em out to us.

366
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,102
- Now, you're sure it was not a bomb?
- No. It wasn't no bomb.

367
00:38:08,472 --> 00:38:11,100
The old lady must've thrown
the smoker in the fireplace...

368
00:38:11,174 --> 00:38:14,735
...and the kerosene went up.
That's the only thing I can figure at.

369
00:38:15,212 --> 00:38:18,306
Killing a simple-minded 15-year-old boy.

370
00:38:19,082 --> 00:38:23,382
You men did excellent at making heroes
out of every one of those gentlemen.

371
00:39:50,841 --> 00:39:53,901
Archie Payton Samuel
was an innocent boy.

372
00:39:54,511 --> 00:39:58,504
It's a sad day when murder
is committed in the name of justice.

373
00:39:59,883 --> 00:40:03,114
This act tries the forbearance
of good Christian men.

374
00:40:04,488 --> 00:40:06,820
We commend this child's body
to the ground.

375
00:40:08,191 --> 00:40:10,716
His soul belongs to the Lord.

376
00:41:09,186 --> 00:41:10,380
Beth.

377
00:41:11,188 --> 00:41:12,212
Ed.

378
00:41:13,623 --> 00:41:14,851
Didn't bring no gun.

379
00:41:16,993 --> 00:41:19,427
I ain't got no quarrel with them Pinkertons.

380
00:41:21,398 --> 00:41:24,299
I'm sorry about what happened
to Archie, but...

381
00:41:25,268 --> 00:41:29,637
...since you boys kicked me out you can
just go ahead and fight your own fights.

382
00:41:30,607 --> 00:41:32,700
That how you feel about it, Beth?

383
00:41:36,847 --> 00:41:38,439
- No, it ain't.
- Come on, Beth.

384
00:41:38,515 --> 00:41:42,474
- I've had enough talkin' with this fella here.
- You go your own way.

385
00:41:44,354 --> 00:41:46,948
Now you hold it, woman.
You gotta learn to mind me.

386
00:41:47,023 --> 00:41:48,388
Hey, Ed...

387
00:41:49,926 --> 00:41:51,518
...start walkin'.

388
00:42:01,738 --> 00:42:03,603
Is that what you want, Beth?

389
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,845
Then to hell with you.

390
00:42:16,586 --> 00:42:18,349
To hell with both of you.

391
00:42:40,443 --> 00:42:43,970
Awful sorry about your little brother.
Sorry.

392
00:42:50,387 --> 00:42:51,445
Mama.

393
00:42:52,722 --> 00:42:54,121
Just rest now.

394
00:42:54,524 --> 00:42:57,584
We're gonna take you over
to Scofield's house directly.

395
00:42:59,663 --> 00:43:01,096
I'm sorry, ma.

396
00:43:02,232 --> 00:43:03,756
I'm so sorry.

397
00:43:06,703 --> 00:43:08,637
You gonna make 'em pay, Jesse?

398
00:44:03,126 --> 00:44:05,151
You got it wrong, Mister.
We didn't do nothin'.

399
00:44:05,228 --> 00:44:06,991
Yes, you did.

400
00:44:07,364 --> 00:44:10,663
Some of our friends saw you
on the north road that night.

401
00:44:11,902 --> 00:44:13,961
Please, Mister. It wasn't really a bomb.

402
00:44:14,037 --> 00:44:16,665
It was just supposed
to smoke everybody out.

403
00:44:21,511 --> 00:44:24,139
My little brother was 15 years old.

404
00:44:25,115 --> 00:44:27,208
Now, you think about that...

405
00:44:27,851 --> 00:44:29,512
...on your way to hell.

406
00:44:45,201 --> 00:44:48,728
The funeral will be in Chicago,
and the governor will be there.

407
00:44:48,872 --> 00:44:52,137
I'm sure it'll cheer their souls
just to hear you say that.

408
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:55,974
It'd cheer them to know how many men
we have out combing those hills.

409
00:44:56,579 --> 00:44:59,047
Those boys got a lot of friends out there.

410
00:45:33,016 --> 00:45:34,950
What are these two doing here?

411
00:45:35,418 --> 00:45:36,749
Visiting.

412
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,714
- You got a law against that?
- No, ma'am.

413
00:45:39,823 --> 00:45:43,384
I got a law against murder,
and I got a warrant right here.

414
00:45:43,593 --> 00:45:46,323
I don't suppose it'd do me any good
to ask polite, would it?

415
00:45:46,396 --> 00:45:48,864
It won't do you any good to ask at all.

416
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,230
These men of yours
are gonna end up dead...

417
00:45:52,369 --> 00:45:54,530
...or they're gonna end up worse.

418
00:45:54,904 --> 00:45:57,668
You ladies will be left all alone
just to think about it.

419
00:45:59,376 --> 00:46:00,400
Mr. Rowe!

420
00:46:01,644 --> 00:46:04,306
I want people in the house.
I want people in the woods.

421
00:46:04,381 --> 00:46:07,282
All right, men, off your horses.
Let's go.

422
00:46:42,685 --> 00:46:43,777
Morning, boys.

423
00:46:45,688 --> 00:46:46,780
Morning, Cole.

424
00:46:52,162 --> 00:46:54,653
You boys wasted the best part of the day.

425
00:46:54,864 --> 00:46:58,391
Hard to say y'all are farm bred,
the way you sleep in.

426
00:46:58,902 --> 00:47:00,961
What's for breakfast?

427
00:47:01,037 --> 00:47:03,028
Grits. Cracklin' grits.

428
00:47:03,673 --> 00:47:04,935
Had 'em yesterday.

429
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:11,202
- I'm sick of this damn hiding out.
- Who ain't?

430
00:47:11,514 --> 00:47:14,813
Better mind your manners, Bob
and thank McCorkindale here.

431
00:47:14,951 --> 00:47:16,976
Don't be picking on Bob, Jesse.

432
00:47:17,087 --> 00:47:19,817
- Hey, shut up, Jim.
- Shut up yourself, Frank.

433
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:23,323
I ain't got nothing but respect
for Mr. McCorkindale.

434
00:47:25,562 --> 00:47:28,463
You boys just got holdup fever.
I know it.

435
00:47:28,698 --> 00:47:30,928
All y'all need's a little fresh air.

436
00:47:31,768 --> 00:47:34,737
I'll get y'all some milk
soon as I feed the chickens.

437
00:48:14,811 --> 00:48:17,075
- What about McCorkindale?
- He's dead.

438
00:48:17,147 --> 00:48:19,047
- You sure?
- He's dead.

439
00:48:19,115 --> 00:48:20,207
Piss on you!

440
00:48:26,856 --> 00:48:28,756
Cover him, damn it!

441
00:48:53,449 --> 00:48:56,282
Next volley, we go.
Frank's hurt, he goes first.

442
00:50:26,542 --> 00:50:29,306
<i>"Jesus, my Lord</i>

443
00:50:29,512 --> 00:50:31,776
"To heaven is gone

444
00:50:31,981 --> 00:50:34,108
"Where there's no more

445
00:50:34,183 --> 00:50:37,209
"Stormy clouds arising

"His track I'll see and I'll pursue

450
00:50:56,539 --> 00:50:58,234
"Where there's no more... "

451
00:50:58,441 --> 00:51:00,636
What is your full name, Mrs. Samuel?

452
00:51:00,743 --> 00:51:03,007
My paper would like to get it right.

453
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:06,239
Zerelda Cole Samuel.

454
00:51:07,884 --> 00:51:10,819
My husband Robert James
died in California.

455
00:51:12,155 --> 00:51:14,385
My second husband
was called Ruben Samuel.

456
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:15,718
Ruben.

457
00:51:16,192 --> 00:51:18,888
And where did you and Mr. Samuel live?

458
00:51:20,096 --> 00:51:21,791
Clay County, Missouri.

459
00:51:22,665 --> 00:51:24,633
Are you the mother of Jesse James?

460
00:51:25,268 --> 00:51:26,565
I am.

461
00:51:27,036 --> 00:51:30,130
"His track I'll see

462
00:51:30,206 --> 00:51:32,697
"And I'll pursue

463
00:51:32,775 --> 00:51:36,768
"Where there's no more
stormy clouds arising... "

464
00:51:36,846 --> 00:51:40,111
Mrs. Samuel, you've already lost one son.

465
00:51:41,351 --> 00:51:43,546
Aren't you afraid your other
two boys are gonna end up...

466
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:45,587
...the same as McCorkindale there?

467
00:51:45,655 --> 00:51:49,682
"Where there's no more
stormy clouds arising"

468
00:52:02,105 --> 00:52:03,504
Ed, you identify the James boys...

469
00:52:03,573 --> 00:52:06,599
...and the Youngers,
might mean a reward for you.

470
00:52:08,911 --> 00:52:11,641
- How much?
- Couple thousand dollars.

471
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:16,083
Shit.

472
00:52:18,187 --> 00:52:20,121
I got a question for you.

473
00:52:21,457 --> 00:52:23,584
How do I identify
what you can't even catch?

474
00:52:23,659 --> 00:52:24,853
They are gonna get caught.

475
00:52:24,927 --> 00:52:27,054
Jesse and his boys are
done with you anyway.

476
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:29,758
Let me tell you one damn thing.

477
00:52:31,367 --> 00:52:35,303
I turn 'em in, and I'm gonna get killed
by one of their relatives, sure as hell.

478
00:52:35,405 --> 00:52:38,340
I got six months to go here
for busting up a place drunk...

479
00:52:38,408 --> 00:52:41,571
...so I'm just gonna take
my chances, all right?

480
00:52:42,612 --> 00:52:44,705
Besides, Jesse just
might change his mind...

481
00:52:44,814 --> 00:52:47,374
...and he pays better wages than you do...

482
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:49,345
...Pinkerton man.

483
00:52:53,656 --> 00:52:56,489
Frank, I never saw myself as a farm girl.

484
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:59,357
We ain't gonna be farming, Annie.
We're gonna raise horses.

485
00:52:59,429 --> 00:53:02,159
I don't know anything
about raising horses, either.

486
00:53:02,832 --> 00:53:04,993
You know, it's funny.
Outside of being a banker...

487
00:53:05,101 --> 00:53:08,229
...about the only thing I ever wanted to do
was to raise horses.

488
00:53:08,337 --> 00:53:11,534
Thanks to the Pinkertons,
you're getting your chance.

489
00:53:11,841 --> 00:53:12,830
Ha, mule!

490
00:53:13,142 --> 00:53:15,076
And we're not the only ones
going our own way.

491
00:53:15,144 --> 00:53:16,634
Everybody's doing it.

492
00:53:16,712 --> 00:53:20,705
Jim Younger's off in the hills somewhere.
God only knows where Jesse is.

493
00:53:20,783 --> 00:53:22,683
Bob and Cole are heading for Texas.

494
00:53:22,919 --> 00:53:25,114
The only reason why
Cole Younger went to Texas...

495
00:53:25,221 --> 00:53:28,281
...is 'cause he heard Belle Shirley
got married down there.

496
00:53:28,357 --> 00:53:30,882
It's a long way to go looking for trouble.

497
00:53:31,027 --> 00:53:32,756
He'll be just fine, Annie.

498
00:53:33,229 --> 00:53:35,390
Ha, mule! Yo!

499
00:53:35,932 --> 00:53:37,365
Ha, mule!

500
00:54:33,089 --> 00:54:34,147
You're late.

501
00:54:34,857 --> 00:54:37,325
I'm not much for being on time.

502
00:54:39,161 --> 00:54:40,788
You don't look real happy.

503
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:43,555
Well, I'll tell you something about Texas.

504
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,231
It's loud.

505
00:54:45,701 --> 00:54:48,602
I never figured you for the homesick type.

506
00:54:49,105 --> 00:54:53,098
I ain't the homesick type.
I ain't the waiting-around type either.

507
00:54:53,409 --> 00:54:55,536
I ain't the reliable type.

508
00:54:56,078 --> 00:54:58,342
You ought to try getting married.

509
00:54:59,115 --> 00:55:01,310
Might improve your character.

510
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:03,441
What do you do with that...

511
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:06,784
...husband of yours,
leave him home, tied to the bed?

512
00:55:07,023 --> 00:55:09,253
Don't you make no fun of him.

513
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,593
The way I got it figured,
you're gonna wear that Indian out.

514
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:16,755
Double-thump side swoop of yours.

515
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:20,992
I do what I want with who I want,
and don't make no mistake about it.

516
00:55:21,103 --> 00:55:23,503
Everybody says that.
They always have.

517
00:55:26,542 --> 00:55:28,669
You want to see something,
you watch this.

518
00:55:29,545 --> 00:55:31,069
Come here.

519
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:40,355
- You done?
- Not by a damn sight.

520
00:55:56,038 --> 00:55:57,471
Now you're done.

521
00:56:05,081 --> 00:56:06,275
Sam.

522
00:56:08,084 --> 00:56:09,711
You Cole Younger?

523
00:56:10,419 --> 00:56:11,750
Who's asking?

524
00:56:12,221 --> 00:56:13,620
Sam Starr.

525
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:15,848
I'm married to that lady.

526
00:56:17,493 --> 00:56:19,085
Pleased to meet you.

527
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:24,797
Boys, there is no need
to fight over little old me.

528
00:56:25,301 --> 00:56:28,429
But if you've got to,
you make it man-to-man.

529
00:56:31,173 --> 00:56:32,731
Hand-to-hand.

530
00:56:36,946 --> 00:56:38,174
Why not?

531
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,188
I'm glad I caught you in a good mood.

532
00:57:06,042 --> 00:57:07,532
Here you go, both of you.

533
00:57:08,544 --> 00:57:09,977
Have a chew.

534
00:57:11,147 --> 00:57:12,637
What does the winner get?

535
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:15,479
Nothing you both ain't already had.

536
00:57:19,055 --> 00:57:21,080
Don't make much sense, does it?

537
00:57:22,558 --> 00:57:23,616
Nope.

538
00:57:23,693 --> 00:57:25,456
You're both crazy.

539
00:57:26,495 --> 00:57:28,554
But you keep me occupied.

540
00:57:30,166 --> 00:57:32,896
I am having a real good time.

541
00:57:36,772 --> 00:57:39,240
Ten bucks on the half-breed, right here.

542
00:59:20,376 --> 00:59:21,968
Get off of me!

543
00:59:22,311 --> 00:59:23,710
Come on, Missouri.

544
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:22,497
What's the matter?

545
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:29,505
You got what you wanted.

546
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:00,934
Sir, we met a few months back.

547
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:02,342
I remember.

548
01:01:02,411 --> 01:01:06,643
I'd like to ask you a couple of questions
for my newspaper if you don't mind.

549
01:01:06,882 --> 01:01:10,909
Like why you're having so much trouble
bringing in the James-Younger gang.

550
01:01:12,087 --> 01:01:13,520
A lot of reasons.

551
01:01:13,722 --> 01:01:16,122
Came down here with four men
that didn't know the territory.

552
01:01:16,191 --> 01:01:17,624
They were murdered.

553
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:20,420
Most the people around here
are related to each other...

554
01:01:20,529 --> 01:01:21,655
...so they're very clannish.

555
01:01:21,797 --> 01:01:23,389
What about the local police?

556
01:01:23,666 --> 01:01:27,363
Local police get tired and quit
after chasing the gang a couple of miles.

557
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:30,932
There are also newspapers like your own
that print lies about the gang...

558
01:01:31,006 --> 01:01:34,169
...saying they're Robin Hoods.
That doesn't help either.

559
01:01:34,376 --> 01:01:36,105
My readers may want to know
why you're sitting...

560
01:01:36,178 --> 01:01:40,171
...here next to this warm, friendly fire
when you should be out on the chase.

561
01:01:40,349 --> 01:01:43,341
Right now the whole bunch of them
are spread out across five states.

562
01:01:43,585 --> 01:01:45,314
But they will be back.

563
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:37,136
Zee, did you have any visitors
while I was gone?

564
01:02:37,439 --> 01:02:40,431
Do you mean was there
anybody poking around...

565
01:02:40,509 --> 01:02:43,205
...trying to straighten up your
sheets and fluff your pillow?

566
01:02:43,312 --> 01:02:44,609
I'm just asking.

567
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:47,478
Why don't you just mind your
manners, Mr. Jesse James?

568
01:02:47,549 --> 01:02:49,414
Just 'cause you're off
fighting railroads and banks...

569
01:02:49,485 --> 01:02:52,818
...don't mean you get a free
tongue around this house.

570
01:02:54,423 --> 01:02:58,291
I sent out a word to the rest.
Gonna be meeting up real soon.

571
01:02:59,495 --> 01:03:01,087
Going on a mission.

572
01:03:03,799 --> 01:03:06,165
I'm gonna get myself a little cash.

573
01:03:08,337 --> 01:03:12,467
Start looking around this here state
of Missouri for some girl to marry.

574
01:03:13,842 --> 01:03:15,469
Any prospects?

575
01:03:17,379 --> 01:03:18,505
I'm looking.

576
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:33,894
I don't know, Annie.

577
01:03:34,396 --> 01:03:37,229
Maybe we're just going
in different directions.

578
01:03:38,567 --> 01:03:39,932
Maybe so.

579
01:03:40,169 --> 01:03:42,569
Can't help wanting what we want, can we?

580
01:03:49,178 --> 01:03:51,646
My going's got nothing
to do with big dreams.

581
01:03:51,747 --> 01:03:55,183
Nobody ever made you go anywhere
you didn't want to go, Frank.

582
01:04:00,556 --> 01:04:01,682
Good night.

583
01:04:21,076 --> 01:04:23,510
- How you doin', Jim?
- I'm doin', okay.

584
01:04:32,955 --> 01:04:37,289
So, gents. Let's get down to it.
What's our next job gonna be?

585
01:04:40,028 --> 01:04:41,427
Minnesota.

586
01:04:41,697 --> 01:04:45,497
Them squareheads,
they got 'em a real fat bank up there.

587
01:04:46,668 --> 01:04:48,397
Scouted it out myself.

588
01:04:49,538 --> 01:04:51,096
Northfield.

589
01:04:52,875 --> 01:04:57,335
A lot of banks and cat houses
in Missouri we ain't done.

590
01:04:59,548 --> 01:05:01,015
Cole's right.

591
01:05:01,416 --> 01:05:02,906
Minnesota...

592
01:05:03,452 --> 01:05:05,647
...it's a fair piece off our mark.

593
01:05:05,888 --> 01:05:08,857
Clell says that bank's
full to the brim with money.

594
01:05:09,258 --> 01:05:10,850
It sounds good to me.

595
01:05:14,429 --> 01:05:17,421
I want Bill Chadwell
and Charlie Pitts to go with us.

596
01:05:17,633 --> 01:05:19,157
They're goddamn good men.

597
01:05:20,369 --> 01:05:21,495
Who says?

598
01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:23,301
I do.

599
01:06:18,293 --> 01:06:20,625
I used to do this all the time.

600
01:06:21,830 --> 01:06:23,229
But I...

601
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:27,832
...I got married a few years back.

602
01:06:29,137 --> 01:06:31,628
I guess it slowed me down a bit.

603
01:06:32,641 --> 01:06:34,233
If you know what I mean.

604
01:06:59,835 --> 01:07:01,029
Morning, Jess.

605
01:07:06,908 --> 01:07:09,433
I hope you boys had a good time last night.

606
01:07:09,711 --> 01:07:11,338
How was yours?

607
01:07:12,714 --> 01:07:14,807
I got better things to think about.

608
01:07:18,687 --> 01:07:20,211
Family man.

609
01:07:22,457 --> 01:07:25,824
My family is something you don't
talk about, Cole Younger.

610
01:08:07,369 --> 01:08:10,236
"Well, I walked the street
with a tap to my feet

611
01:08:10,305 --> 01:08:12,671
"Heard a voice above me

612
01:08:12,841 --> 01:08:17,676
"A maid looked out the window up above
needed somebody to love me

613
01:08:17,779 --> 01:08:22,648
"My father, he's a minister
and virgins he doth cherish

614
01:08:22,718 --> 01:08:27,678
"Now she's got five boys, seven little girls
and a baby on her shoulder"

615
01:08:37,399 --> 01:08:38,798
You know, Frank...

616
01:08:39,868 --> 01:08:43,065
...when this is all over,
I think I'll write me a book.

617
01:08:43,138 --> 01:08:45,868
Make myself even more famous than I am.

618
01:08:47,442 --> 01:08:49,842
If a pig had wings, it would fly.

619
01:08:52,447 --> 01:08:54,438
A book about my exploits...

620
01:08:55,384 --> 01:08:57,352
...as a gentleman and a lover.

621
01:08:59,621 --> 01:09:01,282
I expect a free copy.

622
01:09:01,490 --> 01:09:02,787
Free copy?

623
01:09:06,027 --> 01:09:07,654
You gotta pay, Frank.

624
01:09:08,830 --> 01:09:10,092
You gotta pay.

625
01:09:12,334 --> 01:09:14,302
You ever been up North before?

626
01:09:15,137 --> 01:09:17,105
Got to Fetterman once.

627
01:09:17,606 --> 01:09:19,267
Went to shoot buffalo.

628
01:09:19,441 --> 01:09:20,669
How'd you do?

629
01:09:21,143 --> 01:09:25,102
The price of hides went to hell,
and I got the clap off some squaw.

630
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,566
The bank's plumb in the center of town.

631
01:10:20,702 --> 01:10:23,865
Right between the dry goods store
and the mortuary.

632
01:10:24,539 --> 01:10:28,407
You reckon we ought to send in
a couple of scouts? Check it all out?

633
01:10:28,477 --> 01:10:31,241
We rob banks, Jim.
We don't need any checking.

634
01:10:31,413 --> 01:10:34,610
Talking soft I might expect
from Cole or Frank.

635
01:10:35,951 --> 01:10:39,079
I gave up trying to talk sense
to you a long time ago.

636
01:10:48,597 --> 01:10:50,724
Come on, let's take the damn bank.

637
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:54,293
There ain't nothin' over there
but squareheads anyhow.

638
01:14:03,024 --> 01:14:05,356
All right, you people, nobody move.

639
01:14:06,428 --> 01:14:08,794
Let's just show God
the palms of our hands.

640
01:14:08,863 --> 01:14:11,263
Now you don't give us no trouble, Mister.

641
01:14:11,499 --> 01:14:13,057
Clell, get to the vault.

642
01:14:22,110 --> 01:14:25,443
No, he's not for sale.
Just move on, squarehead.

643
01:14:32,187 --> 01:14:35,452
Now you open that safe
or I'll blow your head right off.

644
01:14:35,690 --> 01:14:37,681
I can't, it's a time lock.

645
01:14:40,361 --> 01:14:43,228
- What are you talking about?
- Time lock, hell.

646
01:14:43,465 --> 01:14:46,093
You open that safe, Mister, you hear?

647
01:14:46,801 --> 01:14:48,894
The Pinkertons told us
you might be coming.

648
01:14:49,504 --> 01:14:52,803
The lock is set just for you.
It only works at 4:30.

649
01:14:54,042 --> 01:14:55,509
The whole town is ready.

650
01:15:07,388 --> 01:15:11,119
No, no, mister, please don't shoot.
I have a family.

651
01:15:11,459 --> 01:15:14,485
Now you got five seconds
to open up that vault, mister.

652
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:21,259
What the hell? Get out of here.

653
01:15:30,145 --> 01:15:31,612
Be quiet, lady!

654
01:15:36,885 --> 01:15:38,375
They're robbing the bank!

655
01:15:38,453 --> 01:15:39,647
Jesus, Clell!

656
01:15:39,754 --> 01:15:43,019
They're robbing the bank!
They're robbing the bank!

657
01:16:06,581 --> 01:16:09,573
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- Come on, Clell.

658
01:16:25,767 --> 01:16:28,201
- Clell, come on!
- Yankee bastard.

659
01:16:35,043 --> 01:16:36,567
Jim!

660
01:16:37,612 --> 01:16:38,636
Bob!

661
01:20:11,692 --> 01:20:12,886
Cole!

662
01:20:13,428 --> 01:20:14,656
Jesse!

663
01:20:15,363 --> 01:20:17,354
Oh, God!

664
01:20:17,698 --> 01:20:19,188
Cole!

665
01:22:28,729 --> 01:22:30,492
We gotta move, Frank.

666
01:22:31,933 --> 01:22:34,094
They'll get the rest of 'em to a doctor.

667
01:22:36,671 --> 01:22:37,831
Who will?

668
01:22:38,005 --> 01:22:39,973
The posse that's gonna be chasing us.

669
01:22:41,309 --> 01:22:44,574
We can't do that.
We can't just leave 'em here alone.

670
01:22:59,594 --> 01:23:00,686
Jim.

671
01:23:01,429 --> 01:23:02,555
Cole.

672
01:23:05,166 --> 01:23:06,690
We gotta ride.

673
01:23:10,504 --> 01:23:11,766
What about the rest?

674
01:23:11,839 --> 01:23:14,273
This just ain't no time
to argue with you, Cole.

675
01:23:17,178 --> 01:23:20,079
Either you stay here and die,
or you come with us.

676
01:23:21,749 --> 01:23:23,478
Frank and I are going.

677
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:52,703
Kill me.

678
01:23:53,781 --> 01:23:55,578
Goddamn it. Kill me.

679
01:23:55,716 --> 01:23:56,978
Frank?

680
01:24:02,223 --> 01:24:04,054
You're not leaving, are you?

681
01:24:08,629 --> 01:24:10,859
I gotta stick with my brother, Cole.

682
01:24:32,353 --> 01:24:34,321
The Youngers don't need you.

683
01:25:16,831 --> 01:25:18,924
I like it better this way, Jesse.

684
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:22,292
I get to see you run.

685
01:26:05,613 --> 01:26:07,740
Jim? Oh, Cole.

686
01:26:08,616 --> 01:26:10,277
Yeah, we're here, Bobby boy.

687
01:26:11,218 --> 01:26:12,685
We're all here.

688
01:26:14,188 --> 01:26:17,282
Goddamned squareheads.

689
01:26:38,946 --> 01:26:41,107
Where the hell's Missouri?

690
01:28:08,802 --> 01:28:10,429
Come on, Frank.

691
01:28:11,472 --> 01:28:15,033
We're gonna get us a new gang together.
It's gonna be better than ever.

692
01:28:15,409 --> 01:28:17,502
You're not gonna quit on me now.

693
01:28:20,714 --> 01:28:25,481
All we got to do is get across the river.
All we got to do is get home.

694
01:28:28,622 --> 01:28:30,556
We never should have left.

695
01:29:15,469 --> 01:29:17,334
You could say we was drove to it.

696
01:29:20,674 --> 01:29:22,141
How's that?

697
01:29:23,077 --> 01:29:26,444
If it weren't for the war,
we might have been something else.

698
01:29:28,616 --> 01:29:30,743
You're a little too young
to have fought in the war.

699
01:29:30,818 --> 01:29:35,312
That's true, but my brothers weren't.
And we all go one direction together.

700
01:29:35,556 --> 01:29:38,423
You tell me who they are,
it might mean a lighter sentence.

701
01:29:38,492 --> 01:29:39,754
You think about that.

702
01:29:39,893 --> 01:29:42,555
You and I both know it was
the James boys, don't we?

703
01:29:43,664 --> 01:29:45,461
Sure do feel poorly.

704
01:29:47,134 --> 01:29:50,433
Ain't a surprise. Eleven bullets
must be some kind of record.

705
01:29:51,372 --> 01:29:53,567
What do you and your brothers
think about a life sentence?

706
01:29:53,674 --> 01:29:56,700
You're lucky they don't allow
hanging in this state.

707
01:29:57,578 --> 01:30:00,638
Come on, Cole.
Tell me what you think about all this.

708
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:08,281
Hell, we played a rough game.

709
01:30:08,722 --> 01:30:09,780
We lost.

710
01:30:11,992 --> 01:30:13,926
I spent four years in the army.

711
01:30:14,728 --> 01:30:16,719
Eleven trying to get out of it.

712
01:30:17,665 --> 01:30:19,758
What about the James boys?

713
01:30:22,236 --> 01:30:25,171
- I don't know nothing about 'em.
- Sure you do.

714
01:30:27,041 --> 01:30:29,942
Far as I'm concerned,
they never been in this state.

715
01:30:43,624 --> 01:30:45,182
You another reporter?

716
01:30:46,226 --> 01:30:49,957
No. My name is Jacob Rixley.
I'm with the Pinkerton agency.

717
01:30:50,197 --> 01:30:52,665
I've been chasing you boys
for a long time, Bob.

718
01:30:53,333 --> 01:30:55,130
Yes, sir, I guess you have.

719
01:30:55,903 --> 01:30:58,201
I want to talk to you
about the James boys.

720
01:30:58,572 --> 01:31:01,040
You don't owe them a thing.
You know that, don't you?

721
01:31:01,108 --> 01:31:04,202
They wouldn't protect you if
it'd get them one day less.

722
01:31:04,945 --> 01:31:06,708
But unless you help me...

723
01:31:07,481 --> 01:31:11,042
...you and your brothers
are going to be in this jail for life.

724
01:31:16,123 --> 01:31:18,023
What's he trying to say?

725
01:31:19,293 --> 01:31:22,785
He said to tell you we done it
for Dixie and nothin' else.

726
01:31:25,165 --> 01:31:26,860
15,000 for Jesse.

727
01:31:27,568 --> 01:31:29,866
Another 10,000 will get you Frank.

728
01:31:32,072 --> 01:31:35,439
The Pinkerton company and
the governor can't afford that.

729
01:31:35,709 --> 01:31:37,404
You know who you're talking to?

730
01:31:37,778 --> 01:31:40,042
You know what kind of a man
sprung out of Missouri?

731
01:31:40,114 --> 01:31:42,878
The Jameses, Youngers, Clantons, Earps.

732
01:31:43,317 --> 01:31:45,376
And now Bob and Charlie Ford.

733
01:31:45,452 --> 01:31:48,444
Word's out you and Jesse
aren't even friends anyway.

734
01:31:48,789 --> 01:31:50,017
Is that so?

735
01:31:50,090 --> 01:31:53,253
That same Mr. Jesse James
you can't find at all...

736
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:55,726
...just asked us to come and visit him.

737
01:31:58,398 --> 01:31:59,990
Let's go, Bob.

738
01:32:01,168 --> 01:32:02,430
Wait a minute.

739
01:32:03,303 --> 01:32:04,634
$15,000.

740
01:32:05,973 --> 01:32:07,964
Half before and half when it's done.

741
01:32:09,143 --> 01:32:10,701
Got yourself a deal.

742
01:32:16,917 --> 01:32:18,680
No more for me.

743
01:32:21,822 --> 01:32:24,484
Heard you were thinking
of a bank in Kansas, Jesse.

744
01:32:25,692 --> 01:32:28,160
We don't talk business at the table, Bob.

745
01:32:29,630 --> 01:32:30,858
Sorry.

746
01:32:36,069 --> 01:32:38,003
How'd you boys like a drink?

747
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:39,762
Sounds good.

748
01:32:40,674 --> 01:32:42,232
Don't it, Bob?

749
01:32:42,442 --> 01:32:43,909
Sure thing.

750
01:32:44,778 --> 01:32:47,008
Could I have your plate, please, Jesse?

751
01:32:51,451 --> 01:32:52,782
Charlie.

752
01:33:03,897 --> 01:33:07,492
- You feelin' all right?
- She ain't real fond of the company.

753
01:33:10,704 --> 01:33:12,763
Don't worry none, ladies.

754
01:33:13,173 --> 01:33:15,437
Just talking some things over, that's all.

755
01:33:24,985 --> 01:33:26,680
Can you say, "good night"?

756
01:33:36,463 --> 01:33:40,194
He might be carryin' a hideout.
I bet he is.

757
01:33:41,235 --> 01:33:42,600
He knows.

758
01:33:43,103 --> 01:33:45,230
I know he knows.

759
01:33:50,410 --> 01:33:52,139
Pour me one, Bob.

760
01:33:56,783 --> 01:33:58,774
You look spooked, Charlie.

761
01:33:59,953 --> 01:34:01,318
Like hell.

762
01:34:02,289 --> 01:34:04,814
Nothing spooks me, Jesse.
You know that.

763
01:34:09,496 --> 01:34:12,294
Now, I been thinking about
the Platte City bank.

764
01:34:12,633 --> 01:34:14,032
It's gonna be a big one.

765
01:34:14,735 --> 01:34:16,498
We ain't too sure.

766
01:34:17,504 --> 01:34:19,802
- Why not?
- I don't know.

767
01:34:20,507 --> 01:34:22,998
You're a hard man to do business with.

768
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:28,411
It's crooked.

769
01:34:29,316 --> 01:34:30,715
What did you say?

770
01:34:31,752 --> 01:34:33,743
Said it's not straight.

771
01:34:39,726 --> 01:34:41,887
I really like this old sampler.

772
01:34:42,195 --> 01:34:44,390
Ma gave this to me for my wedding day.

773
01:34:48,802 --> 01:34:50,429
Is that straight?

774
01:34:51,405 --> 01:34:53,635
I shot Jesse James.

775
01:35:00,347 --> 01:35:02,645
- Mr. Rixley?
- That's right.

776
01:35:04,251 --> 01:35:06,151
My name is Frank James.

777
01:35:09,022 --> 01:35:11,149
I came here to turn myself in.

778
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:14,725
Here's my gun.

779
01:35:16,430 --> 01:35:18,227
I want something in return.

780
01:35:20,267 --> 01:35:22,758
I want to be able to bury my brother.

781
01:35:24,705 --> 01:35:26,900
Suppose I don't agree to your terms?

782
01:35:28,942 --> 01:35:30,534
I'll kill you.

783
01:37:35,635 --> 01:37:38,263
"Jesse James, we understand

784
01:37:38,371 --> 01:37:40,271
"Has killed a many man

785
01:37:40,740 --> 01:37:44,471
