1
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:32,658
Left, right, left, left, left...

2
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,002
Over here.

3
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,049
Everybody out of the truck.

4
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:47,264
Over to the ammo dump.
Get the hell going in a hurry.

5
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:56,732
Casper, come on with me.

6
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:01,691
Hey, Fred, can you help me
get this stuff unloaded?

7
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,777
Get that damn thing up here.

8
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:11,781
I read they're looking for
professionals in Africa.

9
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:13,075
What – whores?

10
00:01:13,075 --> 00:01:15,412
No, mercenaries, sarge.

11
00:01:15,412 --> 00:01:17,411
Mexico and Latin America, too.

12
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,251
Mercs are getting 1300 a month
plus transportation.

13
00:01:20,251 --> 00:01:24,213
They want combat soldiers,
Casper, not typists.

14
00:01:24,213 --> 00:01:27,925
I was told to report to you, sergeant.
I'm Hardin.

15
00:01:27,925 --> 00:01:32,511
Rifleman Charles Hardin, Corporal.
Where're you from, Charlie?

16
00:01:32,511 --> 00:01:34,136
El Paso.

17
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:36,013
Is that right? Tell me how
you like being

18
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:38,308
in the Louisiana National Guard
all of a sudden.

19
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:39,352
I don't.

20
00:01:39,352 --> 00:01:42,689
But then I didn't much like being
in the Texas Guard either.

21
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:45,276
Well, not liking the Texas Guard
makes sense.

22
00:01:45,276 --> 00:01:48,900
Not liking the Louisiana Guard
can get you into trouble with me.

23
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,239
You got that?

24
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,737
Got it.

25
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:55,827
You get your butt on over to
2nd squad – you'll recon with them.

26
00:01:55,827 --> 00:01:58,327
Casper, show him the way.

27
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:00,873
Introduce him to the boys.

28
00:02:00,873 --> 00:02:02,794
Right.

29
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:18,973
Cease fire!

30
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,102
We sure get all the good details
around here.

31
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:27,817
It'll be good exercise for you, Simms.
Put a little muscle in your pants.

32
00:02:27,817 --> 00:02:30,153
It's the last thing I need, coach.

33
00:02:30,153 --> 00:02:32,027
Unless you want to take care of it?

34
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,528
Listen, Stuckey.

35
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,699
Maybe I'll just bend you in half
so you can take care of it yourself.

36
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:37,787
Easy, big fella!

37
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:45,877
Listen, Stuckey. I like a joke just like
anybody, but I don't like that one.

38
00:02:45,877 --> 00:02:49,339
- Come on, now.
- Ah! I'm with you coach.

39
00:02:49,339 --> 00:02:51,675
Speaking for myself, I like women.

40
00:02:51,675 --> 00:02:53,924
Yeah, we won't be seeing
many of them.

41
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:57,971
- Life's full of surprises.
- What does that mean?

42
00:02:57,971 --> 00:03:01,140
I've arranged for a little treat
for the weekend, boys.

43
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,559
Six whores de combat
awaiting our assault.

44
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:05,936
I'm sure they'll fuck us
in a more interesting way

45
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,688
than the Louisiana National Guard.

46
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,901
- You ain't kidding, right?
- I never joke about women.

47
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:12,488
Women? What women?

48
00:03:12,488 --> 00:03:15,074
Got some hookers at the end
of the line, coach.

49
00:03:15,074 --> 00:03:18,040
- You mean prostitutes?
- Exactly what I mean.

50
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,411
This is new low, Spencer,
even for you.

51
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,420
I got 'em scheduled to meet us
just outside of Catahoula.

52
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,919
Gotta be there about the time
we emerge from the...

53
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,546
great primordial swamp.

54
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,467
- Got one for me?
- Me?

55
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:37,761
You mean us, don't you, brother?
What's happening here?

56
00:03:37,761 --> 00:03:39,974
The purpose of the National Guard

57
00:03:39,974 --> 00:03:42,559
is to keep you darker brothers away
from decent Southern women.

58
00:03:42,559 --> 00:03:44,433
- Man!
- However...

59
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:48,562
in the spirit of the New South,
I have made full arrangements.

60
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,402
What about you, Hardin?

61
00:03:50,402 --> 00:03:54,901
I got a wife. You can count me out
of this one.

62
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,573
I suppose you're used to a more
serious soldiering over in El Paso?

63
00:03:58,573 --> 00:04:00,824
We had things organized over there.

64
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:04,828
Watch a ball game on TV,
shoot dice and sleep.

65
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,792
Louisiana Guard is a little different.

66
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:09,253
They have us out doing really
important things like...

67
00:04:09,253 --> 00:04:11,920
beating up on college kids and
tear gassing niggers.

68
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,590
Please, Mr. Guardsman,
no more canisters.

69
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,634
Don't set the shepherd dogs on me.

70
00:04:17,634 --> 00:04:19,678
See what I mean?

71
00:04:19,678 --> 00:04:22,554
We have a long, noble
military tradition.

72
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:25,148
- Hey, Casper!
- Huh?

73
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:37,195
Cut it out, Stuckey. Act like a soldier,
you damn dumb son of a bitch.

74
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,787
In the real world do you do
something useful

75
00:04:44,787 --> 00:04:47,456
or are you like the rest of the men
in the 2nd squad?

76
00:04:47,456 --> 00:04:50,500
I work for Petramco.
Chemical engineer.

77
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,001
College man.

78
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,841
They're kind of rare in Texas,
aren't they?

79
00:04:55,841 --> 00:04:59,134
Oh, we manage to come up with
one every now and then.

80
00:04:59,134 --> 00:05:01,428
You know, one might get
the impression

81
00:05:01,428 --> 00:05:04,805
you don't enjoy an occasional chat
with your fellow guardsmen.

82
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,394
Guess what? You're right.

83
00:05:06,394 --> 00:05:09,267
I can't say as I blame you
here and there.

84
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,896
Reece is under the impression most
of the time that he's in a dime novel

85
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,441
and Stuckey...

86
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:17,067
He isn't smart enough
to read a dime novel.

87
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:21,282
- The coach, well...
- Yeah, I think I know the type.

88
00:05:21,282 --> 00:05:24,032
Look, these guys are OK.

89
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:27,410
They just wanna have a little fun
with you being the new boy an' all.

90
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,832
They're not OK. They're just
Louisiana versions

91
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:33,835
of the same dumb rednecks
I've been around my whole life.

92
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:39,052
Hup! Hup, two, three, four!
Come on boys!

93
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:44,094
When I was training in Fort Polk
once our instructor got bit...

94
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,471
right here, by a coral snake.

95
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:50,350
Just put his hand on a log and took
his machete out and just...

96
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,521
cut it right off, took it right off.

97
00:05:52,521 --> 00:05:56,110
- Horseshit!
- Bullshit!

98
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:00,110
I swear it's the truth. Just fuck you!
I don't give a shit. Believe it or not.

99
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,905
For those of you who are interested,

100
00:06:01,905 --> 00:06:04,074
we are going on an overnight
recon and patrol.

101
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:06,493
Hush up and listen up!

102
00:06:06,493 --> 00:06:12,333
We've been designated Bravo, that
is Bravo Team, recon and security.

103
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:16,878
Rendezvous point Charlie, that is
Charlie, is just outside Catahoula.

104
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:19,172
We're gonna travel in file formation

105
00:06:19,172 --> 00:06:22,299
with maximum use of cover
and concealment.

106
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,095
We are traveling to make time.

107
00:06:24,095 --> 00:06:27,971
No tents, no sleeping bags.
Ponchos and liners only.

108
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,892
We're gonna have all kinds
of weather out there.

109
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:33,018
Sun, rain, cold in the morning.

110
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,983
Get used to this idea –
you're going in the water

111
00:06:35,983 --> 00:06:38,525
and that water's going to be cold.
Cribbs!

112
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:40,363
You with us?

113
00:06:40,363 --> 00:06:43,698
Oh, sure I am, sarge.
I'm really up for this.

114
00:06:43,698 --> 00:06:46,159
Well, that's good 'cuz you're going to
be my pace man.

115
00:06:47,826 --> 00:06:50,163
Reece, you'll be point.

116
00:06:50,163 --> 00:06:51,705
Yo!

117
00:06:51,705 --> 00:06:54,124
We're talking about 38km.

118
00:06:54,124 --> 00:06:57,500
You make sure your canteens are
filled at the water buffalo.

119
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,878
Each and every member
does their job.

120
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:02,174
I don't want nobody
dogging it out there.

121
00:07:02,174 --> 00:07:06,344
You're all buddies. You're counting
and depending on each other.

122
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:08,389
Everybody does their job.

123
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:12,891
Now please, for once in your life,
try to look like soldiers.

124
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,518
Civilian in peace, soldier in war.

125
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,021
I am the Guard.

126
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,695
That's right. Try to remember that.

127
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,335
Looks like somebody built
a whole new ocean here.

128
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,049
We are supposed to be
at this coordinate.

129
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:13,717
Either this map is wrong

130
00:11:13,717 --> 00:11:16,764
or all of a sudden I can't find my way
around the block.

131
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,540
The channel must have shifted
with the winter rains.

132
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,414
What's supposed to be land
is underwater.

133
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,292
- D'you want me to raise company?
- No, there's no need for that.

134
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:53,757
It's real simple. Either we can get
across going down this point of land

135
00:11:53,757 --> 00:11:55,595
and it don't look good,

136
00:11:55,595 --> 00:11:58,890
we go all the way back
and start over.

137
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,105
Over here!

138
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,252
Damn!

139
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,304
Somebody shot Rudolph.

140
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,970
Who do you think these canoes
belong to?

141
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,014
Us.

142
00:12:42,014 --> 00:12:43,807
They belong to indigenous
personnel.

143
00:12:43,807 --> 00:12:45,600
Don't you be fucking
around with them.

144
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,394
Think they float?

145
00:12:47,394 --> 00:12:51,940
Hell yes. They're pirogues. Cajuns
back there use them all the time.

146
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,112
Well, they ain't using them now.

147
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,738
What say we take 'em down
the bayou?

148
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:04,035
Yeah, I can deal with that,
the way my back feels.

149
00:13:04,035 --> 00:13:07,537
We might make Catahoula tonight.
Put them women under martial law.

150
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,038
What women you talking about?

151
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,916
Spencer's running some ladies.

152
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,510
He's got some skirts waiting for us.

153
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:19,216
It's all set. Noleen and
her bayou queens.

154
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:21,303
Just a little something for morale.

155
00:13:21,303 --> 00:13:22,515
Really?

156
00:13:22,515 --> 00:13:26,099
Let me add, sergeant, that these
women are expecting some...

157
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:28,145
small unit military penetration.

158
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,024
I don't think we should take
the canoes. They're not ours.

159
00:13:34,024 --> 00:13:37,275
That's right, they're not ours.

160
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:40,074
Let's get in 'em and take off.

161
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,200
Hold on, fungo.
Nobody gave you an order.

162
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,371
How else are we gonna get there?

163
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,914
Maybe you got a point there, Reece.

164
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:51,960
Hell yes, let's move.

165
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,625
Wait a minute, Reece.

166
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,878
How are the rightful owners
gonna get those boats back

167
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:59,255
when there's no other access
to the far shore?

168
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,175
Hell, we only need three of them.

169
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:03,051
They can use the other ones
to get 'em back.

170
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:06,347
A little R & R never hurts.
Catahoula, here we come.

171
00:14:06,347 --> 00:14:07,689
What d'you say, sarge?

172
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:22,615
OK. Bowden, write 'em a note.

173
00:14:22,615 --> 00:14:25,411
- Yes, sir.

174
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,669
All right, get those steel pots off,
hook 'em on your belts.

175
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:39,761
Shape up now.

176
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,929
Shape up, Stuckey.

177
00:14:43,929 --> 00:14:46,470
Get in the goddamn boat
and look like soldiers.

178
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,142
Come on, Bowden.

179
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:50,890
Get that oar.

180
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,369
Hey! Look over there.

181
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:09,102
There they are.
These must be their canoes.

182
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:17,894
Hey there, you men! Read the note!
We left you a note.

183
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,690
Dumb coon asses.

184
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,277
They don't understand.

185
00:16:23,277 --> 00:16:25,694
I hope they find my note.

186
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:27,489
Maybe they only speak French.

187
00:16:27,489 --> 00:16:29,989
Well, does anybody speak French?

188
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:34,706
Yeah. Voulez-vous fuck me?

189
00:16:34,706 --> 00:16:38,667
Reece, knock that shit off.
We're bringing them back.

190
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:40,835
We're bringing them back.

191
00:16:40,835 --> 00:16:44,007
Let 'em have it.
Take no prisoners.

192
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,976
Stuckey! Asshole!

193
00:16:54,976 --> 00:16:58,897
Casper, get your boat over
to that point of land now.

194
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,919
Sarge!

195
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:23,043
Poole! Poole!

196
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,812
Get outta here.

197
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,522
Get outta here, Bowden.
What the fuck?

198
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,713
Hit it! Take cover.

199
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,135
They shot him! They shot him!

200
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,101
Spencer, over here. Over this way.

201
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,474
Jesus Christ, what's happenin'?

202
00:18:18,474 --> 00:18:20,725
Are they still shooting?
Where are they?

203
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,523
I don't know. I can't see 'em.

204
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,190
Hey, get down, man.

205
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,859
Poole. We gotta get Poole.

206
00:18:27,859 --> 00:18:30,701
You take care of it. I'm gonna go
over there and look out for 'em.

207
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,119
Come on.

208
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,374
Come on, let's go.

209
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,468
He fell over there.

210
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,158
Let's set him down.

211
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,530
Goddamn you, Stuckey.

212
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,458
Over here, come on.

213
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,459
Come on, watch out.

214
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,486
No sign of them.

215
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,985
Where the hell's that damn map?

216
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,156
He was holding it. I remember.

217
00:19:57,156 --> 00:20:00,533
Damn! Compass is gone.

218
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:01,784
How'd that happen?

219
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:04,378
It was in the water.
What the hell d'you think?

220
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:07,709
And guess who put it there.

221
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:11,210
That's right, Bowden. What the hell
d'you tip us over for?

222
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,088
Didn't tip the canoes over.
You started it. It's your fault.

223
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:17,341
The hell you talkin' about?
You fucking panicked, you asshole!

224
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,637
I'll show you panic,
you little fucking redneck.

225
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,313
I didn't panic.

226
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:30,355
I didn't panic, you piss-ass!

227
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:39,989
What the hell is this shit?
Look, we're all soldiering together.

228
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,577
Damn it. You two guys shake hands.

229
00:20:42,577 --> 00:20:43,747
All right.

230
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,331
OK.

231
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,208
OK, good.

232
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,253
Simms, where's your radio?

233
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:55,215
In the water. Where d'you think?

234
00:20:55,215 --> 00:20:57,008
You're supposed to be
in charge of it.

235
00:20:57,008 --> 00:20:58,802
What the hell's the matter
with you?

236
00:20:58,802 --> 00:21:03,804
Look, we have a dead man here.
Now what are we gonna do?

237
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,768
Let's go get them cocksuckers
who shot Poole.

238
00:21:05,768 --> 00:21:08,060
I'll decide where we're going
and when.

239
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,810
Let's haul ass.

240
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,437
What about Sergeant Poole?

241
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,982
I say we leave him
unless you wanna carry him.

242
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:15,526
He's an American soldier.

243
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:19,028
He's got a Bronze Star, a Purple
Heart, a Vietnam Service Medal.

244
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:20,323
We're not leaving him here.

245
00:21:20,323 --> 00:21:23,242
The quicker we get outta here, the
quicker they can come back for him.

246
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:26,205
We're gonna follow through with our
mission. That's our responsibility.

247
00:21:26,205 --> 00:21:28,122
Come on, Casper. Let's get going.

248
00:21:28,122 --> 00:21:30,584
No, goddamnit!
We're not leaving him here.

249
00:21:30,584 --> 00:21:32,458
- Who says?
- I say,

250
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,710
I've got the stripes, I'm in charge

251
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,088
and I don't wanna hear
any more shit about it.

252
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,761
Now, let's just go.

253
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,951
Stuckey, you were one dumb son of
a bitch firing that machine gun.

254
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:08,996
Yeah, Stuckey.
Nobody gave you an order to fire.

255
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:12,790
Look, it was only a goddamn joke.
They were only blanks.

256
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,041
Forget it.

257
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:19,507
Forget it'? Shit! This moron gets
somebody killed – you say forget it?

258
00:22:19,507 --> 00:22:21,468
I got something for you boys
to remember.

259
00:22:21,468 --> 00:22:23,386
Stuckey wasn't the one
that shot Poole.

260
00:22:23,386 --> 00:22:26,011
The big thing is that after we get
Poole back to headquarters

261
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,389
we come back and
get these Cajuns.

262
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:32,103
Oh hell yes! All we got to do is
swim a couple a hundred yards

263
00:22:32,103 --> 00:22:33,941
and then find 'em back in that forest.

264
00:22:33,941 --> 00:22:37,486
After we done that we can capture
'em and shoot 'em with our blanks.

265
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:51,120
Well, what d'you think?
This bayou forks to the east.

266
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,622
Easiest to get where we want
moving that way.

267
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,792
We want to be heading north.
The interstate's north.

268
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,086
We're going to the interstate.

269
00:22:57,086 --> 00:22:58,923
Not if you go east.
The interstate's north.

270
00:22:58,923 --> 00:23:00,840
Fuck you, Spencer.
What the fuck you know?

271
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,676
I know there's a big fireball in the
sky that usually rises in the east

272
00:23:03,676 --> 00:23:05,050
and we're walking right into it.

273
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,140
- You gotta go east to go north.
- Yeah, right.

274
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,976
Who wants to run that by me one
more time? We got to go where?

275
00:23:09,976 --> 00:23:13,100
Can somebody figure out where
the hell we're goin' and do it quick?

276
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,520
Hardin, shut up.

277
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,188
It's my responsibility and
we're goin' east to get north.

278
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:18,652
Go ahead and do
what you want, zip.

279
00:23:18,652 --> 00:23:21,275
Exactly what the hell
I'm gonna do, Spencer.

280
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,744
Now let's move your asses.
Come on.

281
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,083
Turkey.

282
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:25,216
Turkey meat, turkey skin,
cracker meal, turkey fat, salt.

283
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,896
Smokes made it through
the water, huh?

284
00:24:36,896 --> 00:24:40,692
Yeah, I saved a pack. Lucky, huh?

285
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:45,401
Maybe it's about time
we divide up the bullets.

286
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:48,116
- What bullets?
- Reece has got some ammo.

287
00:24:48,116 --> 00:24:51,953
He always brings some along just
in case he runs into any big game.

288
00:24:51,953 --> 00:24:55,874
Back at bivouac he was showing off
a box full of 556s.

289
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,502
Hey, what the hell is this
anyway, man?

290
00:24:59,502 --> 00:25:02,544
Some kind of military secret
or something?

291
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:03,883
No way.

292
00:25:03,883 --> 00:25:07,381
I brought along one box of shells
for my own use.

293
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:09,508
Right now I'm locked and
loaded down

294
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,053
in case I meet up with them
sons of bitches that shot Poole.

295
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:13,472
Let me see your weapon, Reece.

296
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:16,267
You just stay on back.

297
00:25:16,267 --> 00:25:19,186
You give me the ammo. We're going
to divide them up evenly.

298
00:25:19,186 --> 00:25:21,730
- We'll share 'em.
- Bullshit.

299
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,819
It's mine and that's it.

300
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:27,987
It's not right, Reece. Give him
the bullets. It's a military situation.

301
00:25:27,987 --> 00:25:32,740
I'm giving you a direct order, Reece.
You give them to me.

302
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:36,955
You come one step closer, Casper,
and I'll give you something else.

303
00:25:36,955 --> 00:25:39,671
It's a court martial offense, man.

304
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:44,043
If you give me the ammo
we'll drop it right here.

305
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:46,420
Otherwise I'm going to
turn your ass in.

306
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,922
I don't give a shit what you s...

307
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,892
Quit fucking around and
give him your rifle.

308
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,390
Now.

309
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,709
I'll take Hardin's and
give them to him.

310
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,263
Here's your ammo.

311
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:37,271
Blade to the throat, huh?

312
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,229
That how they do
these things in El Paso?

313
00:26:41,229 --> 00:26:45,690
Yeah. That's how they do things
where I grew up.

314
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:48,406
Thought you were some kind
of chemical engineer.

315
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,820
I am and I'm out of the habit of
spending time

316
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,163
with a bunch of gun-toting rednecks.

317
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:57,533
Well, you know how it is.

318
00:26:57,533 --> 00:27:01,036
Down here in Louisiana when we
don't carry guns we carry ropes.

319
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:06,543
RC Colas, MoonPies. We're not too
smart but we have a real good time.

320
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,146
What're you doin', Cribbs?

321
00:27:23,146 --> 00:27:26,395
Say, man, I'm on sentry.
You wanna get some of this stuff?

322
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:28,065
How can you smoke that crap?

323
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:29,778
I ain't on your team, coach.

324
00:27:29,778 --> 00:27:32,651
Goddamn right, you're not.
You couldn't make the squad.

325
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,364
That stuff kills your will to win.

326
00:27:34,364 --> 00:27:35,704
How your boys do this year?

327
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:41,203
This was a rebuilding year.
We had injuries to key personnel.

328
00:27:41,203 --> 00:27:44,955
We finished three and seven.
What do you do for a living anyway?

329
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:47,126
I pick up a little cash
pimping here and there

330
00:27:47,126 --> 00:27:51,003
but most of what I turn over is from
selling dope to high school kids.

331
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,173
You're goddamn lucky
I don't believe you.

332
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:54,261
No, it's true.

333
00:27:54,261 --> 00:27:56,595
Some of my best customers
are at Fremont High

334
00:27:56,595 --> 00:27:58,468
and they were ten and 0 this year.

335
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,095
Coach.

336
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:03,190
I don't have to listen to this bullshit.

337
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,271
- Hey, Lonnie.
- Huh.

338
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:11,319
When are we going to kick his boy's
ass all the way back to El Paso?

339
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:15,944
Soon as we get up
to the rendezvous

340
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:20,245
then we're going to come back for
these coon asses that got Poole.

341
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,707
Lonnie...

342
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,423
Do you think this whole thing
was my fault?

343
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,377
Don't worry about it.

344
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,466
It's done.

345
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,223
Hey!

346
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,056
How can you guys play cards

347
00:28:40,056 --> 00:28:42,267
with Sergeant Poole lying dead
over there?

348
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:45,352
You got another idea about
what we should be doing?

349
00:28:45,352 --> 00:28:47,394
Just don't seem right.

350
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:49,438
Poole doesn't care – he's dead.

351
00:28:49,438 --> 00:28:52,189
I don't know what the hell any of us
can do about it

352
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:53,611
so why not play cards?

353
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:57,528
Just don't seem right.

354
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,163
- It's up this way.
- Where?

355
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,632
- Over there.
- OK, come on, keep moving.

356
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:25,056
Hey, Spencer, what about
Company Command?

357
00:29:25,056 --> 00:29:27,307
They should be wondering about us,
don't you think?

358
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,396
No, not yet.

359
00:29:28,396 --> 00:29:30,269
We've been out of contact
for 12 hours.

360
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,483
He's right. They should be looking
for us by now.

361
00:29:32,483 --> 00:29:34,818
No way. It's National Guard,
remember?

362
00:29:34,818 --> 00:29:37,067
We were supposed to meet
the trucks 20 minutes ago.

363
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:39,738
Another hour and a half
the trucks will actually show up.

364
00:29:39,738 --> 00:29:42,407
Two o'clock they'll start asking
around if anyone's seen us.

365
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:44,576
At three they'll start checking
the bars.

366
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,245
By four they'll really get steamed.

367
00:29:46,245 --> 00:29:48,914
By five it'll occur to someone
that maybe we got lost.

368
00:29:48,914 --> 00:29:51,083
At six the captain will consider
calling Battalion.

369
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:53,709
At seven-thirty he will.
Battalion will tell him it's too late –

370
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,757
there's nothing anyone can do
till morning.

371
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,724
There's the cabin.

372
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:16,273
It's him, that son of a bitch.

373
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:18,318
Where's the others?
There's more of them.

374
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:19,943
As far as I can tell he's alone.

375
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,864
- We'll capture him.
- What for? I can get him from here.

376
00:30:22,864 --> 00:30:23,908
Look, Reece,

377
00:30:23,908 --> 00:30:26,951
this is Louisiana National Guard,
not the goddamn vigilantes.

378
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:28,998
Let's move our asses.
Come on, let's go.

379
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:47,679
All right, look.
Here's the program.

380
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,894
We found one of the Cajuns
that shot Poole.

381
00:30:49,894 --> 00:30:53,186
We're gonna capture him.
He's up about 250 meters up ahead.

382
00:30:53,186 --> 00:30:55,025
You sure he's one of them?

383
00:30:55,025 --> 00:30:58,273
Of course we're sure.
What the hell do you think?

384
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,818
Why don't you try talking to him

385
00:30:59,818 --> 00:31:01,780
before you start blowing
his head off?

386
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:04,279
Simms, Reece, Stuckey and I
are the advance unit.

387
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,281
The initial action's
gotta be decisive.

388
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,746
- Surprise is the key.
- Hey, Casper.

389
00:31:08,746 --> 00:31:11,581
- Did you hear what I said?
- I heard you.

390
00:31:11,581 --> 00:31:13,455
We'll talk to him after
we've captured him.

391
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:15,000
The rest of you guys are
rear element,

392
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,463
you stay 100 meters back
and keep down.

393
00:31:17,463 --> 00:31:20,506
We'll marry up after the objective's
sealed off. Let's go.

394
00:31:20,506 --> 00:31:23,801
Wait. I'll volunteer for
the advance party.

395
00:31:23,801 --> 00:31:26,268
Forget it. Just do what the hell
you're told. Let's go.

396
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:01,588
Jesus! This is bullshit.

397
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:03,714
That's just what I was thinking.

398
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:07,805
Do you always get out
of everything?

399
00:32:07,805 --> 00:32:10,429
I don't see you raising your hand
to volunteer.

400
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:11,555
That's right.

401
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:14,183
I'm not gonna ride shotgun
with these dumbbells.

402
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,106
Four of them with automatic rifles
against some swamp rat.

403
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:21,948
I make it even money.

404
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,932
What are you doing, coach?

405
00:32:52,932 --> 00:32:54,602
Shut up.

406
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,155
Whoa!

407
00:33:05,155 --> 00:33:09,075
What in the hell...? Let's go.
Son of a bitch!

408
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,955
You're under arrest.

409
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:20,790
Bowden, get the hell away
from that prisoner.

410
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,130
I told you to stay in our back.

411
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,840
- Mission accomplished, sergeant.
- Ah, bullshit!

412
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,557
You used your real bullets.
Just pissed them away.

413
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:35,933
- I didn't panic.
- Oh hell!

414
00:33:35,933 --> 00:33:40,060
All right. Easy now.
We've got to interrogate him.

415
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,607
- Hey! (Speaks French)
- Surrender.

416
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:46,319
- Drop the knife.
- (Speaks French)

417
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:48,785
You son of a bitch.
I said drop the goddamn knife.

418
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,078
(Speaks French)

419
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,122
(Speaks French)

420
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:03,501
Son of a bitch! You could have
busted his jaw.

421
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:05,796
- That's right.
- We want him to talk.

422
00:34:05,796 --> 00:34:09,047
You almost knocked his mouth
down to his ass.

423
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,637
Jesus Christ, Simms.
We gotta interrogate the man.

424
00:34:11,637 --> 00:34:14,304
How the hell's he going to talk to us
if you break his fucking jaw?

425
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:16,891
- That's his fucking problem.
- What the hell did you do that for?

426
00:34:16,891 --> 00:34:18,765
That son of a bitch shot
Sergeant Poole.

427
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:22,941
Oh fuck him. Come on, Lonnie.
Let's go see what's inside.

428
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:35,784
Can you talk?

429
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:37,122
Ma bouche.

430
00:34:37,122 --> 00:34:40,413
Where's your buddies?
How many of them are there?

431
00:34:40,413 --> 00:34:42,210
Mange-merde.

432
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,586
What the shit is that?

433
00:34:45,586 --> 00:34:49,179
This Cajun got himself a couple
of mink this morning.

434
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,600
Goddamn!

435
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:57,139
This boy's a poacher.

436
00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:00,765
We poached the poachers!
Hey, Lonnie!

437
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,688
Yeah, he shined his last gator.

438
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,856
What the hell's going on here,
Casper?

439
00:35:06,856 --> 00:35:08,448
We got ourselves a prisoner.

440
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:14,198
Congratulations.

441
00:35:14,198 --> 00:35:16,659
Think you guys have done
a wonderful job.

442
00:35:16,659 --> 00:35:18,954
Hey, did you have to
cut his arm off too?

443
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:27,088
I'd say he uses dynamite to kill fish.

444
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,503
We got us a genuine outlaw.

445
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:33,757
Casper! All kinds of good shit
in here.

446
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:38,183
Simms, I don't want you
hitting him again.

447
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:47,188
You're the one that belted him?

448
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:48,689
Goddamn right.

449
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,567
What d'you want to go and
do that for?

450
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,363
I don't know.
Just got pissed.

451
00:35:55,363 --> 00:35:58,114
What the hell, man? This army
bullshit is getting to you.

452
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:03,456
Beans, hominy, spinach.
Hell, this is better than C-rations.

453
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:06,624
Guns, knives, ammo, supplies.

454
00:36:06,624 --> 00:36:08,750
We got it all right here.

455
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:12,839
I'd say we conducted ourselves
a pretty successful little raid.

456
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:14,508
We can pack this shit up later.

457
00:36:14,508 --> 00:36:16,884
Let's get outside and
interrogate the prisoner.

458
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:23,936
Cribbs.

459
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,852
- Yeah.
- Tie up the prisoner.

460
00:36:25,852 --> 00:36:27,189
How am I supposed to tie up a man

461
00:36:27,189 --> 00:36:28,899
when he only has one arm
to do the tying?

462
00:36:28,899 --> 00:36:30,815
Maybe we ought to try
talking to him first.

463
00:36:30,815 --> 00:36:32,111
You speak English?

464
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,360
Does anybody here speak French?

465
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,906
Bowden?

466
00:36:37,906 --> 00:36:39,326
Yeah.

467
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,706
Hey, what's wrong with you, coach?

468
00:36:44,706 --> 00:36:46,373
Don't bother me.

469
00:36:46,373 --> 00:36:48,465
Not now, not ever.

470
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:04,850
I'll give it a try. A couple of years of
parlez-vous in high school.

471
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:06,268
Ah...

472
00:37:06,268 --> 00:37:09,481
Hier quelqu'un...

473
00:37:09,481 --> 00:37:12,523
Shit! I can't remember
how to say "shoot".

474
00:37:12,523 --> 00:37:14,195
How about "bang bang"?

475
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:19,487
Hier, quelqu'un...

476
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:22,115
Bang une ami.

477
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:26,455
Mon pas fait rien. Mon dis toil

478
00:37:26,455 --> 00:37:28,874
I think he's saying
he didn't do anything.

479
00:37:28,874 --> 00:37:31,711
Hell, I don't know. It doesn't sound
like any French I ever studied.

480
00:37:31,711 --> 00:37:34,003
What the hell is this? I saw him.

481
00:37:34,003 --> 00:37:36,254
I was there too and
I couldn't swear to nothing.

482
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,675
Can't even remember
if the man had one arm.

483
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:41,768
He was more than 100 yards away,
remember.

484
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,528
We're gonna take this prisoner
back with us

485
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,280
to Staff Command for interrogation.

486
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,076
Then he can stand trial.

487
00:38:04,076 --> 00:38:07,369
Right now I want everybody over to
the rain barrel, fill your canteens.

488
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:09,291
I want to put some miles
between us and here.

489
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,561
Lonnie!

490
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:44,949
Bowden, you dummy.
There's dynamite in there.

491
00:38:47,576 --> 00:38:48,914
- Christ!
- Hit it!

492
00:38:48,914 --> 00:38:50,753
- Get down!
- Take cover!

493
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:52,640
That'll teach them to fuck with us.

494
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,063
Yeah, right. Can't argue with that.

495
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,774
What are you doing, Bowden?

496
00:39:57,774 --> 00:40:00,190
Went and blew the shit
out of everything.

497
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,816
Well, I do what I do.

498
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,864
What d'you paint the cross
on your chest for?

499
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:08,324
It's part of the joke.

500
00:40:08,324 --> 00:40:09,699
What joke?

501
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:12,369
It's a corporal joke, private.

502
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:14,083
Oh, what the hell, Bowden.

503
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:17,206
You dumb son of a bitch. You blown
up all the supplies we've captured.

504
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,833
All the guns, the ammo
and the food.

505
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:21,836
Casper, there comes a time
you have to abandon principles

506
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:22,928
and do what's right.

507
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:30,015
Maybe we'd better find
the interstate.

508
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:40,273
Let's get going, Casper.

509
00:40:40,273 --> 00:40:42,899
I think your little raid's
about finished.

510
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:46,949
Yeah, right. All right, men.
Let's move out.

511
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,380
Get on!

512
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,669
That dumb shit Bowden.

513
00:41:42,669 --> 00:41:46,546
Demolitioned that damn shack,
we lost everything we captured.

514
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:48,385
Yeah, could have worked as a signal

515
00:41:48,385 --> 00:41:50,846
for this bastard's relatives
to gather round.

516
00:41:50,846 --> 00:41:54,138
You don't think we've got to worry
about these coon asses, do you?

517
00:41:54,138 --> 00:41:55,638
Hell yeah.

518
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:59,142
But I know who's got to worry
about a lot more than me and you.

519
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:02,237
You don't have to tell me.

520
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:06,569
They think you boys are bad luck.

521
00:42:06,569 --> 00:42:08,406
They might be right.

522
00:42:08,406 --> 00:42:13,248
I been hanging round niggers my
whole life, I haven't got a break yet.

523
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,791
Listen, fellas.

524
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,166
I'm sorry about that incident
back there.

525
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:24,043
Guess I was a little...
over emotional.

526
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:26,961
Yeah, you could say that.

527
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,551
You could also say you were
totally out of control.

528
00:42:29,551 --> 00:42:33,011
I'm sorry, but I admired
Sergeant Poole a great deal.

529
00:42:33,011 --> 00:42:34,761
I liked him a lot.

530
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:38,857
I hope that that'll excuse my...
excessive behavior.

531
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,100
Sure.

532
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,274
Say, coach?

533
00:42:44,274 --> 00:42:46,441
At the risk of a punch in the mouth...

534
00:42:46,441 --> 00:42:48,783
Don't worry about that, Hardin.

535
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:54,572
Why d'you paint the cross
on your chest?

536
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:58,202
You know the avenging angel
and all that?

537
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,462
I thought at least you might
get it, Spencer.

538
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,632
Sorry to disappoint you, coach.

539
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:15,264
If you'll excuse me, I think I should
apologize to the rest of the men.

540
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,773
I got news for you.

541
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,193
He's nuts.

542
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:31,234
I mean really fuckin' nuts.

543
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:34,158
This is not exactly news
to the rest of us.

544
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:37,240
Is that all you've got to say?

545
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,660
After that whole number he pulled
back there?

546
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,373
What am I supposed to say?

547
00:43:41,373 --> 00:43:43,414
He's a dumb son of a bitch.

548
00:43:43,414 --> 00:43:46,252
He's real emotional,
he got pissed off.

549
00:43:46,252 --> 00:43:48,589
He got pissed off.

550
00:43:48,589 --> 00:43:52,049
So he paints himself red,
laughs like a fucking maniac

551
00:43:52,049 --> 00:43:54,549
and blows off like a volcano.

552
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:55,844
What if he is crazy?

553
00:43:55,844 --> 00:43:57,638
What do you want me
to do about it?

554
00:43:57,638 --> 00:44:00,479
Put him in a cage? Shoot him?

555
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,184
Either one sounds OK to me.

556
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:10,648
Any chance we're ever going to
get outta here?

557
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,150
You damn right we are.

558
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:14,824
Figure two hours tops
we hit the I-10.

559
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,253
Jesus!

560
00:44:31,253 --> 00:44:33,048
What the hell's this supposed
to mean?

561
00:44:33,048 --> 00:44:36,048
Don't mean nothin'.
Just some dude drying the skins.

562
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,050
It's a funny way of
stretching the skin.

563
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,018
You sure they weren't left for us?

564
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,645
There's eight of them.

565
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:50,940
So what?

566
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,815
There's eight of us.

567
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,612
What about this shit? Hmm?

568
00:44:55,612 --> 00:44:57,737
You know what it means?

569
00:44:57,737 --> 00:44:59,238
Lapin.

570
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:01,203
Come on, let's keep going.

571
00:45:01,203 --> 00:45:04,419
Wouldn't do any good here
no matter why they were left.

572
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:29,645
Goddamn it, Casper,
where's the highway?

573
00:45:29,645 --> 00:45:31,020
It's been hours.

574
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,941
It'll be right up ahead here.
It can't be too far.

575
00:45:33,941 --> 00:45:36,279
Yeah, right. Used to run right
through here.

576
00:45:36,279 --> 00:45:38,277
Those ecology boys must have
moved it.

577
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,575
Oh, fuck you, Spencer.

578
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:05,263
All right, hold up.
Everybody take five.

579
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:07,139
We'll go get a bearing.

580
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,310
With what? We don't have
a compass, remember?

581
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:12,147
You hear of taking a reading
off the sun, Spencer?

582
00:46:12,147 --> 00:46:14,522
Sure. Rises in the east,
sets in the west.

583
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:17,236
Interstate's north. If you ask me,
that's not where we're headed

584
00:46:17,236 --> 00:46:18,906
so why don't you go read
the sun, Casper?

585
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:23,156
That's exactly what I'm
gonna do, thanks.

586
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:30,414
Say, man, this cat know
what he doin'?

587
00:46:30,414 --> 00:46:31,664
What do you think?

588
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:34,166
Then why the hell are we
following him?

589
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,838
He's got stripes. That's why.

590
00:46:36,838 --> 00:46:40,464
Some of you boys outta remember
that this is a military operation.

591
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,559
Coming from you, Reece,
that's real classic.

592
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,233
Hey...

593
00:46:55,233 --> 00:46:56,731
What the hell was that?

594
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:58,324
Dogs, man. What d'you think?

595
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:00,987
It's hunting dogs.

596
00:47:00,987 --> 00:47:03,237
Hunting dogs mean hunters.

597
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,327
They can show us
the way outta here.

598
00:47:05,327 --> 00:47:07,869
Getting close.

599
00:47:07,869 --> 00:47:11,164
Yeah. Great!

600
00:47:11,164 --> 00:47:14,462
Hey, Casper!
We got some huntin' boys nearby.

601
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,296
They can show us the way
outta here, Casper.

602
00:47:19,296 --> 00:47:21,263
They can show us the way out.

603
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,361
Lonnie!

604
00:47:40,361 --> 00:47:41,698
Agh!

605
00:47:41,698 --> 00:47:44,662
Lonnie.

606
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,123
Goddamn!

607
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:51,079
Agh!

608
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:52,916
Son of a bitch!

609
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:46,592
Goddamn.

610
00:48:46,592 --> 00:48:49,093
Goddamn, he got me.

611
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:51,562
- Agh! My arm!
- Goddamn bastards!

612
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:56,853
- Cribbs, you all right?
- He got my arm.

613
00:48:56,853 --> 00:48:59,896
- Hardin! How bad is he? OK?
- I think so. Shit!

614
00:48:59,896 --> 00:49:01,609
- Spencer?
- Yeah.

615
00:49:01,609 --> 00:49:03,320
- Reece?
- Sons of bitches!

616
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:06,318
Goddamn sick setting
their goddamn dogs on us.

617
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:09,490
How can they do that? They set their
goddamn dogs on us.

618
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:13,410
- Reece, Lonnie, knock it off.
- Hey, they weren't his dogs.

619
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:15,998
Whose side are you on anyway?

620
00:49:15,998 --> 00:49:17,585
I ain't on yours, Reece, that's for...

621
00:49:17,585 --> 00:49:21,959
Knock it off! All of you, knock it off.

622
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,883
It's just what the enemy wants –
a fight among ourselves.

623
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:32,554
Now damn it, everybody just take
five and pull yourselves together.

624
00:49:32,554 --> 00:49:34,806
And you go cool off.

625
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:39,026
- Come on, man.
- Come on.

626
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:47,660
Spencer?

627
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:51,786
Yeah.

628
00:49:51,786 --> 00:49:55,452
I wanna know what the fuck's
going on here.

629
00:49:55,452 --> 00:49:57,041
I don't get you.

630
00:49:57,041 --> 00:50:00,333
Well, I'll make it real simple.

631
00:50:00,333 --> 00:50:03,002
My company transfers me
to Baton Rouge,

632
00:50:03,002 --> 00:50:05,377
been down here about six months.

633
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:08,756
I don't know a goddamn thing about
the swamps of Louisiana.

634
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:12,053
I get sent on some bullshit military
exercise, and all of a sudden,

635
00:50:12,053 --> 00:50:15,097
guys start coming at us from
out of the fuckin' trees. Now...

636
00:50:15,097 --> 00:50:18,391
I'll ask you again.
What the hell is going on here?

637
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:20,563
I'll tell you something.

638
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:24,104
I'm just a city boy.

639
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:27,526
What's going on here?
I haven't the slightest fucking idea.

640
00:50:27,526 --> 00:50:30,071
Except we ran into some people
that are real weird

641
00:50:30,071 --> 00:50:31,865
and I think maybe
they're trying to kill us.

642
00:50:31,865 --> 00:50:35,616
Because some asshole fired blanks
out of his damn machine gun.

643
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:36,956
Yeah.

644
00:50:36,956 --> 00:50:40,797
Because a bunch of assholes
stole some boats.

645
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,465
Yeah.

646
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:44,811
Hey, Casper!

647
00:51:44,811 --> 00:51:46,186
He's getting heavy.

648
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,731
It can't be too much further.

649
00:51:47,731 --> 00:51:49,569
Why don't we leave him
and come back?

650
00:51:49,569 --> 00:51:51,817
No. I told you before.

651
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:54,945
It's cold as a witch's tit and
this son of a bitch weighs a ton.

652
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,697
I don't wanna hear you
calling Poole that.

653
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:58,662
- He can't hear me.
- Well, I can.

654
00:51:58,662 --> 00:52:02,373
Shit, Casper, the cock-sucker's
dead. I'm just talking about the body.

655
00:52:02,373 --> 00:52:05,915
Goddamnit, Reece. I told you I didn't
want to hear you calling him that.

656
00:52:05,915 --> 00:52:07,377
Watch out.

657
00:52:07,377 --> 00:52:08,751
What?

658
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:11,004
What you almost stepped in.

659
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:14,845
Jesus Christ!

660
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,268
Look at them bastards.

661
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,563
It's like a steel pussy.

662
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:27,562
Hell, man. What kind of women
you been hangin' out with?

663
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:32,232
All laid out. Seven of them.

664
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,820
Like the rabbits.

665
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:35,157
There were eight rabbits.

666
00:52:35,157 --> 00:52:37,905
Then how come there's only
seven of these?

667
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:39,618
Did we lose anybody?

668
00:52:39,618 --> 00:52:41,241
They were set for us?

669
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:44,830
Either us or the last seven bears
in the state of Louisiana.

670
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:46,667
Hey.

671
00:52:46,667 --> 00:52:48,666
Quest-ce que c'est que ça?

672
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,423
What did you ask him?

673
00:52:54,423 --> 00:52:56,342
I asked him what
they were doing there.

674
00:52:56,342 --> 00:52:59,968
You son of a bitch.
Are there any more? Huh?

675
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:02,138
- I'm talking to you.
- All right.

676
00:53:02,138 --> 00:53:04,227
Reece, cut it out.
Come on, knock it off.

677
00:53:04,227 --> 00:53:06,937
Now, look. They didn't get us
and they're not gonna.

678
00:53:06,937 --> 00:53:09,186
Let's settle that we've wasted
enough time.

679
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:10,813
The interstate ain't that far away.

680
00:53:10,813 --> 00:53:14,110
Now, let's move out.
Cribbs, you take point.

681
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:16,327
Come on, Tyrone.

682
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:23,200
Damn, Casper.
I don't see why I'm point.

683
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,164
I don't know where the highway is

684
00:53:25,164 --> 00:53:27,456
and I know it. You're always talking
about, you know.

685
00:53:27,456 --> 00:53:29,750
Why don't you come up here
and be point?

686
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:32,342
No unnecessary noise
and no talking in formation.

687
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:43,763
Agh!

688
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,111
Cribbs!

689
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:56,696
Jesus Christ, Cribbs!

690
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:01,448
Our Father, who art in Heaven,

691
00:54:01,448 --> 00:54:03,620
Hallowed be Thy name.

692
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:06,579
Thy kingdom come,

693
00:54:06,579 --> 00:54:08,541
Thy will be done

694
00:54:08,541 --> 00:54:11,002
On earth as it is in heaven.

695
00:54:11,002 --> 00:54:14,093
Give us this day our daily bread.

696
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:17,425
Forgive us our trespasses...

697
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:21,968
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

698
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,888
Lead us not into temptation

699
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:27,514
But deliver us from evil.

700
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:30,103
For Thine is the kingdom,

701
00:54:30,103 --> 00:54:31,943
the p...

702
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:35,239
For Thine is the kingdom...

703
00:54:36,315 --> 00:54:38,568
For Thine is the kingdom...

704
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:45,165
And the power and the glory.
Forever, Amen.

705
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:56,045
We give this prayer as dead men
asking for our salvation.

706
00:54:56,045 --> 00:54:58,670
I don't wanna hear any more
of that kind of talk.

707
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:01,799
Now, we're at war and
that's all there is to it.

708
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:05,845
I want you men to start looking like
soldiers and not like mailmen.

709
00:55:05,845 --> 00:55:07,934
Weapons carried at the ready.

710
00:55:07,934 --> 00:55:10,895
We've only got about a half-hour
of daylight left

711
00:55:10,895 --> 00:55:13,519
so this is it – we'll bivouac here.

712
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:15,483
A clearing this big will make it tough

713
00:55:15,483 --> 00:55:17,652
for those bastards to come
sneak up on us.

714
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:22,319
Right. Hey, Casper.

715
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,821
Wait a second.

716
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:26,828
Talk a few things over, huh?

717
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:30,832
Tomorrow morning the helicopters'll
be out looking for us.

718
00:55:30,832 --> 00:55:34,125
Damn good chance they'll find us
if we stay on clear ground like this.

719
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:37,419
So all we have to worry about until
then is the Cajuns, right?

720
00:55:37,419 --> 00:55:41,007
We don't know the enemies'
strength or his disposition.

721
00:55:41,007 --> 00:55:43,757
And while he may have the
advantage of familiar terrain,

722
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:46,510
we have the advantage
of military training.

723
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:47,974
That's a terrific speech, Casper.

724
00:55:47,974 --> 00:55:49,972
But I want to improve
our odds a little bit.

725
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:51,893
What are you going after, Spencer?

726
00:55:51,893 --> 00:55:56,144
Maybe they want this trapper back.
Maybe he's all they want.

727
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:58,359
Let's take the chance and let him go.

728
00:55:58,359 --> 00:56:00,775
That man killed Poole.

729
00:56:00,775 --> 00:56:02,988
The only place he's going is with us.

730
00:56:02,988 --> 00:56:04,486
We don't know that he killed Poole.

731
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:07,032
He's just the first Cajun we ran into
after it happened.

732
00:56:07,032 --> 00:56:08,782
Hey, Spencer.

733
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,620
You know they're fixing to kill us all.

734
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:11,912
You got it.

735
00:56:11,912 --> 00:56:14,081
Look, I'm tired of hearing
about all this.

736
00:56:14,081 --> 00:56:17,253
Reece, you and Stuckey gag
the prisoner and tie him to a tree.

737
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:20,920
Simms, go on sentry.

738
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:24,636
Casper, you're a dumb asshole.

739
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:30,850
Now, you listen to me, Spencer,
and you listen real good.

740
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:34,393
Tomorrow morning we're heading
north with the prisoner.

741
00:56:34,393 --> 00:56:36,894
The man who killed Crawford Poole,

742
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:39,897
the man whose buddies killed
Tyrone Cribbs.

743
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:43,151
In case you've forgotten, Spencer,
they were friends of ours.

744
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:50,158
Now, let's all get unpacked
and bedded down.

745
00:56:50,158 --> 00:56:52,034
No fire tonight.

746
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:31,744
You all right?

747
00:57:31,744 --> 00:57:33,663
Yeah, I'm OK.

748
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,913
You know, you might be right
about the trapper.

749
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:42,378
Why the hell didn't you
say anything?

750
00:57:42,378 --> 00:57:45,379
Maybe I can't believe any of this shit,
that's why.

751
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:48,382
Oh. Well, let me know
when you start.

752
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:52,386
Look, the problem ain't what the hell
I believe in or don't believe in.

753
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:54,307
What is?

754
00:57:54,307 --> 00:57:57,683
How long we're gonna follow
this dumb bastard, Casper.

755
00:57:57,683 --> 00:58:00,937
Looks to me like he's leading us
round in circles.

756
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:03,613
And?

757
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:06,529
Maybe we need a new leader.

758
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,744
You volunteering for the job?

759
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:13,907
I'm the new boy, remember?

760
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:17,204
You know these guys.
It's your move.

761
00:58:17,204 --> 00:58:19,921
Besides, I'm not
the volunteering type.

762
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,792
You're terrific, Hardin.

763
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:25,919
You don't want to volunteer
for yourself

764
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:29,048
but you don't mind at all volunteering
me for the court martial.

765
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:34,185
Fuck you.

766
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:49,319
I got something to tell you, Casper.

767
00:58:49,319 --> 00:58:51,445
- Fragmentation.
- What?

768
00:58:53,405 --> 00:58:56,659
Remember your training.
I'm making a grenade here.

769
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:01,456
Even blank rounds can save
your life if you improvise.

770
00:59:01,456 --> 00:59:04,583
Damn it, Casper, don't give me
this crap. This is important.

771
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:06,254
It's Bowden.

772
00:59:06,254 --> 00:59:08,966
There's something wrong with him.
He won't talk.

773
00:59:08,966 --> 00:59:11,759
Spencer says he's just gone
totally crazy.

774
00:59:11,759 --> 00:59:14,721
You'd better come on over.
I think he's right.

775
00:59:14,721 --> 00:59:16,345
Come on.

776
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:40,203
Hey look, Bowden. I know it's been
kinda rough on all of us.

777
00:59:40,203 --> 00:59:42,796
I can understand you're not
feeling too good.

778
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:46,049
Why don't you talk to us about it?

779
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:51,425
Come on, Bowden.

780
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:02,643
Bowden, I'm giving you an order.

781
01:00:02,643 --> 01:00:04,643
Now, damn it, talk to us.

782
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:14,363
Hell, I don't know.

783
01:00:14,363 --> 01:00:15,862
I do.

784
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:17,785
The motherfucker's crazy.

785
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:22,294
Well, what we gonna do with him?

786
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:26,874
Just leave him there.
Maybe he'll be better in the morning.

787
01:00:26,874 --> 01:00:28,044
The hell we are.

788
01:00:28,044 --> 01:00:32,588
This guy made his own bomb,
remember. You gonna tie him up.

789
01:00:32,588 --> 01:00:35,551
Yeah, we don't want him walking
around when we're sleeping.

790
01:00:35,551 --> 01:00:37,094
He's way too big and dangerous.

791
01:00:37,094 --> 01:00:39,641
- Use your head, Casper.
- He's right.

792
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:43,515
He is, Casper. What the hell?

793
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:47,190
Won't hurt none to tie him up.
Ain't no good to us anyhow.

794
01:00:48,687 --> 01:00:51,108
Never was, as far as that goes.

795
01:00:51,108 --> 01:00:54,277
If he's tied up we lose
potential fire power.

796
01:00:54,277 --> 01:00:55,740
Jesus Christ, Casper.

797
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:58,363
Get a goddamn rope and
quit jerking off about fire power.

798
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:00,909
Remember what happened the last
time you mouthed off to me?

799
01:01:00,909 --> 01:01:03,956
Bullshit, Casper!
This ain't a goddamn game.

800
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:12,711
All right, there's 40 feet of rope
in my pack.

801
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:14,679
Go get it, Simms.

802
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,780
What the hell are you doin', Reece?

803
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:25,250
This man's gonna talk to me.

804
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:29,249
Let him up.

805
01:02:29,249 --> 01:02:31,840
You stay out of this.

806
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:35,256
I said let him up.

807
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:39,301
Sure.

808
01:02:39,301 --> 01:02:41,675
Now are you happy?

809
01:02:46,225 --> 01:02:49,060
That's the second time
you asked for it with me.

810
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:51,559
This time you're going to get
an answer.

811
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:54,775
About time I paid you off, cowboy.

812
01:02:54,775 --> 01:02:58,150
How about I blow
your fuckin' head off, Reece?

813
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:01,320
You ain't got the balls.

814
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:10,458
OK, you got it.

815
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:33,484
(Speaks French)

816
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:01,796
Tuez!

817
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:02,797
Kill him!

818
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,592
Kill him!

819
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:23,364
He's dead.

820
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,867
Reece is dead.

821
01:04:26,867 --> 01:04:30,163
Looks like your prisoner got away,
Casper.

822
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:34,331
Lonnie!

823
01:04:34,331 --> 01:04:37,207
- Come on!
- Let me go!

824
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:39,127
Goddamnit! Let me go!

825
01:04:39,127 --> 01:04:41,127
I'm gonna get you,
you son of a bitch.

826
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:43,050
You hear me? I'm gonna get you.

827
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,444
How many more graves are
we gonna be leaving back here?

828
01:05:03,444 --> 01:05:04,943
No more of ours, I can tell you that.

829
01:05:04,943 --> 01:05:06,365
Yeah? You can tell me that.

830
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,826
Shut up.

831
01:05:10,826 --> 01:05:12,951
You talking to me?

832
01:05:12,951 --> 01:05:15,540
I'm talking to everybody
including you.

833
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:18,040
Keep your mouth shut
and dig the grave.

834
01:05:19,082 --> 01:05:21,960
Why don't you dig it?
You're the one that killed him.

835
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,586
I'm not going to tell you again.

836
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:26,965
Keep your fucking mouth shut,
and dig the goddamn grave.

837
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:30,060
I don't want any more shit
out of you either.

838
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:39,189
Look, just do what
the hell he says – dig.

839
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:59,333
We've had three casualties.
We're not going to have any more.

840
01:05:59,333 --> 01:06:01,708
Survival is a mental outlook.

841
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:03,835
If you're not prepared mentally

842
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:06,838
to overcome all obstacles
and hardships,

843
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:08,681
the chances of you
coming out alive...

844
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:12,139
...are greatly reduced.

845
01:06:12,139 --> 01:06:15,263
We're getting tired of listening
to all this, Casper.

846
01:06:15,263 --> 01:06:18,229
Goddamn you, Spencer,
I'm trying to do my best.

847
01:06:18,229 --> 01:06:23,105
I know you are, Casper, but quoting
the manual to us isn't helping much.

848
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:26,277
You think you could do any better?

849
01:06:26,277 --> 01:06:27,613
Yeah, I do.

850
01:06:27,613 --> 01:06:29,573
But I'm the team leader.

851
01:06:29,573 --> 01:06:32,284
You're not even a corporal
You're just a PFC.

852
01:06:32,284 --> 01:06:35,995
Hey!
I'm getting tired of this damn crap.

853
01:06:35,995 --> 01:06:38,664
I'm with you, Spencer.

854
01:06:38,664 --> 01:06:43,007
Casper, you ain't never going to find
that fuckin' highway.

855
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:47,172
Casper, you promise me

856
01:06:47,172 --> 01:06:50,385
that this Texas asshole's
going to be court-martialed?

857
01:06:50,385 --> 01:06:53,806
He's got to be.
He killed a fellow soldier.

858
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:57,438
Then I'm with you.

859
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:00,270
Hardin?

860
01:07:01,476 --> 01:07:05,572
What's this voting bullshit?
Let's get movin'.

861
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:11,031
Come on, Bowden. Let's go home.

862
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:15,323
Spencer, you just can't
walk off like this.

863
01:07:15,323 --> 01:07:18,953
We're a squad, a unit.
We're Bravo Team.

864
01:07:20,078 --> 01:07:21,623
You guys are deserting.

865
01:07:21,623 --> 01:07:24,249
You bet your ass we are.

866
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,923
You coming?

867
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:30,839
Come on, Stuckey. Let's go.

868
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:02,539
How's your arm?

869
01:08:02,539 --> 01:08:04,631
It'll be all right.

870
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:08,918
Look, for what it's worth...

871
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:11,757
I know Reece was a real
son of a bitch.

872
01:08:11,757 --> 01:08:14,344
I don't wanna talk about him.

873
01:08:14,344 --> 01:08:18,180
Yeah, well,
maybe it was self defense.

874
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:20,271
Look, let's just drop it.

875
01:08:21,723 --> 01:08:23,350
It's over with.

876
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:27,441
Right.

877
01:08:27,441 --> 01:08:29,357
Hey, Spencer.

878
01:08:29,357 --> 01:08:31,232
What chance do we got?

879
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:34,198
You're always so smart
about everything.

880
01:08:34,198 --> 01:08:37,947
Now you're the leader
so give me an answer.

881
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:41,036
Right now they got state troopers,
helicopters, hound dogs,

882
01:08:41,036 --> 01:08:42,749
everybody in Louisiana
looking for us.

883
01:08:42,749 --> 01:08:46,247
Spencer, I've had it with
them hound dogs.

884
01:08:46,247 --> 01:08:47,373
Tell you something else.

885
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:49,751
Who's ever looking for us,
they better make it quick.

886
01:09:25,912 --> 01:09:27,880
Hey!

887
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:51,821
Come on!

888
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:04,286
Simms! What the fuck is going on?

889
01:10:04,286 --> 01:10:06,621
- I thought I saw something.
- Where?

890
01:10:06,621 --> 01:10:07,870
Over there.

891
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:10,290
Are you sure? I didn't hear anything.

892
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:11,415
Me neither.

893
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:14,293
Didn't you hear it?
You musta heard it.

894
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:15,633
I didn't hear nothing.

895
01:10:15,633 --> 01:10:18,005
You wasted your bullets
just like Bowden did.

896
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:20,469
Well, there's nothing now.

897
01:10:20,469 --> 01:10:22,594
What the fuck?

898
01:10:23,845 --> 01:10:26,268
Come on. Let's take off.

899
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:54,508
Motherfuckers!

900
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:03,100
Simms!

901
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:05,140
Simms!

902
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:14,232
Simms!

903
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:23,287
Simms!

904
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:32,372
No more!

905
01:11:32,372 --> 01:11:35,085
- Christ!
- They dug 'em up.

906
01:11:35,085 --> 01:11:37,460
They dug 'em all up.

907
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,468
- Come on, this way.
- Let's get outta here.

908
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:42,153
Bowden! For Christ's sake!

909
01:12:57,248 --> 01:12:59,750
They've outflanked us.
We're pinned down.

910
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:01,589
Would you cover me, Simms?

911
01:13:01,589 --> 01:13:03,550
With what? All I got is blanks.

912
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:06,467
No radio contact, no ammo,
no air support, no mortars.

913
01:13:06,467 --> 01:13:08,467
How the hell are we supposed
to fight with that?

914
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:11,139
Don't fucking ask me.
You're supposed to know that.

915
01:13:11,139 --> 01:13:13,890
Well, fire goddamn blanks.
Use anything you got.

916
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:51,679
We got four bullets.

917
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:55,141
- I got mine.
- You shot yours, asshole.

918
01:13:55,141 --> 01:13:57,016
Get ready.

919
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,498
Come on. We gotta retreat.

920
01:14:18,245 --> 01:14:22,045
Retreat! Retreat! Pull back!
Pull back!

921
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,330
Listen.

922
01:14:59,330 --> 01:15:01,080
What?

923
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:02,957
Listen.

924
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:07,928
I don't hear anything.

925
01:15:11,382 --> 01:15:13,884
I can hear it.

926
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:24,232
There!

927
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:35,031
Hey! Down here!

928
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:41,287
Over here!

929
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:45,796
- Over here!
- Down here!

930
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:53,515
Hey! Come back!

931
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:57,975
- Down here!
- Down here!

932
01:16:13,444 --> 01:16:15,740
If he did see us
he's got to come back for us.

933
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:18,537
He couldn't land here -
there's too many trees.

934
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:23,292
Hey.

935
01:16:23,292 --> 01:16:26,086
Where's Stuckey?

936
01:16:47,478 --> 01:16:49,572
Please!

937
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:54,785
Help me!

938
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:00,616
Please!

939
01:17:18,217 --> 01:17:20,140
Stuckey!

940
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:24,767
- Stuckey!
- Shit!

941
01:17:24,767 --> 01:17:27,435
All right, we spread out.
We gotta find him.

942
01:17:27,435 --> 01:17:29,105
Buddy teams. Me and Hardin.

943
01:17:29,105 --> 01:17:30,942
I'll take Bowden.
Casper, you go with Simms.

944
01:17:30,942 --> 01:17:33,190
First team to find him fire a blank
every five minutes.

945
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:34,942
The other team will work
its way there. OK?

946
01:17:34,942 --> 01:17:36,532
What if we don't find him?

947
01:17:36,532 --> 01:17:40,281
We'll wait an hour. Fire five blanks
then one blank every five minutes.

948
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:42,079
Both teams will work back
to each other.

949
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:45,753
Let's go.

950
01:17:57,006 --> 01:17:58,633
Stuckey!

951
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:07,604
Stuckey!

952
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:18,286
Stuckey! You little fuckin' redneck,
where are you?

953
01:18:22,823 --> 01:18:25,167
Shit!

954
01:18:41,592 --> 01:18:43,594
Dirty sons of bitches.

955
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:46,847
Go on, Simms.
Get back to the others.

956
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:49,142
- You're crazy.
- Go on.

957
01:18:49,142 --> 01:18:50,730
You're crazy!

958
01:18:50,730 --> 01:18:52,945
You heard me. Go on.
Get outta here.

959
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:17,108
I didn't do anything wrong.

960
01:20:18,731 --> 01:20:21,200
I'm not supposed to be here.

961
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:24,863
I'm not supposed to be here.

962
01:20:35,247 --> 01:20:36,999
Stuckey!

963
01:21:00,898 --> 01:21:04,739
I think all we're doing is telling
the opposition where we are.

964
01:21:04,739 --> 01:21:08,114
They haven't had too much trouble
finding us up to now.

965
01:21:10,032 --> 01:21:12,376
Casper!

966
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:15,962
Simms!

967
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:20,838
Come on, let's go.

968
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:26,723
We gotta go for ourselves now.

969
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:29,935
The others make it,
then they make it.

970
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:32,893
Yeah, OK.

971
01:22:13,095 --> 01:22:15,934
Boy, it's a great state
you got here, Spencer.

972
01:22:15,934 --> 01:22:18,434
Sent out one fuckin' helicopter.

973
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:21,525
What do you want them to do?
Send out the National Guard?

974
01:22:21,525 --> 01:22:25,774
Civilian in peace, soldier in war,
I am the Guard.

975
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:27,321
Bowden?

976
01:22:28,318 --> 01:22:29,945
Hey, Bowden.

977
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:31,743
You wanna talk?

978
01:22:33,157 --> 01:22:34,625
Hey, coach.

979
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:42,293
What's he coach anyway?

980
01:22:42,293 --> 01:22:44,336
Football. What else?

981
01:22:44,336 --> 01:22:47,338
Think he teaches history
or something too.

982
01:22:48,422 --> 01:22:51,892
Looks like it's all history for him now,
poor bastard.

983
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:55,931
Could be history for a couple of
other poor bastards around here

984
01:22:55,931 --> 01:22:57,767
if we don't get a break.

985
01:22:57,767 --> 01:22:59,061
Yeah.

986
01:23:04,271 --> 01:23:06,648
Tomorrow about this time
you'll be sitting in your den

987
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:08,444
with a beer in your hand
looking at the tube

988
01:23:08,444 --> 01:23:10,406
and listening to
your old lady's bullshit.

989
01:23:10,406 --> 01:23:12,404
I don't have a den.

990
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:14,867
I'll buy you one
if we ever get out of here.

991
01:23:14,867 --> 01:23:16,162
Great.

992
01:23:18,785 --> 01:23:20,537
How long you been married?

993
01:23:22,456 --> 01:23:24,049
Five years.

994
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:27,298
<i>Happy?</i> Hmm?

995
01:23:28,629 --> 01:23:30,549
As in happily married?

996
01:23:30,549 --> 01:23:32,265
Yeah.

997
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:37,096
I like her.
She's got a good sense of humor.

998
01:23:37,096 --> 01:23:39,063
What's it to you?

999
01:23:40,474 --> 01:23:44,445
I just thought if I got outta here and
you didn't maybe I'd look her up.

1000
01:23:47,856 --> 01:23:51,109
I said she had a good sense
of humor. I don't.

1001
01:23:51,109 --> 01:23:52,199
Yeah.

1002
01:23:52,199 --> 01:23:55,494
Mine's stretched a bit thin
too at the moment.

1003
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:02,542
Since they got the trapper back...

1004
01:24:04,206 --> 01:24:07,551
...they must be hunting us
just for the fun of it.

1005
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:12,048
You got an idea of something
we can do about it

1006
01:24:12,048 --> 01:24:14,345
or are you just talking
for the record?

1007
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:18,846
I'll tell you what I'm saying
for the record.

1008
01:24:20,472 --> 01:24:22,349
I wanna live.

1009
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:26,904
I don't know how I'm going to do it...

1010
01:24:28,272 --> 01:24:30,616
...but I'm gonna fight my way
outta here.

1011
01:24:34,695 --> 01:24:38,245
Well... don't forget
to save me a seat, pal.

1012
01:24:41,493 --> 01:24:43,712
Don't worry. You got it.

1013
01:25:37,257 --> 01:25:38,850
Let's go.

1014
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:03,617
Poor son of a bitch.

1015
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:07,504
I'm not gonna kill y'all
if I don't got to.

1016
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:10,875
You got a bayou over here.

1017
01:26:10,875 --> 01:26:12,419
Take it.

1018
01:26:12,419 --> 01:26:15,045
Stay to the west side.

1019
01:26:15,045 --> 01:26:18,423
You gonna find a road
about a mile up d'ere.

1020
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:21,469
Do you mind telling us
what's going on?

1021
01:26:21,469 --> 01:26:22,844
It's real simple.

1022
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:27,849
We live back in here. This is our
home and nobody don't fuck with us.

1023
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:31,065
- What about him?
- What about him?

1024
01:26:31,065 --> 01:26:35,111
Did he do it to himself or
did your friends help him out?

1025
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:41,700
If I was you all I'd quit ax'ing
question and haul ass.

1026
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:45,075
And my buddies?
They're not nice like me.

1027
01:26:45,075 --> 01:26:46,827
Are we supposed to say thanks?

1028
01:26:46,827 --> 01:26:49,792
You not supposed to say nothin'.

1029
01:26:49,792 --> 01:26:52,208
Soldier.

1030
01:26:52,208 --> 01:26:54,084
Come on, Hardin.

1031
01:27:22,612 --> 01:27:24,410
Over there.

1032
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:28,911
A truck.

1033
01:27:28,911 --> 01:27:31,083
Fucking truck.

1034
01:28:10,535 --> 01:28:12,955
Vous étes perdus, eh?

1035
01:28:12,955 --> 01:28:14,831
Huh?

1036
01:28:14,831 --> 01:28:17,046
Er... You lose you in there.

1037
01:28:17,046 --> 01:28:19,588
Uh, yeah.

1038
01:28:19,588 --> 01:28:22,301
You wanna ride, uh?

1039
01:28:22,301 --> 01:28:25,263
God, yes.

1040
01:28:25,263 --> 01:28:29,763
Jettes toi en arriére.
Throw you in the back.

1041
01:28:29,763 --> 01:28:32,934
Sure, you bet. Next town, right?

1042
01:28:32,934 --> 01:28:35,903
- That's right, yeah.
- Great.

1043
01:29:56,391 --> 01:30:00,520
This can't be Catahoula.
Some backwoods stop.

1044
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:04,024
What happened to that town
they were taking us to?

1045
01:30:04,024 --> 01:30:05,776
I guess this is it.

1046
01:30:06,985 --> 01:30:08,699
Say, where is the telephone?

1047
01:30:08,699 --> 01:30:10,490
Pas de telephones ici.

1048
01:30:10,490 --> 01:30:13,078
We got electric light but we don't got
no telephone.

1049
01:30:13,078 --> 01:30:15,952
We wanna go to a town
with a telephone.

1050
01:30:15,952 --> 01:30:18,247
Eat first. You can go
in town more later.

1051
01:30:18,247 --> 01:30:20,211
No, we wanna go to town now.

1052
01:30:20,211 --> 01:30:24,253
No, have something to drink.
Spend some good time with us.

1053
01:30:24,253 --> 01:30:26,298
Laissez es bons temps rouler.

1054
01:30:26,298 --> 01:30:28,762
You make that telephone more later.

1055
01:30:28,762 --> 01:30:32,978
You come with me. I'm gonna show
you where you can wash yourselves.

1056
01:30:35,805 --> 01:30:37,648
(Speaks French)

1057
01:30:58,954 --> 01:31:01,375
Wash up?

1058
01:31:01,375 --> 01:31:03,842
(Speaks French)

1059
01:31:18,348 --> 01:31:20,225
What do you think?

1060
01:31:22,894 --> 01:31:24,733
I think I feel better.

1061
01:31:24,733 --> 01:31:26,606
Cleaner, anyway.

1062
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:28,108
Yeah?

1063
01:31:28,108 --> 01:31:30,279
But what about safer?

1064
01:31:30,279 --> 01:31:33,621
Well, I wouldn't lie down
and go to sleep.

1065
01:31:35,615 --> 01:31:38,454
Maybe we oughta forget about
Mr. and Mrs. Cajun

1066
01:31:38,454 --> 01:31:40,954
and try to find the next town
by ourselves.

1067
01:31:40,954 --> 01:31:44,833
What for? If they're still hunting us
they'd find us in the swamp.

1068
01:31:44,833 --> 01:31:46,585
We're safer here.

1069
01:31:48,294 --> 01:31:49,840
OK.

1070
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:53,012
But we grab a ride with the
first thing outta here.

1071
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:09,240
Biére.

1072
01:32:10,608 --> 01:32:12,201
Merci.

1073
01:32:32,255 --> 01:32:34,844
Relax, Hardin.
These are the good Cajuns.

1074
01:32:34,844 --> 01:32:36,929
The other guys are a long
ways back.

1075
01:32:36,929 --> 01:32:38,519
You relax.

1076
01:32:53,109 --> 01:32:56,534
(I Dewey Balfa: Parlez Nous a Boires)

1077
01:33:06,164 --> 01:33:10,756
Oh parlez-nous a boire,
non pas du marriage

1078
01:33:10,756 --> 01:33:15,175
Toujours en regrettant,

1079
01:33:15,175 --> 01:33:19,264

01:33:23,977 --> 01:33:28,271

T'es clans les grands dangers

1083
01:34:46,472 --> 01:34:48,060
Look at those two guys.

1084
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:49,396
What two guys?

1085
01:34:49,396 --> 01:34:50,811
Getting out the boat.

1086
01:34:50,811 --> 01:34:51,980
Yeah.

1087
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:54,948
D'you think they're the ones
that've been after us?

1088
01:34:56,691 --> 01:34:59,030
Hell, I don't know.
I never seen them.

1089
01:34:59,030 --> 01:35:01,117
I think it's them.

1090
01:35:01,117 --> 01:35:03,908
Don't go getting paranoid on me.

1091
01:35:03,908 --> 01:35:06,121
I got reason to be paranoid
and so do you.

1092
01:35:06,121 --> 01:35:08,745
They gotta kill us.
We're the only witnesses.

1093
01:35:08,745 --> 01:35:12,416
Don't sweat it. They can't pull
anything here in front of everybody.

1094
01:35:12,416 --> 01:35:14,710
- Allons dancer.
- Huh?

1095
01:35:14,710 --> 01:35:16,173
Allons dancer.

1096
01:35:16,173 --> 01:35:17,842
- Dancer?
- Dancer.

1097
01:36:50,138 --> 01:36:52,390
I'm telling you, Hardin, relax.

1098
01:36:52,390 --> 01:36:53,812
Right.

1099
01:37:23,421 --> 01:37:24,889
Excusez-moi.

1100
01:40:28,731 --> 01:40:30,699
Agh!
