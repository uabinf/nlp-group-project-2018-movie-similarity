<b>Life Is Beautiful AKA La vita e bella
Comedy Drama 1997 720p [H246-mp4] English</b>

2
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,726
This is a simple story...

3
00:00:40,976 --> 00:00:43,355
but not an easy one to tell

4
00:00:43,815 --> 00:00:45,734
Like a fable, there is sorrow...

5
00:00:45,735 --> 00:00:49,492
and like a fable, it is full
of wonder and happiness

6
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:54,416
Arezzo, Italy, 1939

7
00:00:54,585 --> 00:00:58,175
I sing what I see, nothing gets by
me. "Here I am," said I to chaos...

8
00:00:58,426 --> 00:01:00,806
"I am your slave!"
And he: "Good!"

9
00:01:00,972 --> 00:01:02,642
"For what?" Said I

10
00:01:03,102 --> 00:01:07,652
Free in the end, I am! What
good is a caress when bliss...

11
00:01:07,944 --> 00:01:09,571
this man came to possess?

12
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:11,534
Here I am ready

13
00:01:11,868 --> 00:01:14,331
The trains are gone,
the brakes are gone

14
00:01:14,706 --> 00:01:18,045
And I can resist no more. Go,
sweet Bacchus, take me...

15
00:01:18,171 --> 00:01:21,260
The brakes are gone!

16
00:01:21,553 --> 00:01:22,553
I heard you!

17
00:01:22,638 --> 00:01:25,726
- No, they're really gone!
- Hit the brakes!

18
00:01:25,727 --> 00:01:26,896
Weren't you reciting a poem?

19
00:01:28,942 --> 00:01:30,361
It doesn't work!

20
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,580
Brake!

21
00:01:36,748 --> 00:01:41,131
We're going to die! The woods!

22
00:01:45,974 --> 00:01:47,894
Brake!

23
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,532
The king is coming!

24
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:57,077
There he is!

25
00:01:58,749 --> 00:02:01,544
There's a heap of people
down there. Straight!

26
00:02:01,545 --> 00:02:03,131
We have no brakes!

27
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,350
We have no brakes! Move!

28
00:02:24,464 --> 00:02:25,633
LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL

29
00:02:33,815 --> 00:02:35,693
Go for a walk

30
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:38,322
Otherwise, we'll
get there tomorrow

31
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,244
I found the screw

32
00:02:41,997 --> 00:02:43,332
Now what do you need?

33
00:02:44,084 --> 00:02:46,296
Nothing. I need
ten minutes alone

34
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:49,595
All right, I'll leave you alone

35
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,431
Do you want the
screw from before?

36
00:02:52,183 --> 00:02:54,729
No, I want to be alone

37
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:08,046
Do I toss out the
screw if I find it?

38
00:03:13,056 --> 00:03:14,975
I'm going to wash my hands

39
00:03:22,156 --> 00:03:25,746
Pretty girl! How's it going?

40
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,122
What are you doing?

41
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,003
Did your Mom put
this stuff here?

42
00:03:30,255 --> 00:03:31,423
No, the landlady did

43
00:03:31,633 --> 00:03:35,139
Is it a market? It's beautiful

44
00:03:35,306 --> 00:03:37,426
How much is it? How old are
you? Where's your mother?

45
00:03:37,644 --> 00:03:40,899
- What's your name?
- Eleonora

46
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:43,445
Nice to meet you,
I'm Prince Guido

47
00:03:43,655 --> 00:03:44,739
Prince?

48
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:46,828
I'm a prince, I am!

49
00:03:47,121 --> 00:03:48,290
All this is mine

50
00:03:48,832 --> 00:03:50,001
The principiant here...

51
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:51,336
is of the prince's principate

52
00:03:51,921 --> 00:03:55,428
I'll call this place, Addis
Ababa. I'll change it all!

53
00:03:55,886 --> 00:03:58,975
Out go the cows, in
come the camels!

54
00:03:59,226 --> 00:04:01,229
Camels?

55
00:04:01,314 --> 00:04:03,358
Even a few hippopotamus!

56
00:04:03,526 --> 00:04:05,906
I have to go. I have an
appointment with the princess

57
00:04:06,365 --> 00:04:07,826
- When?
- Now!

58
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,841
Good morning, princess!

59
00:04:15,383 --> 00:04:18,474
How frightening! I almost
killed myself. Did I hurt you?

60
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,187
I've never been better

61
00:04:20,605 --> 00:04:22,205
Do you always leave
the house like this?

62
00:04:22,276 --> 00:04:25,407
I wanted to burn that
wasps' nest but I got stung

63
00:04:25,408 --> 00:04:27,622
A wasp stung you?
There? Allow me

64
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,210
Hold still, princess

65
00:04:30,253 --> 00:04:33,052
A wasp's poison
is very dangerous

66
00:04:33,136 --> 00:04:34,556
You have to get it out

67
00:04:34,723 --> 00:04:38,064
- Lie down, it'll take a while.
- It's fine now. Thank you

68
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,952
- Did you get stung anywhere else?
- No, thank you

69
00:04:43,495 --> 00:04:45,959
What a place here!
It's beautiful!

70
00:04:46,335 --> 00:04:49,217
Pigeons fly, women fall from
the sky. I'm moving here!

71
00:04:49,593 --> 00:04:53,102
It's all his! He wants to fill
it with camels! He's a prince!

72
00:04:53,938 --> 00:04:54,940
Exactly!

73
00:04:55,442 --> 00:04:58,114
Prince Guido, at your
service, princess

74
00:04:59,285 --> 00:05:00,705
I'm coming!

75
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,334
Goodbye, then

76
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:04,672
How can I thank you?

77
00:05:04,965 --> 00:05:06,051
There's no need

78
00:05:06,344 --> 00:05:08,474
If you really want
to thank me...

79
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,149
I'll take some eggs to make
a nice omelet for my squire

80
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:14,321
Take whatever you
want, it's all yours!

81
00:05:14,322 --> 00:05:15,407
Thank you!

82
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,459
I'll take two... six. All
right? I'll make a nice omelet

83
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:23,804
Goodbye, Eleonora!
My regards, princess

84
00:05:24,722 --> 00:05:25,891
Farewell

85
00:05:26,937 --> 00:05:30,862
Here I am, Nuvolari! It's
eggs for us tonight!

86
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,577
All camels here!

87
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:46,484
- Where is this house?
- Turn left. We're almost there

88
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,322
Is your uncle sleeping with us?

89
00:05:48,574 --> 00:05:51,831
What? He's lived in the hotel for over
30 years. He's a head maitre d'...

90
00:05:51,915 --> 00:05:55,006
He's lending us the house.
He uses it for storage

91
00:05:55,131 --> 00:05:56,551
There, we're here

92
00:05:57,052 --> 00:06:00,018
That's Robin Hood,
my uncle's horse

93
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:03,485
That's my uncle's buggy and
that's my uncle's house

94
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,117
And inside is my uncle

95
00:06:06,827 --> 00:06:09,291
Hello, dear uncle, here
we are! Hurry, it's late

96
00:06:09,626 --> 00:06:10,906
Here we are. The car broke down!

97
00:06:15,348 --> 00:06:20,151
Uncle Eliseo!

98
00:06:22,826 --> 00:06:24,872
- Barbarians!
- Who were they?

99
00:06:25,206 --> 00:06:27,377
- Nobody, just barbarians.
- Why didn't you cry for help?

100
00:06:27,378 --> 00:06:30,343
Silence is the most powerful cry

101
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:31,848
Is he your poet friend?

102
00:06:32,056 --> 00:06:35,147
My name is Ferruccio.
I'm also an upholsterer

103
00:06:35,356 --> 00:06:38,613
You'll have to make do here. It's an
old storehouse full of odds and ends

104
00:06:38,906 --> 00:06:42,832
an old passion, an
odd end in itself!

105
00:06:43,626 --> 00:06:45,547
What's all this stuff for?

106
00:06:45,716 --> 00:06:49,475
You can stay as long as you want.
It's not easy to be a waiter

107
00:06:50,268 --> 00:06:52,815
That's the bed. Legend has
it Garibaldi slept there

108
00:06:53,318 --> 00:06:55,698
Nothing is more necessary
than the unnecessary

109
00:06:55,866 --> 00:06:56,866
Barbarians

110
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:00,668
The town hall is on Via Sestani,
to the right after the colonnade

111
00:07:00,794 --> 00:07:05,765
This is the bathroom, equipped with
the appropriate invention of M. Bidet

112
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:09,065
There are a few books here, among
which, the Life of Petrarch

113
00:07:09,232 --> 00:07:13,367
The kitchen is in there. This is a
velocipede, commonly called a bike

114
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:18,337
I have to get back to the hotel
There's only one key, don't lose it

115
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:20,676
It's so good to see you!

116
00:07:21,513 --> 00:07:23,225
I'm coming, Robin Hood!

117
00:07:26,608 --> 00:07:27,694
What an uncle!

118
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:31,453
Look at this!

119
00:07:31,997 --> 00:07:35,254
Didn't I tell you? We're in a
city, you do whatever you want

120
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,470
We're free, if you want to
do something, you do it

121
00:07:38,555 --> 00:07:42,648
You want to let yourself go?
You want to yell? Yell!

122
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:47,828
Stop it! What are you, crazy?

123
00:07:47,912 --> 00:07:50,877
We're in a city. You can't act
like you do in the country!

124
00:07:51,211 --> 00:07:54,552
You've been yelling like a madman
for three hours! You can't yell!

125
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,934
Mary! The key!

126
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,444
See? You can't yell

127
00:08:03,074 --> 00:08:06,414
Understand? If you stopped
thinking so much about poetry...

128
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,592
you'd make your father happier and
you'd make more money than him

129
00:08:10,718 --> 00:08:12,678
That's right, Oreste,
that's what I tell him too:

130
00:08:12,765 --> 00:08:14,812
You have to settle down!

131
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,234
What a nice hat!
How does it look?

132
00:08:17,987 --> 00:08:20,534
- Nice, huh? How does it look?
- Nice, but it's mine

133
00:08:20,827 --> 00:08:22,539
When do I start working?

134
00:08:22,748 --> 00:08:24,962
You're already late! Right away!

135
00:08:25,337 --> 00:08:27,634
Get that armchair and
take it to the laboratory

136
00:08:28,095 --> 00:08:31,937
- That one?
- That one. And be careful!

137
00:08:32,857 --> 00:08:35,404
Good. I'm going to the
town hall. Goodbye

138
00:08:35,655 --> 00:08:38,036
Goodbye, and behave yourselves

139
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,374
Because these are hard times...

140
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,839
hard, hard times!

141
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,385
They're hard times?

142
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,517
Why? What are your
political views?

143
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:50,316
Benito! Adolph! Be good!

144
00:08:51,654 --> 00:08:53,282
What did you say?

145
00:08:54,494 --> 00:08:57,501
I said... how are things going?

146
00:08:57,752 --> 00:08:58,921
Goodbye, then

147
00:08:59,464 --> 00:09:03,306
Careful, you'll break the legs!

148
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:04,601
Goodbye!

149
00:09:10,491 --> 00:09:13,665
He pulled it off. He took my
hat. I'll find him, though

150
00:09:15,337 --> 00:09:17,133
Benito, you're going
to get slapped!

151
00:09:19,305 --> 00:09:22,981
I need to do the whole bureauratic
procedure to open a bookstore

152
00:09:23,106 --> 00:09:25,153
- Does it take a long time?
- Years

153
00:09:25,821 --> 00:09:28,118
Then we'd better open a file now

154
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:31,460
First you have to apply and the
department head has to sign it

155
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,339
In the meantime...

156
00:09:34,301 --> 00:09:37,976
I almost scrambled my eggs! I've
had these here since yesterday!

157
00:09:38,186 --> 00:09:41,276
I forgot about them. Thank goodness
they didn't break. Take note

158
00:09:41,652 --> 00:09:43,156
I, the undersigned,
Guido Orefice...

159
00:09:43,406 --> 00:09:45,953
- am applying to open - He
can't sign it right now!

160
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:49,212
What's going on?

161
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:52,345
I need a signature of yours
to open a bookstore of mine

162
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,477
- Miss, what's going on?
- Mr. Rodolfo, I told him

163
00:09:55,603 --> 00:09:58,067
- Just one signature.
- No, I can't

164
00:09:58,193 --> 00:10:00,573
My substitute will be
here in an hour. Ask him

165
00:10:00,741 --> 00:10:03,790
- All I need is a signature.
- We close at 1:00 here!

166
00:10:04,918 --> 00:10:06,505
It's ten to 1:00

167
00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:08,260
File a complaint!

168
00:10:09,471 --> 00:10:11,852
Boy, is he nasty!

169
00:10:12,521 --> 00:10:16,113
Just sign a paper to open a
file. All he had to do was this

170
00:10:16,573 --> 00:10:19,245
Now I have to wait for his substitute
who's coming here in an hour

171
00:10:19,371 --> 00:10:22,211
I'm filing a complaint. Write: I,
the undersigned, Guido Orefice...

172
00:10:25,511 --> 00:10:26,931
What a wallop!

173
00:10:31,066 --> 00:10:33,363
Are you hurt? I'll help you

174
00:10:33,573 --> 00:10:35,577
Come here. I didn't
do it on purpose

175
00:10:35,912 --> 00:10:36,997
Don't touch me!

176
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:41,091
You can forget about
your bookshop!

177
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,303
No, the eggs are...

178
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,610
Scoundrel, I'll kill you!

179
00:10:57,967 --> 00:11:00,013
Out of the way!

180
00:11:06,363 --> 00:11:08,490
Good morning, princess

181
00:11:10,242 --> 00:11:13,203
I wonder if we'll ever bump
into each other standing up!

182
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:16,039
Excuse me, but I've got to run

183
00:11:16,373 --> 00:11:18,208
Farewell, princess!

184
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:34,433
- Chicken.
- That's easy

185
00:11:35,142 --> 00:11:37,936
It's served whole,
bottom down on the plate

186
00:11:38,187 --> 00:11:39,507
Will you cut it
for me? Naturally

187
00:11:39,646 --> 00:11:42,316
I hold it in place with the
blade stuck under the wing...

188
00:11:42,566 --> 00:11:44,109
then I rip off the drumstick

189
00:11:44,484 --> 00:11:46,444
I cut the meat along the
bottom of the breastbone

190
00:11:46,695 --> 00:11:48,280
Off go the wings,
breast and skin

191
00:11:48,488 --> 00:11:49,573
Lobster

192
00:11:49,781 --> 00:11:51,200
Piece of cake, Uncle Eliseo

193
00:11:51,491 --> 00:11:53,702
I stick the wing
under the leg...

194
00:11:53,952 --> 00:11:57,372
off goes the leg, I rip off
the lobster... stick the...

195
00:11:57,831 --> 00:12:01,251
Lobster is a crustacean

196
00:12:01,835 --> 00:12:03,837
Off goes the crust...

197
00:12:04,004 --> 00:12:05,505
of the crustacean

198
00:12:05,756 --> 00:12:10,385
Off go the crust and antennae. We
don't eat the antennae, now do we?

199
00:12:10,928 --> 00:12:13,472
Off go the antennae, off
goes the lobster...

200
00:12:13,972 --> 00:12:15,515
There's nothing left

201
00:12:15,724 --> 00:12:18,769
We're out of lobster, but we
have some delicious chicken

202
00:12:19,311 --> 00:12:21,522
I can't remember
how to do lobster

203
00:12:21,647 --> 00:12:23,981
It's served fresh
from the kitchen

204
00:12:23,982 --> 00:12:25,526
There's no need to touch it!

205
00:12:26,026 --> 00:12:28,862
That's too easy, that's
why I didn't remember

206
00:12:29,112 --> 00:12:30,656
- Continue!
- Behavior!

207
00:12:30,781 --> 00:12:32,407
Stand by. Still, like this

208
00:12:32,741 --> 00:12:34,326
"Waiter!" "Yes?"

209
00:12:34,493 --> 00:12:37,663
In position. Stand-by
behavior. "Waiter!"

210
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:48,257
Why are they all calling me? There
must be other waiters, right?

211
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:52,553
Bowing! Piece of cake

212
00:12:54,137 --> 00:12:56,890
You bow down farther

213
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:01,061
Like this. At a 45 degree angle,
just like a champagne bottle

214
00:13:01,228 --> 00:13:04,314
45 degrees, even 50, 55...

215
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:07,526
90 degrees, a right
angle. 180...

216
00:13:07,651 --> 00:13:10,821
How far do I bow down,
180 degrees? Like this?

217
00:13:11,154 --> 00:13:14,157
Think of sunflowers,
they bow to the sun

218
00:13:14,366 --> 00:13:16,743
But if you see some that
are too bowed down...

219
00:13:16,952 --> 00:13:20,622
it means they're dead! You're
serving, you're not a servant

220
00:13:21,081 --> 00:13:23,750
Serving is a supreme art

221
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:25,544
God is the first servant

222
00:13:26,253 --> 00:13:28,797
God serves men, but he's
not a servant to men!

223
00:13:29,715 --> 00:13:33,552
- There was no button here -
It doesn't go there, silly!

224
00:13:34,011 --> 00:13:36,555
I have to take the car back to
my dad, he's counting on it

225
00:13:36,805 --> 00:13:38,807
You'll take it back
in a month or so

226
00:13:39,016 --> 00:13:42,519
No, I've got to get it
back soon. You know why?

227
00:13:42,978 --> 00:13:44,313
Why?

228
00:13:51,361 --> 00:13:54,865
- What? What time is it?
- The time! Were you sleeping?

229
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,241
Of course I was!

230
00:13:56,867 --> 00:14:00,287
You asked me a question, you
turned your head and went to sleep

231
00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:02,372
- How did you do that?
- Schopenhauer

232
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,040
Who?

233
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,086
Schopenhauer says that with
willpower, you can do anything

234
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,047
"I am what I want to be"

235
00:14:10,422 --> 00:14:13,926
Right now I want to be someone who's
sleeping and I was saying to myself:

236
00:14:14,134 --> 00:14:16,254
"I'm sleeping, sleeping,
sleeping." And I fell asleep

237
00:14:16,762 --> 00:14:19,139
Amazing. And it's simple too

238
00:14:19,431 --> 00:14:20,431
I want to try too

239
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:24,603
I'm sleeping,
sleeping, sleeping...

240
00:14:24,728 --> 00:14:27,981
Don't move your hands,
you're not a juggler!

241
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:31,235
It's a matter of thought, it's
serious, and plus it takes time

242
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,195
We'll talk about it tomorrow

243
00:14:34,404 --> 00:14:35,989
Amazing, though

244
00:14:38,075 --> 00:14:39,159
Wake up

245
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:44,790
Wake up

246
00:14:44,998 --> 00:14:46,458
What is it now?
What are you doing?

247
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:48,794
- It totally works!
- What works?

248
00:14:49,127 --> 00:14:52,214
Schopenhauer! You know what
I just said? "Wake up!"

249
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:55,842
Bam! You woke up This
theory is incredible

250
00:14:56,218 --> 00:14:58,679
- How does this all happen?
- You were yelling in my ear!

251
00:14:58,845 --> 00:15:00,347
That's why I woke up!

252
00:15:01,974 --> 00:15:05,143
- So I should say it quieter.
- You don't say it at all!

253
00:15:05,394 --> 00:15:06,594
Ah, I'm not supposed to say it

254
00:15:08,897 --> 00:15:11,441
It's deep, you have to think it

255
00:15:15,654 --> 00:15:17,656
Why are you running? Slow down!

256
00:15:17,781 --> 00:15:19,241
Hurry up, it's late!

257
00:15:19,408 --> 00:15:21,076
Mary, the key!

258
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:25,747
Every morning she throws the key

259
00:15:26,123 --> 00:15:27,207
Look!

260
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:30,127
There's that teacher!
Boy, is she pretty!

261
00:15:30,252 --> 00:15:31,336
I even dreamt about her

262
00:15:31,545 --> 00:15:33,547
Come with me, I'll introduce you

263
00:15:33,755 --> 00:15:36,216
- Holy smokes! Stay still!
- What's wrong?

264
00:15:36,466 --> 00:15:38,010
Don't move!

265
00:15:38,886 --> 00:15:41,763
The one in the car. He's that jerk
the eggs fell on, the town clerk

266
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,391
He'll kill me if he
sees me! Be good

267
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,727
- What's he doing?
- He's standing there talking

268
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,937
- What's he saying?
- How do I know?

269
00:15:49,229 --> 00:15:52,816
- What's he doing?
- He's saying goodbye. He's leaving

270
00:15:53,275 --> 00:15:54,651
He's got a car just like mine!

271
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,360
There he is!

272
00:15:56,486 --> 00:15:58,697
Don't move, he'll kill
me if he sees me!

273
00:15:59,615 --> 00:16:01,450
Stay still, Ferruccio

274
00:16:04,369 --> 00:16:06,747
Good morning, princess!

275
00:16:08,582 --> 00:16:11,585
It's you again! How
do you do this?

276
00:16:12,044 --> 00:16:15,130
This is the princess who fell
from the sky into my arms

277
00:16:15,464 --> 00:16:18,217
Is he the one who sucked the
stinger out of your thigh?

278
00:16:18,383 --> 00:16:22,846
Yes. We keep meeting like this.
You just suddenly show up

279
00:16:23,305 --> 00:16:25,766
We could make plans to meet

280
00:16:26,308 --> 00:16:28,185
- Tonight at 8:00?
- No, it's nicer this way

281
00:16:28,477 --> 00:16:30,354
Let's go Dora, you'll be late

282
00:16:32,189 --> 00:16:34,942
I hope we meet again suddenly

283
00:16:35,275 --> 00:16:36,944
Farewell, princess!

284
00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:40,322
Did you see her?
She's pretty, huh?

285
00:16:40,614 --> 00:16:42,366
She likes it when
I suddenly appear

286
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,502
I don't believe it

287
00:16:53,086 --> 00:16:55,630
"Darkness"

288
00:16:56,506 --> 00:16:57,966
You're a genius!

289
00:16:58,299 --> 00:17:00,510
"The more there is,
the less you see"

290
00:17:00,677 --> 00:17:02,136
Solution: Darkness

291
00:17:02,637 --> 00:17:03,637
Marvelous

292
00:17:04,013 --> 00:17:05,848
Did you make that up?

293
00:17:06,057 --> 00:17:10,103
No, but you solved it in five
minutes, it took me eight days

294
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,688
Darkness!

295
00:17:12,438 --> 00:17:14,983
Salmon, salad and a
glass of white wine

296
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:17,402
Listen to this one, Guido

297
00:17:17,944 --> 00:17:20,154
If I may, it's my turn

298
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:23,116
My dad told me this
when I was a kid

299
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:26,536
Show White and the seven
dwarves sit down for a bite

300
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:29,706
How fast can you guess what
she serves her guests next?

301
00:17:33,877 --> 00:17:35,670
It sounds refined

302
00:17:36,671 --> 00:17:38,548
I want to solve it right now

303
00:17:38,673 --> 00:17:40,049
Eat first or it'll get cold

304
00:17:40,216 --> 00:17:42,051
I don't want to, it's too late

305
00:17:42,135 --> 00:17:44,512
Salad, salmon, white
wine, it's light

306
00:17:44,721 --> 00:17:46,347
Snow White...

307
00:17:47,348 --> 00:17:49,267
and the seven dwarves...

308
00:17:53,021 --> 00:17:55,732
- Is the kitchen closed?
- Everybody's gone. Why?

309
00:17:56,065 --> 00:17:59,319
A gentleman from Rome is here,
from the Ministry. He wants to eat

310
00:17:59,569 --> 00:18:00,569
The kitchen is closed

311
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,114
Oh well, he would have
given you a good tip

312
00:18:03,364 --> 00:18:05,074
The kitchen is open

313
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,243
Come right in

314
00:18:16,502 --> 00:18:18,546
Doctor, you're not
eating anything?

315
00:18:21,466 --> 00:18:23,218
Snow White and the
seven dwarves...

316
00:18:25,178 --> 00:18:29,182
I know the kitchen is closed,
maybe a cold dish...

317
00:18:29,265 --> 00:18:31,267
It's all delicious,
take your pick

318
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:33,436
Something light

319
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,523
Well, we've got meat,
a nice heavy steak...

320
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:39,567
lamb, kidneys, some
greasy breaded liver

321
00:18:39,776 --> 00:18:41,444
Otherwise, there's fish

322
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:43,988
We have...

323
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,532
a nice fatty turbot...

324
00:18:45,782 --> 00:18:48,451
eel stuffed with fatty sausage and
greased with Grand Marnier...

325
00:18:49,285 --> 00:18:51,412
or some lean salmon

326
00:18:51,955 --> 00:18:53,957
The salmon, thank you

327
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:55,207
Side dish?

328
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:56,709
There's a side dish too?

329
00:18:57,835 --> 00:19:01,089
Feel free to choose. We have very,
very, very fried mushrooms...

330
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:04,884
buttered potatoes in Nancy
butter with a flaky sauce

331
00:19:05,176 --> 00:19:09,722
Is there a small, light
salad? If not, nothing

332
00:19:10,265 --> 00:19:14,644
A light salad? What a pity, the
very, very, very fried mushrooms...

333
00:19:14,852 --> 00:19:17,354
were out of this world.
So, a light salad...

334
00:19:17,355 --> 00:19:19,899
a lean salmon and a
glass of white wine

335
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,860
Perfect. As soon as possible

336
00:19:22,068 --> 00:19:23,611
I'll do my best

337
00:19:40,295 --> 00:19:43,631
"How fast can you guess what
she served her guests next?"

338
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:44,798
Right?

339
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:48,595
- Snow White and the seven dwarves!
- Good night, Doctor!

340
00:19:48,761 --> 00:19:50,388
Good night, genius!

341
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:56,269
What did he say? Snow
white? What is he, drunk?

342
00:19:56,769 --> 00:19:58,980
It's a riddle. "Seven seconds"

343
00:20:00,857 --> 00:20:04,277
"Seven seconds" is the solution time
"Snow White and the seven dwarves"

344
00:20:04,402 --> 00:20:06,446
If there are seven
dwarves dining...

345
00:20:06,613 --> 00:20:09,282
and she serves seconds,
that means "seven seconds"

346
00:20:09,699 --> 00:20:13,745
Doctor Lessing is a physician,
a very serious person

347
00:20:14,037 --> 00:20:17,290
But he's obsessed with riddles,
he loses sleep over them!

348
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:23,254
Excuse me, the Francesco
Petrarca School...

349
00:20:24,297 --> 00:20:27,967
The elementary school? A friend of
mine teaches there. It's beautiful

350
00:20:28,218 --> 00:20:29,802
It's not far from here. Why?

351
00:20:30,094 --> 00:20:32,847
Good, I can sleep
an extra half-hour

352
00:20:33,056 --> 00:20:35,600
Do you have to go to that
school tomorrow morning?

353
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:38,436
They're expecting me at 8:30

354
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:48,112
Please, children, silence!
A moment of attention

355
00:20:48,321 --> 00:20:50,865
The Inspector from Rome
will be here shortly

356
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:53,493
I want to make a good
impression on him

357
00:20:53,701 --> 00:20:57,454
Listen very quietly and
carefully to what he says

358
00:20:57,455 --> 00:21:00,625
He'll tell us some very important
things about our beautiful country

359
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:04,045
The inspector is here, ma'am

360
00:21:04,337 --> 00:21:06,798
He's already here? He's early!

361
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:08,925
Sit down, Roberto!

362
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:15,431
All rise!

363
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:21,563
Good morning, princess

364
00:21:24,732 --> 00:21:28,236
Good morning, Mr. Inspector.
I'm the principal

365
00:21:28,528 --> 00:21:30,572
These are some of our teachers

366
00:21:33,199 --> 00:21:34,200
Good

367
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:38,079
So...

368
00:21:40,373 --> 00:21:43,960
How many years have you taught
in this school district?

369
00:21:44,085 --> 00:21:45,086
Sixteen

370
00:21:47,505 --> 00:21:50,507
Are you up-to-date
with the ongoing...

371
00:21:50,508 --> 00:21:52,719
school program approved by
the Ministry this year?

372
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:54,012
Yes

373
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,851
Did you read the bulletin
regarding childhood hygiene?

374
00:22:00,476 --> 00:22:01,895
Of course!

375
00:22:04,564 --> 00:22:06,232
What are you doing on Sunday?

376
00:22:07,692 --> 00:22:08,860
No, I mean, Sunday...

377
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,447
is St. Mary's Day,
what are you doing?

378
00:22:12,572 --> 00:22:13,823
I'm going to the theater

379
00:22:16,534 --> 00:22:18,828
- To see what?
- Offenbach

380
00:22:19,829 --> 00:22:21,206
Right, Offenbach is playing

381
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:23,833
Fine. Well...

382
00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:30,339
Thank you very much and
goodbye. I just came to...

383
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,424
We know

384
00:22:32,175 --> 00:22:34,219
As you know, the Inspector...

385
00:22:34,385 --> 00:22:37,472
came from Rome to talk to us
about the race manifesto...

386
00:22:37,598 --> 00:22:40,684
signed by the most enlightened
Italian scientists

387
00:22:41,143 --> 00:22:43,812
He will, and we're
very honored...

388
00:22:44,104 --> 00:22:46,106
demonstrate to us
that our race...

389
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:48,192
is a superior race...

390
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:50,402
the best of all

391
00:22:51,111 --> 00:22:52,196
Take your seats!

392
00:22:54,949 --> 00:22:56,325
Go ahead, Inspector

393
00:22:56,492 --> 00:22:59,578
- Our race...
- Is superior

394
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,288
Naturally!

395
00:23:02,706 --> 00:23:04,666
Our race is superior

396
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:07,794
I've just come from Rome,
right this minute...

397
00:23:07,795 --> 00:23:12,007
to come and tell you in order
that you'll know, children...

398
00:23:12,508 --> 00:23:14,343
that our race is a superior one

399
00:23:14,552 --> 00:23:15,803
I was...

400
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,973
chosen, I was, by racist
Italian scientists...

401
00:23:19,139 --> 00:23:21,600
in order to demonstrate...

402
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:24,853
how superior our race is

403
00:23:25,563 --> 00:23:29,483
Why did they pick me, children?

404
00:23:30,734 --> 00:23:32,945
Must I tell you?

405
00:23:35,823 --> 00:23:37,741
Where can you find...

406
00:23:37,867 --> 00:23:40,536
someone more handsome than me?

407
00:23:41,495 --> 00:23:46,041
Justly so, there is silence. I'm
an original "superior race"...

408
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:47,543
pure Aryan

409
00:23:48,335 --> 00:23:49,335
Children...

410
00:23:49,545 --> 00:23:51,588
let's start with something that one
says, "What so big about that?"

411
00:23:51,589 --> 00:23:55,718
The ear. Look at the
perfection of this ear

412
00:23:56,218 --> 00:23:57,678
Left auricle...

413
00:23:58,345 --> 00:24:01,307
with a pendant little
bell at the end

414
00:24:01,682 --> 00:24:04,351
Check it out! Movable cartilage!

415
00:24:04,685 --> 00:24:05,769
Bendable!

416
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:08,814
Find two ears more beautiful
than these and I'll leave!

417
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:12,651
But you have to show me them!
They dream about these in France!

418
00:24:13,027 --> 00:24:15,487
Races exist, children.
You bet they do!

419
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:19,408
But let's continue, I want
to show you something else

420
00:24:20,451 --> 00:24:21,451
Pay attention

421
00:24:22,244 --> 00:24:23,996
He said, "Inspector"?

422
00:24:24,622 --> 00:24:25,873
From Rome?

423
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:30,085
The belly button!

424
00:24:32,046 --> 00:24:35,090
Take a look at this belly
button! What a tie!

425
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:37,468
But you can't untie it,
not even with your teeth!

426
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:40,638
Those racist scientists
tried it. Not a chance!

427
00:24:40,804 --> 00:24:44,058
This is an Italian belly
button. It's part of our race!

428
00:24:44,308 --> 00:24:45,809
Check out this style!

429
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:48,562
Look at these muscles: Ceps...

430
00:24:48,729 --> 00:24:50,773
biceps, triceps!

431
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:54,860
Look at this beauty!
Admire this hip!

432
00:24:57,988 --> 00:25:01,242
Just look at the movement!

433
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:02,535
Gentlemen!

434
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,747
I must say goodbye now...

435
00:25:06,956 --> 00:25:09,792
because I have to go,
I have an appointment

436
00:25:10,084 --> 00:25:13,087
I'll make my Aryan exit
and bid you farewell

437
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:15,506
Farewell! The belly button!

438
00:25:17,925 --> 00:25:20,219
I'll see you in
Venice, princess!

439
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,743
I can only hear out of this ear

440
00:26:43,594 --> 00:26:46,347
Look at me, princess

441
00:26:47,765 --> 00:26:49,892
Go on, I'm down here

442
00:26:50,768 --> 00:26:57,149
Look at me, princess

443
00:27:09,578 --> 00:27:12,831
Turn around, princess

444
00:27:13,749 --> 00:27:21,090
Turn around, around...

445
00:27:53,122 --> 00:27:56,292
- Can we get a chocolate ice cream?
- Yes, but we'll have to be quick

446
00:27:56,584 --> 00:27:57,584
Why?

447
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:02,423
We have to be at the prefect's
at 8. We were invited to dinner

448
00:28:02,506 --> 00:28:04,383
- Where?
- At the prefect's

449
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,137
Have pity on me, Lord,
let it not be true

450
00:28:08,262 --> 00:28:10,263
Another dinner at the prefect's?

451
00:28:10,264 --> 00:28:11,515
Your mother is coming too

452
00:28:11,765 --> 00:28:12,850
Bingo!

453
00:28:13,475 --> 00:28:17,062
Let's just go to dinner. We'll
stop by the prefect's for coffee

454
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:19,523
I'm not coming!

455
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:22,110
All right, I heard you! I'll
tell him we're not going!

456
00:28:22,277 --> 00:28:24,112
It'll just be me and you

457
00:28:26,239 --> 00:28:29,284
- Good evening, Rodolfo!
- Good evening, Mr. Prefect

458
00:28:29,534 --> 00:28:32,495
I'll see you later on at my
house. I'll expect you at eight

459
00:28:32,621 --> 00:28:34,998
We'll be there at eight sharp

460
00:28:39,502 --> 00:28:41,379
Where is she? Did you see her?

461
00:28:41,963 --> 00:28:44,174
- She has to be here.
- You're here?

462
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,761
On time tomorrow, got it?

463
00:28:48,303 --> 00:28:50,971
Did you take that
stuff out of the car?

464
00:28:50,972 --> 00:28:53,725
It's silk, don't ruin
it. Be very careful

465
00:28:55,393 --> 00:28:57,687
- What an opera.
- Beautiful!

466
00:29:00,357 --> 00:29:02,234
Is that one of your curtains?

467
00:29:02,442 --> 00:29:06,029
No, it must be one
of my colleague's

468
00:29:08,949 --> 00:29:11,159
He took my hat again!

469
00:29:11,743 --> 00:29:14,412
- Let's go.
- Don't you see how it's raining?

470
00:29:14,746 --> 00:29:17,999
- You go get the car!
- It's right around the corner

471
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:19,833
All right, you wait here

472
00:29:20,085 --> 00:29:22,128
I'll pull up right here and toot

473
00:29:23,964 --> 00:29:26,007
Give me the key!

474
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:29,010
Not the house key, the car key!

475
00:29:30,136 --> 00:29:31,888
The car key? Are you crazy?

476
00:29:32,138 --> 00:29:35,016
Keep him busy, you know,
the jerk the eggs fell on

477
00:29:35,308 --> 00:29:37,686
Keep him busy as long as you
can, I'll see you tonight!

478
00:29:37,811 --> 00:29:39,854
Inside the car
there's... Go slow!

479
00:29:57,122 --> 00:29:59,602
The least you could have done is
come get me with the umbrella

480
00:29:59,666 --> 00:30:03,253
You're just plain rude.
Look what a mess I am

481
00:30:03,336 --> 00:30:06,673
Plus, dinner at the prefect's
gets me so nervous!

482
00:30:07,924 --> 00:30:10,468
I knew it, I've got hiccups

483
00:30:11,011 --> 00:30:13,930
I always get them when I'm made
to do something I don't want to

484
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:17,976
Don't you know that it takes
so little to make me happy?

485
00:30:18,268 --> 00:30:21,354
A chocolate ice cream
is enough! Even two!

486
00:30:21,479 --> 00:30:24,274
A nice walk together and then
whatever happens, happens

487
00:30:24,524 --> 00:30:25,692
Instead you...

488
00:30:28,069 --> 00:30:30,113
Good morning, princess!

489
00:30:31,489 --> 00:30:34,576
This is incredible! You
owe me an explanation

490
00:30:34,784 --> 00:30:36,828
No, you're the one who
owes me an explanation!

491
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,707
I stop under a roof and you
fall from the sky into my arms

492
00:30:40,999 --> 00:30:43,376
I fall off my bicycle
and end up in your arms

493
00:30:43,877 --> 00:30:47,547
I do an inspection at school
and there you are again!

494
00:30:48,089 --> 00:30:50,050
You even turn up in my dreams!

495
00:30:50,342 --> 00:30:54,429
Will you leave me alone! You've
really got a crush on me!

496
00:30:54,888 --> 00:30:57,182
I don't blame you, but...

497
00:30:57,849 --> 00:31:00,518
All right, at this point,
I give in. You win

498
00:31:00,602 --> 00:31:03,355
Where shall we go, princess? To
the sea! Do you like the sea?

499
00:31:03,563 --> 00:31:06,733
Yes, but they're waiting for me
at the theater. Take me back

500
00:31:08,026 --> 00:31:09,402
What's happening?

501
00:31:09,611 --> 00:31:13,031
Princess, do you know how to
turn on the wind shield wipers?

502
00:31:13,406 --> 00:31:14,991
Step on the brakes!

503
00:31:16,409 --> 00:31:18,787
Have no fear, hang on to me!

504
00:31:19,829 --> 00:31:21,289
It's broken!

505
00:31:21,623 --> 00:31:23,208
When did you learn to drive?

506
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:26,378
- Ten minutes ago!
- I thought it was less than that

507
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:29,339
- The top doesn't close.
- The door won't open

508
00:31:29,798 --> 00:31:31,758
Wait, we're stuck!

509
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:34,469
We'll get out of here,
I'll take care of it

510
00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:37,097
The important thing is
that you don't get wet

511
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,432
Cover yourself with this

512
00:31:39,766 --> 00:31:41,810
Take it. We'll get
out of here now

513
00:31:42,602 --> 00:31:44,813
I'll take care of everything

514
00:31:46,773 --> 00:31:48,900
Here we go

515
00:31:49,651 --> 00:31:51,862
Step right out, princess

516
00:31:54,948 --> 00:31:57,826
There! Step right out!

517
00:31:57,993 --> 00:32:03,039
There's a huge puddle, you'll
get your feet wet. Wait!

518
00:32:05,917 --> 00:32:07,669
Here!

519
00:32:13,717 --> 00:32:16,678
- Go ahead, princess.
- Where are we?

520
00:32:16,845 --> 00:32:18,763
We've already been here

521
00:32:19,097 --> 00:32:20,807
Me and you? When?

522
00:32:21,057 --> 00:32:22,684
Don't you remember?

523
00:32:23,018 --> 00:32:24,477
The night it was raining...

524
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:27,147
and I made you an
umbrella out of a pillow!

525
00:32:27,272 --> 00:32:30,942
It was a beautiful night, I put the
steering wheel on my shoulder...

526
00:32:31,234 --> 00:32:35,155
did a little waltz and when I
stopped in front of you...

527
00:32:35,405 --> 00:32:36,405
you kissed me

528
00:32:47,334 --> 00:32:49,794
Princess, your behind
is exposed to the wind

529
00:32:53,715 --> 00:32:57,302
It depends on the person.
My pop was like that

530
00:32:57,719 --> 00:33:00,597
He had the ability to
make me do anything

531
00:33:00,805 --> 00:33:03,224
He understood me, he
knew how to deal with me

532
00:33:03,225 --> 00:33:05,435
I was like putty in his hand

533
00:33:05,602 --> 00:33:08,480
I always, always,
always said yes

534
00:33:08,897 --> 00:33:12,150
So all these treasures
you're hiding...

535
00:33:12,484 --> 00:33:17,113
there is a way to open this treasure
chest and always get you to say yes!

536
00:33:17,364 --> 00:33:19,241
It's easier than you think

537
00:33:19,574 --> 00:33:21,451
All you need is the right key

538
00:33:21,618 --> 00:33:22,869
And where exactly is it?

539
00:33:23,036 --> 00:33:24,538
Heaven knows

540
00:33:25,205 --> 00:33:26,790
It's clearing up

541
00:33:26,957 --> 00:33:28,750
So you were saying...

542
00:33:28,917 --> 00:33:33,004
the key that always makes you
say yes has to come from heaven

543
00:33:33,129 --> 00:33:34,130
Yes

544
00:33:34,714 --> 00:33:36,091
I'll give it a try

545
00:33:36,508 --> 00:33:40,428
If the Virgin Mary tosses it
down to me... You never know

546
00:33:41,513 --> 00:33:43,515
Mary, the key!

547
00:33:45,892 --> 00:33:47,519
Is this it?

548
00:33:49,813 --> 00:33:53,233
Do you really have to go home? What
about the chocolate ice cream?

549
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,040
- Let's get it right now.
- No, not now

550
00:33:55,235 --> 00:33:57,279
- Then when?
- I don't know

551
00:33:57,904 --> 00:34:00,365
Are we going to let
heaven decide that too?

552
00:34:00,574 --> 00:34:04,703
No, leave Mary alone. Don't
bother her over an ice cream!

553
00:34:05,538 --> 00:34:08,708
No, it's much too important. We
can't decide when to have it

554
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:10,585
I have to ask her

555
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:15,965
Mary send someone to tell us how long
before we can have the ice cream!

556
00:34:18,009 --> 00:34:19,844
Seven seconds!

557
00:34:24,891 --> 00:34:27,685
- This is my house.
- I've gone by here a thousand times

558
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:30,396
I've always asked myself,
"Who lives there?"

559
00:34:30,605 --> 00:34:32,481
I wanted to open my
store right out front

560
00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:35,776
- The bookshop?
- Yes, I'll see you every day

561
00:34:35,902 --> 00:34:37,153
Goodbye, then

562
00:34:37,528 --> 00:34:41,282
You've been so nice to me.
All I want now is a hot bath

563
00:34:41,532 --> 00:34:43,451
I forgot to tell you...

564
00:34:44,368 --> 00:34:45,369
Go ahead

565
00:34:45,953 --> 00:34:48,998
You can't imagine how much I
feel like making love to you

566
00:34:50,124 --> 00:34:53,044
But I'll never tell anyone,
especially not you

567
00:34:53,377 --> 00:34:55,838
They'd have to torture
me to make me say it

568
00:34:56,464 --> 00:34:57,465
Say what?

569
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,675
That I want to make love to you

570
00:34:59,842 --> 00:35:02,136
Not just once, over
and over again!

571
00:35:02,637 --> 00:35:04,180
But I'll never tell you that

572
00:35:04,347 --> 00:35:07,433
I'd have to be crazy to tell you
I'd even make love to you now...

573
00:35:07,725 --> 00:35:09,936
right here, for the
rest of my life

574
00:35:12,271 --> 00:35:14,815
You'd better run or you'll get
wet. It's going to rain again

575
00:35:16,025 --> 00:35:17,025
Princess

576
00:35:17,568 --> 00:35:18,985
You're all wet

577
00:35:18,986 --> 00:35:20,488
My suit is no big deal

578
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,616
It's the hat that bothers me

579
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:26,827
I need a dry hat, but
where can I find one?

580
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:30,623
How did it go? Right, it's easy!

581
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:35,503
Mary, send someone to
give my friend a dry hat

582
00:35:43,553 --> 00:35:45,596
Goodnight, princess. Farewell

583
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,451
Excuse me, where's the restroom?

584
00:36:07,743 --> 00:36:08,911
Straight ahead to the left

585
00:36:17,003 --> 00:36:19,714
If you don't get
up immediately...

586
00:36:19,922 --> 00:36:23,759
I swear on your father's death bed
I'll never speak to you again

587
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:25,386
For the rest of my life!

588
00:36:26,762 --> 00:36:28,347
I'm going to count to three now

589
00:36:28,723 --> 00:36:31,767
If you don't get up,
I'll force you to get up

590
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:47,283
Good girl

591
00:36:47,867 --> 00:36:49,744
Do you know who's
getting married?

592
00:36:49,994 --> 00:36:52,538
Didn't I tell you? That
jerk the eggs fell on!

593
00:36:56,459 --> 00:36:58,836
- Who's he marrying?
- I don't know

594
00:36:59,045 --> 00:37:00,922
But she hasn't
even shown up yet!

595
00:37:01,214 --> 00:37:02,673
Everybody's waiting

596
00:37:03,049 --> 00:37:05,176
I've looked everywhere for you!

597
00:37:05,676 --> 00:37:07,178
- Your uncle!
- My uncle?

598
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,347
Something's happened.
Come with me!

599
00:37:09,513 --> 00:37:10,765
Outside! The horse!

600
00:37:14,185 --> 00:37:15,770
What is that?

601
00:37:16,687 --> 00:37:18,105
Is that your horse?

602
00:37:18,731 --> 00:37:21,901
What a sight! What did
they write on him?

603
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,237
"Achtung, Jewish horse"

604
00:37:25,029 --> 00:37:29,158
The usual barbarians, vandals.
It's sad. What nonsense

605
00:37:30,076 --> 00:37:31,160
"Jewish horse!"

606
00:37:31,494 --> 00:37:34,747
Don't get upset, they
just did it to...

607
00:37:34,872 --> 00:37:38,376
They didn't just happen
to do it, they did it...

608
00:37:39,335 --> 00:37:41,546
You'll have to get
used to it, Guido...

609
00:37:41,796 --> 00:37:43,421
they'll start with you too

610
00:37:43,422 --> 00:37:46,676
With me? What could
possibly happen to me?

611
00:37:46,842 --> 00:37:49,362
The worst they can do is undress
me, paint me yellow and write:

612
00:37:49,804 --> 00:37:51,806
"Achtung, Jewish waiter."

613
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,184
I didn't even know
this horse was Jewish

614
00:37:55,434 --> 00:37:57,812
Let's go, I'll clean
him up in the morning

615
00:37:58,229 --> 00:37:59,897
Take him back to the stall

616
00:38:18,207 --> 00:38:20,585
Look, there in front of you!

617
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:28,593
Wait, I'll surprise her

618
00:38:38,352 --> 00:38:40,813
Come with me, I'd like to
introduce you to Fido Giovanardi

619
00:38:51,574 --> 00:38:54,535
Doctor Lessing! Where
are you going?

620
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:59,332
Urgent telegram. I must
go to Berlin immediately

621
00:38:59,999 --> 00:39:04,212
- What are these flowers?
- They're for your departure

622
00:39:05,171 --> 00:39:07,298
I'll take just one

623
00:39:08,049 --> 00:39:10,718
I'll take it to my
wife. Guido's flower!

624
00:39:12,303 --> 00:39:14,597
I truly enjoyed myself with you

625
00:39:14,805 --> 00:39:16,641
You're the most ingenious...

626
00:39:16,807 --> 00:39:19,018
waiter I've ever come across

627
00:39:19,602 --> 00:39:22,772
Thank you. You're the most-cultured
customer I've ever served

628
00:39:23,356 --> 00:39:24,356
Thank you

629
00:39:24,941 --> 00:39:26,442
Goodbye, Doctor Lessing

630
00:39:26,901 --> 00:39:28,653
By the way...

631
00:39:30,613 --> 00:39:32,490
if you say my name...

632
00:39:33,366 --> 00:39:36,285
I'm not there anymore. Who am I?

633
00:39:37,912 --> 00:39:41,249
If you say my name,
I'm not there anymore

634
00:39:44,835 --> 00:39:46,796
What is it? What did he say?

635
00:39:49,174 --> 00:39:50,926
Silence!

636
00:39:51,885 --> 00:39:55,389
Beautiful! If you say the word,
it's not there anymore: Silence

637
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,186
I'm not talking about Berlin.
In the outskirts, imagine that!

638
00:40:02,854 --> 00:40:05,524
Third grade, listen
to this problem

639
00:40:05,983 --> 00:40:08,317
I remember it because
it shocked me

640
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:11,989
A lunatic costs the
State four marks a day

641
00:40:12,322 --> 00:40:14,449
A cripple, four and a half marks

642
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,870
An epileptic, three
marks and a half

643
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,081
Considering that the average
is four marks a day...

644
00:40:21,164 --> 00:40:23,499
and there are 300,000 patients,
how much would the State save...

645
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:27,337
if these individuals
were eliminated?

646
00:40:27,921 --> 00:40:29,464
I can't believe this!

647
00:40:30,465 --> 00:40:32,509
That was my exact reaction!

648
00:40:32,676 --> 00:40:35,220
I can't believe a
seven-year-old child...

649
00:40:35,721 --> 00:40:37,848
has to solve this
kind of equation

650
00:40:38,348 --> 00:40:41,726
It's a difficult calculation.
Proportions, percentages...

651
00:40:41,727 --> 00:40:44,521
They need at least some
algebra to do those equations

652
00:40:44,646 --> 00:40:46,440
That's high school
material for us

653
00:40:46,773 --> 00:40:50,861
No, all it takes is multiplication!
You said there are 300,000 cripples?

654
00:40:51,904 --> 00:40:53,155
300,000 times four

655
00:40:53,363 --> 00:40:56,867
If we killed them all, we'd
save 1,200,000 marks a day

656
00:40:56,992 --> 00:40:57,993
It's easy!

657
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,660
Exactly!

658
00:40:59,953 --> 00:41:04,249
But you're an adult, they make
7-year-old children do this in Germany!

659
00:41:04,708 --> 00:41:06,835
They're truly another race!

660
00:41:09,796 --> 00:41:11,506
Good morning, princess!

661
00:41:12,507 --> 00:41:16,345
- What did you say?
- It's here, on the cake

662
00:41:35,572 --> 00:41:38,242
Why are you just standing
there? Let's go!

663
00:41:38,742 --> 00:41:40,869
Let's go dance

664
00:42:15,988 --> 00:42:19,074
Just a couple things, you
already know it all by now...

665
00:42:19,283 --> 00:42:21,243
and you've known
for several years

666
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:24,204
Dora and I were born
on the same street...

667
00:42:24,913 --> 00:42:28,166
We went to school together,
we had the same friends

668
00:42:30,502 --> 00:42:32,045
Dora is the woman of my life...

669
00:42:32,379 --> 00:42:34,590
and I am the man of her life

670
00:42:34,756 --> 00:42:38,677
We've decided to get
married within the year

671
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,555
You're all officially
invited on April the 9th...

672
00:42:41,722 --> 00:42:44,016
to the Basilica of Santa
Maria del Pellegrino...

673
00:42:44,141 --> 00:42:48,102
and then we'll celebrate till
dawn, all together right here...

674
00:42:48,103 --> 00:42:50,480
just as happy as we are now!

675
00:42:57,738 --> 00:43:00,282
Kiss her! Kiss her!

676
00:43:05,787 --> 00:43:07,831
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing

677
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:09,750
- Are you all right?
- Fine

678
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,961
Who put this armchair here?

679
00:43:13,837 --> 00:43:15,088
Are you all right?

680
00:43:15,297 --> 00:43:16,965
- I'm fine - I'm sorry

681
00:43:17,466 --> 00:43:19,346
- I didn't get hurt -
No, I was talking about

682
00:43:19,551 --> 00:43:22,012
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- It's going fine

683
00:43:22,095 --> 00:43:23,805
Go back to your table

684
00:43:24,181 --> 00:43:26,225
Go on, I can do this

685
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,152
Are you all right?

686
00:43:38,028 --> 00:43:42,324
Fine! Why are you all asking me
that? Is there something wrong?

687
00:43:42,658 --> 00:43:45,494
No, nothing is wrong

688
00:43:45,702 --> 00:43:48,247
But go to the kitchen

689
00:43:52,501 --> 00:43:53,877
The kitchen

690
00:43:55,003 --> 00:43:58,048
They moved everything
around tonight!

691
00:43:58,131 --> 00:44:00,050
Look where they put the kitchen!

692
00:44:09,601 --> 00:44:12,271
Peekaboo, guess who?

693
00:44:12,854 --> 00:44:14,898
It's me! What, have
you gone soft?

694
00:44:16,775 --> 00:44:17,776
Miss!

695
00:44:18,527 --> 00:44:20,320
We finally meet, Dora

696
00:44:21,154 --> 00:44:24,825
He never introduced us. You
were scared to, weren't you?

697
00:44:25,325 --> 00:44:28,662
Now you don't need to come with
us to the brothel anymore!

698
00:44:29,538 --> 00:44:32,541
I apologize if I've disturbed you.
Happiness and best wishes to all

699
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:34,376
You sly old dog!

700
00:44:35,669 --> 00:44:37,546
What a jolly fellow!

701
00:44:42,634 --> 00:44:44,845
Everything is just fine.
I'll pick it all up

702
00:44:45,846 --> 00:44:47,097
I apologize

703
00:44:58,317 --> 00:44:59,484
Princess!

704
00:45:00,444 --> 00:45:01,987
You're here too?

705
00:45:15,834 --> 00:45:17,294
Take me away

706
00:45:33,061 --> 00:45:35,271
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

707
00:45:35,438 --> 00:45:38,858
a magnificent surprise
offered by the Grand Hotel:

708
00:45:39,651 --> 00:45:42,111
The Ethiopian cake!

709
00:46:35,999 --> 00:46:38,918
Thank you! Music, maestro!

710
00:46:43,756 --> 00:46:44,841
Congratulations

711
00:46:45,425 --> 00:46:46,425
Thank you

712
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:49,053
Right this way, princess

713
00:46:50,555 --> 00:46:51,806
But you're...

714
00:46:52,891 --> 00:46:54,767
Quickly, princess

715
00:47:15,997 --> 00:47:17,248
But he's...

716
00:47:21,669 --> 00:47:23,463
He's that jerk with the eggs!

717
00:47:58,957 --> 00:48:00,416
Ferruccio!

718
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:04,504
He's got the keys to
the house Darn it all!

719
00:48:08,925 --> 00:48:12,262
Some wire! I can open
it if I find some wire

720
00:48:13,388 --> 00:48:16,724
I'm a whiz with wire.
My pop taught me

721
00:48:17,058 --> 00:48:19,936
I used to make toys out
of wire when I was a kid

722
00:48:27,485 --> 00:48:29,195
I opened it

723
00:48:54,095 --> 00:48:58,391
Joshua!

724
00:49:01,185 --> 00:49:03,897
Let's go, you're going
to make Mommy late

725
00:49:08,234 --> 00:49:10,528
I lost my tank

726
00:49:10,945 --> 00:49:12,697
Don't worry, we'll find it

727
00:49:13,573 --> 00:49:15,617
Where did you leave the tank?

728
00:49:15,742 --> 00:49:17,660
- It's on the stairs
- I'll get it

729
00:49:18,203 --> 00:49:20,872
Hold the bicycle. I'll get it

730
00:49:23,958 --> 00:49:24,958
Here

731
00:49:26,294 --> 00:49:27,462
Let's go

732
00:49:28,713 --> 00:49:31,883
- Go, Pop!
- Go slow! Are you guys crazy?

733
00:49:32,217 --> 00:49:34,052
You're late for school! Go!

734
00:49:34,636 --> 00:49:37,805
There's a horse! Two horses!

735
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,477
Stop ringing that bell,
it's driving me crazy!

736
00:49:42,602 --> 00:49:46,356
- It's not me, it's Joshua.
- It's not me, it's Pop!

737
00:49:46,481 --> 00:49:48,066
Stop it, let me off!

738
00:49:58,243 --> 00:49:59,494
Here we are

739
00:50:00,078 --> 00:50:01,538
See you tonight

740
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,001
Go fast, Pop!

741
00:50:18,721 --> 00:50:20,932
Can we buy this for Mommy?

742
00:50:21,266 --> 00:50:22,934
- How much does it cost?
- 15 lire

743
00:50:23,643 --> 00:50:27,230
It's a fake. It's probably a
fake cake, like your tank

744
00:50:27,313 --> 00:50:28,565
Let's go, Joshua

745
00:50:29,107 --> 00:50:32,068
"No Jews or dogs...

746
00:50:32,318 --> 00:50:34,445
allowed."

747
00:50:36,072 --> 00:50:40,535
Why aren't Jews or
dogs allowed to go in?

748
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:43,288
They just don't want
Jews or dogs to go in

749
00:50:43,621 --> 00:50:45,164
Everybody does what they want to

750
00:50:45,498 --> 00:50:47,000
There's a hardware
store there...

751
00:50:47,417 --> 00:50:51,004
they don't let Spanish people
or horses into their store

752
00:50:51,337 --> 00:50:53,381
Farther ahead,
there's a drugstore

753
00:50:53,715 --> 00:50:56,275
I was with a Chinese friend of
mine yesterday who had a kangaroo

754
00:50:56,342 --> 00:50:59,220
I said "May we?" "No, we don't want
any Chinese or kangaroos here."

755
00:50:59,596 --> 00:51:01,598
They don't like them,
what can I tell you?

756
00:51:01,973 --> 00:51:04,350
We let everybody
into our bookshop

757
00:51:04,517 --> 00:51:06,728
No. From now on,
we'll write it too

758
00:51:06,978 --> 00:51:09,021
- Is there anybody you don't like?
- Spiders, what about you?

759
00:51:09,022 --> 00:51:11,316
I don't like Visigoths.
Starting tomorrow we'll write:

760
00:51:11,774 --> 00:51:14,319
"No spiders and
Visigoths allowed."

761
00:51:14,527 --> 00:51:18,031
I'm sick and tired
of these Visigoths!

762
00:51:26,081 --> 00:51:28,083
Good morning

763
00:51:28,167 --> 00:51:29,793
Everything's half-price

764
00:51:30,127 --> 00:51:31,295
Guido Orefice?

765
00:51:31,921 --> 00:51:33,339
That's me

766
00:51:33,672 --> 00:51:35,549
You have to come
to the prefect's

767
00:51:35,674 --> 00:51:36,842
Again!

768
00:51:37,426 --> 00:51:39,136
- He already went - Let's go

769
00:51:39,261 --> 00:51:40,596
Why?

770
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:45,434
- Is that man with you?
- Yes, let's go

771
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:47,311
All right

772
00:51:47,686 --> 00:51:49,021
I'm coming too

773
00:51:49,438 --> 00:51:51,732
You stay here. It won't
take long, will it?

774
00:51:51,899 --> 00:51:53,150
Not long at all

775
00:51:54,443 --> 00:51:57,196
Joshua, make sure you
treat the customers good!

776
00:51:57,905 --> 00:51:59,281
I'll be right back

777
00:53:02,303 --> 00:53:03,846
I'll take this one

778
00:53:04,054 --> 00:53:05,639
It costs five lire

779
00:53:05,764 --> 00:53:09,435
No, it says ten lire

780
00:53:09,685 --> 00:53:11,645
Everything's half-price

781
00:53:14,231 --> 00:53:17,484
Give this to your
mom and tell her...

782
00:53:17,651 --> 00:53:18,903
it's from Grandma

783
00:53:19,153 --> 00:53:22,323
I've never seen
my grandma before

784
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:23,908
Would you like to meet her?

785
00:53:24,283 --> 00:53:25,283
Yes

786
00:53:26,535 --> 00:53:28,537
You'll meet her tomorrow

787
00:53:28,746 --> 00:53:29,830
Tomorrow?

788
00:53:30,164 --> 00:53:32,708
Because tomorrow is
your birthday...

789
00:53:33,042 --> 00:53:35,794
and your grandma will come
and bring you a nice present

790
00:53:35,961 --> 00:53:37,796
A new tank?

791
00:53:38,255 --> 00:53:40,466
No, a surprise

792
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:43,135
Give the letter to your mom

793
00:53:44,261 --> 00:53:45,429
Bye, Joshua

794
00:53:45,721 --> 00:53:48,182
You forgot your change, Grandma

795
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,731
Thank you

796
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:58,651
- When are you coming?
- In an hour or so

797
00:53:59,109 --> 00:54:01,829
I'm going to stop by my uncle's to
see if he'll bring some leftovers

798
00:54:02,905 --> 00:54:05,574
- Then what did Grandma say?
- She's coming tomorrow

799
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:09,620
It's about time!

800
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:14,625
JEWISH STORE

801
00:54:15,125 --> 00:54:17,670
- Go take a bath.
- I took one on Friday!

802
00:54:17,878 --> 00:54:19,505
He's right

803
00:54:19,964 --> 00:54:21,465
You change your shirt

804
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:24,343
- I changed it on Thursday!
- Don't forget the flowers!

805
00:54:24,677 --> 00:54:26,512
They're outside, I
already picked them

806
00:54:26,804 --> 00:54:30,474
- I'll come with you, Pop!
- You have to take a bath, stubborn!

807
00:54:30,975 --> 00:54:32,309
I don't want to take one!

808
00:54:33,894 --> 00:54:35,646
Hurry up, I have to
go pick Grandma up!

809
00:54:43,529 --> 00:54:46,369
- Where do you want the flowers?
- Set them down, I'll be right there

810
00:54:56,417 --> 00:54:58,377
I took one on Friday!

811
00:55:04,133 --> 00:55:05,968
Do you know where Joshua is?

812
00:55:06,218 --> 00:55:08,053
He must be in there

813
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:10,097
Could you put those
things in order?

814
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:12,474
Why don't you show me the
flowers? They look so beautiful

815
00:55:12,683 --> 00:55:15,323
They are, I'll bring them right
over. You want to see the flowers?

816
00:55:15,477 --> 00:55:19,148
I'll make them come right over

817
00:55:19,565 --> 00:55:21,233
Come, flowers!

818
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,651
Come, stand!

819
00:55:22,818 --> 00:55:24,978
Schopenhauer, willpower. I
want the stand to come here

820
00:55:25,029 --> 00:55:26,530
Stand, come

821
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,284
Stop, stand!

822
00:55:30,784 --> 00:55:33,537
This stand seems
very dirty to me

823
00:55:34,538 --> 00:55:36,665
Good morning, princess!

824
00:55:41,754 --> 00:55:43,756
He can already read and write?

825
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:46,717
- For over a year now.
- You did a good job

826
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:48,594
We're here

827
00:55:48,886 --> 00:55:50,512
I'll help you get out

828
00:55:50,846 --> 00:55:52,556
No, I can do it myself

829
00:56:10,115 --> 00:56:11,951
Dora, what's wrong?

830
00:56:32,721 --> 00:56:34,348
Are we there?

831
00:56:35,057 --> 00:56:36,600
No, it's a crossing

832
00:56:36,934 --> 00:56:39,478
Will you tell me where
we're going now?

833
00:56:40,062 --> 00:56:41,647
What do you mean, where?

834
00:56:42,398 --> 00:56:44,692
You asked me a thousand
times! We're going...

835
00:56:45,484 --> 00:56:47,862
to the place...
What's it called?

836
00:56:48,612 --> 00:56:49,612
We're going...

837
00:56:49,905 --> 00:56:50,905
Where are we going?

838
00:56:51,198 --> 00:56:55,035
What day is it today?
Today is your birthday!

839
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:58,956
You've always said you
wanted to go on a trip!

840
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:02,442
It took me months to
plan this whole thing!

841
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:05,587
You know where we're going?

842
00:57:06,782 --> 00:57:08,907
I can't tell you. I promised
Mom I wouldn't tell

843
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:11,078
You know how she
is. She'll get mad

844
00:57:11,211 --> 00:57:13,292
It makes me laugh

845
00:57:13,382 --> 00:57:16,481
My pop planned something like
this for me when I was little too

846
00:57:16,703 --> 00:57:20,157
It was so... Boy, was it funny!

847
00:57:23,126 --> 00:57:25,561
I'm not going to tell you

848
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:31,229
I want you to see for yourself

849
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:33,400
It's a surprise, you
know, it really...

850
00:57:33,755 --> 00:57:36,811
It really makes me laugh

851
00:57:37,077 --> 00:57:38,544
I'm tired

852
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:42,162
Go to sleep

853
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:49,049
Where are we going? Where
are they taking us?

854
00:58:09,528 --> 00:58:12,948
What time is it? We're
leaving right on time

855
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:15,283
What organization!

856
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,911
- You've never taken a train, huh?
- No. Is it nice?

857
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:19,204
It's really nice!

858
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:22,582
It's all wooden inside, everybody
stands up, there's not one seat

859
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:26,253
- There aren't any seats?
- What? Seats on a train?

860
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:28,672
It's obvious you've
never been on one!

861
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:31,841
No, everybody stands
real close together

862
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:35,887
Do you see this line? I got the
last tickets just in time!

863
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:39,243
Hurry up, Uncle Eliseo, I don't
want them to say, "Too late..."

864
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,560
it's full, go back home."

865
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:44,396
Wait up, we've got a reservation!
Leave some room for us!

866
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:47,482
Look at the line!

867
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:51,194
Here we are! We
made a reservation!

868
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:55,782
Thank you!

869
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:00,495
May I help you?

870
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:04,124
There's been a mistake

871
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,209
What mistake?

872
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:08,712
My husband and son
are on that train

873
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:12,507
What's your husband's name?

874
00:59:12,841 --> 00:59:14,509
Guido Orefice

875
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:22,601
Joshua Orefice...

876
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,686
and Eliseo Orefice...

877
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:26,104
are on the train too

878
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,732
There's no mistake

879
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:32,402
I want to get on that train too

880
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:36,489
We're all ready

881
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:38,241
Send them off then

882
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:39,659
Go! Leave!

883
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:44,372
Go back home, ma'am

884
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,167
I want to get on that train

885
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:58,386
Let me get on that train!

886
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:30,626
Mom's here!

887
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:35,882
They stopped the train
to let Mom get on

888
01:02:40,466 --> 01:02:41,884
Uncle Eliseo

889
01:03:21,674 --> 01:03:24,927
Are you happy? Did you see
this place? Are you tired?

890
01:03:25,845 --> 01:03:29,015
- I didn't like the
train - Me neither

891
01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:31,183
We'll take the bus back

892
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:34,770
We're taking the bus back! The
one with the seats in it!

893
01:03:34,979 --> 01:03:36,814
- I told them - That's better

894
01:03:36,981 --> 01:03:39,525
You see? It's all organized!

895
01:03:39,984 --> 01:03:43,404
Did you see that line! People
are lined up to get inside!

896
01:03:43,863 --> 01:03:47,116
Everybody wants to get in!

897
01:03:47,533 --> 01:03:49,577
What game is this?

898
01:03:50,119 --> 01:03:51,119
That's it!

899
01:03:51,495 --> 01:03:52,955
It's that game where...

900
01:03:53,497 --> 01:03:55,625
It's the game...

901
01:03:55,917 --> 01:04:00,129
We're all players

902
01:04:01,756 --> 01:04:04,300
It's all organized. The game is:

903
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:07,386
The men are over here,
the women are over there

904
01:04:07,553 --> 01:04:10,348
Then there's the soldiers,
they give us our schedule

905
01:04:10,681 --> 01:04:12,725
It's hard. You know,
it's not easy

906
01:04:13,476 --> 01:04:16,979
If somebody makes a mistake,
they get sent right home

907
01:04:17,313 --> 01:04:19,023
That means you
have to be careful

908
01:04:19,482 --> 01:04:22,902
But if you win, you
get first prize!

909
01:04:23,027 --> 01:04:25,237
What's the prize?

910
01:04:25,238 --> 01:04:27,156
First prize!

911
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:31,619
- It's a tank - I
already have one

912
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:34,330
This one's a real tank!

913
01:04:34,497 --> 01:04:35,665
Brand new!

914
01:04:35,831 --> 01:04:37,625
Real?

915
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:40,670
Yes! I didn't want to tell you

916
01:04:48,177 --> 01:04:49,929
Where's Uncle Eliseo going?

917
01:04:50,304 --> 01:04:52,848
He's on another team.
It's all organized

918
01:04:53,099 --> 01:04:55,017
Bye, Uncle Eliseo!

919
01:04:57,812 --> 01:04:59,939
A real tank

920
01:05:14,412 --> 01:05:16,289
What did I tell you?

921
01:05:17,331 --> 01:05:18,583
Fabulous!

922
01:05:19,041 --> 01:05:20,126
What a place!

923
01:05:20,418 --> 01:05:23,588
Hurry up or they'll steal our
places. We've got a reservation

924
01:05:24,046 --> 01:05:25,131
Two singles!

925
01:05:25,756 --> 01:05:28,217
Coming through!

926
01:05:28,676 --> 01:05:30,511
There's our place!

927
01:05:35,933 --> 01:05:37,894
This is our bed. We'll
sleep real close

928
01:05:40,187 --> 01:05:43,941
It's ugly here, it smells.
I want to be with Mommy

929
01:05:44,609 --> 01:05:46,110
We will be!

930
01:05:46,235 --> 01:05:47,235
I'm hungry!

931
01:05:47,403 --> 01:05:48,487
We'll eat!

932
01:05:49,113 --> 01:05:51,782
Plus they're really
mean here. They yell!

933
01:05:52,325 --> 01:05:56,370
They yell because everybody wants
first prize. They have to be tough

934
01:05:56,954 --> 01:05:59,248
Can I see Mommy?

935
01:05:59,832 --> 01:06:01,292
When the game's over

936
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:02,752
When's it over?

937
01:06:04,754 --> 01:06:07,506
You have to get 1000 points

938
01:06:08,674 --> 01:06:10,968
Whoever gets 1000
points wins a tank

939
01:06:11,302 --> 01:06:14,055
I don't believe you. Are
we getting a snack?

940
01:06:14,347 --> 01:06:16,224
A snack?

941
01:06:17,266 --> 01:06:19,310
Just ask. We're all friends here

942
01:06:19,518 --> 01:06:22,271
- Look who's here! What's his name...
- Bartolomeo

943
01:06:22,772 --> 01:06:24,482
Let me ask you something

944
01:06:24,732 --> 01:06:28,319
Did the guy who hands out the
bread and jam already come by?

945
01:06:29,445 --> 01:06:32,532
Darn it all! We missed
him by a second!

946
01:06:33,115 --> 01:06:36,202
He'll come back again
though, won't he?

947
01:06:36,744 --> 01:06:38,204
He's coming back

948
01:06:45,628 --> 01:06:46,712
What did he say?

949
01:06:46,796 --> 01:06:48,714
He asked if anyone speaks German

950
01:06:48,923 --> 01:06:50,967
He's going to explain
the camp's rules

951
01:06:54,428 --> 01:06:56,472
- Do you speak German?
- No

952
01:07:06,315 --> 01:07:09,569
The game starts now. Whoever's
here is here, whoever's not is not

953
01:07:13,197 --> 01:07:16,784
The first one to get a thousand
points wins. The prize is a tank!

954
01:07:18,244 --> 01:07:19,495
Lucky him!

955
01:07:27,963 --> 01:07:31,049
Every day we'll announce who's in
the lead from that loudspeaker

956
01:07:31,425 --> 01:07:34,145
The one with the least points has
to wear a sign saying "jackass"...

957
01:07:34,469 --> 01:07:36,221
right here on his back

958
01:07:43,353 --> 01:07:46,315
We play the part of the
real mean guys who yell

959
01:07:46,523 --> 01:07:48,817
Whoever's scared loses points

960
01:08:03,165 --> 01:08:05,834
In three cases you'll
lose all your points

961
01:08:05,918 --> 01:08:09,254
One: If you start crying

962
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:12,299
Two: If you want
to see your mommy

963
01:08:12,466 --> 01:08:15,802
Three: If you're hungry
and you want a snack

964
01:08:16,178 --> 01:08:17,596
Forget about it!

965
01:08:26,521 --> 01:08:28,899
It's easy to lose
points for being hungry

966
01:08:29,191 --> 01:08:31,151
Just yesterday I
lost 40 points...

967
01:08:31,276 --> 01:08:33,570
because I absolutely had
to have a jam sandwich

968
01:08:35,697 --> 01:08:36,782
Apricot jam!

969
01:08:38,534 --> 01:08:40,202
He wanted strawberry

970
01:08:46,708 --> 01:08:49,545
Don't ask for any lollipops.
You won't get any

971
01:08:49,711 --> 01:08:51,338
We eat them all!

972
01:08:53,257 --> 01:08:55,092
I ate twenty of them yesterday!

973
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:58,053
What a stomach ache!

974
01:08:58,554 --> 01:08:59,805
But they sure were good

975
01:09:00,764 --> 01:09:01,932
You bet!

976
01:09:10,649 --> 01:09:13,110
Sorry if I'm going so fast,
but I'm playing hide-and-seek

977
01:09:13,443 --> 01:09:15,362
I have to go now,
or they'll find me

978
01:09:25,289 --> 01:09:29,042
Don't ask me anything Ask
Bartolomeo, he knows everything

979
01:09:29,209 --> 01:09:31,503
Don't forget to tell
me what he said too

980
01:09:32,087 --> 01:09:34,047
A thousand points?

981
01:09:34,214 --> 01:09:36,258
I told you we're
going to have fun!

982
01:09:36,925 --> 01:09:38,719
These guys are crazy!

983
01:09:38,886 --> 01:09:42,472
This has to weigh a hundred kilos!
It's got to be 3,000 degrees in here!

984
01:09:42,723 --> 01:09:45,100
Vittorino, I can't cope anymore!

985
01:09:45,434 --> 01:09:47,834
- After only the first one?
- Why, are there more to move?

986
01:09:48,478 --> 01:09:49,979
We're here until tonight!

987
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:54,109
Bartolomeo, what happened?
Where are they taking you?

988
01:09:54,234 --> 01:09:56,278
To the hospital. I hurt my arm

989
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,115
We're going to die here!

990
01:10:00,574 --> 01:10:04,244
I can't take it anymore!
I'm putting this down

991
01:10:04,453 --> 01:10:08,290
I'll tell them I can't do
it. What can they do to me?

992
01:10:08,624 --> 01:10:09,625
They'll kill you!

993
01:10:10,542 --> 01:10:14,046
- Where does this thing go?
- Down there

994
01:10:14,379 --> 01:10:17,049
Good Lord, I'll never make it!

995
01:10:23,597 --> 01:10:28,310
It's got to be 10,000
degrees in here

996
01:10:57,881 --> 01:10:59,299
Pop!

997
01:11:14,856 --> 01:11:17,859
Look here! See? It's nice, huh?

998
01:11:20,362 --> 01:11:22,030
We're signed up

999
01:11:22,865 --> 01:11:25,242
When I got there to sign up...

1000
01:11:25,534 --> 01:11:27,744
the referee was
there and he said:

1001
01:11:28,161 --> 01:11:29,955
"No, you and your son
aren't on the list...

1002
01:11:30,247 --> 01:11:33,584
you didn't pay your dues."

1003
01:11:34,042 --> 01:11:35,961
I almost fell over

1004
01:11:36,169 --> 01:11:39,590
He said, "You can go home."
I said, "No, you go home!

1005
01:11:40,090 --> 01:11:42,217
Joshua and I signed up

1006
01:11:42,801 --> 01:11:47,514
"Give me my number!" In fact,
they gave me one. Look!

1007
01:11:47,681 --> 01:11:50,934
I had them put it here
too, just in case

1008
01:11:51,518 --> 01:11:53,729
See what a nice place...

1009
01:11:53,854 --> 01:11:56,648
your pop takes you to?

1010
01:11:58,567 --> 01:12:01,111
Did you play with
the other kids?

1011
01:12:01,361 --> 01:12:04,198
Yes, but they don't
know the rules

1012
01:12:04,364 --> 01:12:07,618
They said it isn't true
that first prize is a tank

1013
01:12:07,910 --> 01:12:09,870
They don't know anything
about the points

1014
01:12:10,579 --> 01:12:13,665
Did you fall for that?
They're as sly as foxes

1015
01:12:13,833 --> 01:12:16,044
They want to beat
you! Are you joking?

1016
01:12:16,211 --> 01:12:19,255
There's no tank? Don't
you believe them!

1017
01:12:19,756 --> 01:12:22,050
How many points
did we get today?

1018
01:12:24,677 --> 01:12:27,555
48, they took two points
away from me because...

1019
01:12:27,931 --> 01:12:29,641
I tripped while I was...

1020
01:12:30,099 --> 01:12:31,267
playing hopscotch

1021
01:12:33,353 --> 01:12:37,398
We laughed like crazy
today! I died laughing!

1022
01:12:37,523 --> 01:12:39,901
Boy, did I have fun!

1023
01:12:40,485 --> 01:12:43,029
I can't wait to start all
over again tomorrow!

1024
01:12:43,655 --> 01:12:45,865
Hopscotch, tug of war...

1025
01:12:45,949 --> 01:12:47,408
and ring-around-the-rosy

1026
01:12:47,825 --> 01:12:50,912
Every game. I don't even
remember all of them

1027
01:12:50,995 --> 01:12:53,456
"You guys are obsessed.
Stop, I'm tired!" I said

1028
01:12:54,207 --> 01:12:56,918
Listen, did you eat something?

1029
01:12:57,168 --> 01:12:59,295
Yes, but I didn't
ask for a snack

1030
01:12:59,879 --> 01:13:03,216
Good boy! That means
you got 12 points too!

1031
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:06,803
48 for me, 12 for
you. 60 points!

1032
01:13:07,136 --> 01:13:10,223
This is what you get
when you get up to 60

1033
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:13,893
A plain piece of bread, no jam

1034
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:15,562
Here, eat this

1035
01:13:18,898 --> 01:13:21,901
- Is 60 points a lot?
- Are you kidding?

1036
01:13:22,235 --> 01:13:23,903
It sure is!

1037
01:13:27,657 --> 01:13:30,201
Look who's here! Bartolomeo!

1038
01:13:30,577 --> 01:13:32,453
How'd it go?

1039
01:13:32,704 --> 01:13:34,747
Any worse than this...
I got 20 of them

1040
01:13:39,377 --> 01:13:42,129
We got more than him

1041
01:13:42,130 --> 01:13:45,300
Don't tell him that.
We're in the lead!

1042
01:13:54,183 --> 01:13:56,853
I already told you, no
children or old ladies!

1043
01:13:57,145 --> 01:13:59,272
Back inside! You don't work!

1044
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:01,524
The rest, downstairs!

1045
01:14:03,109 --> 01:14:05,862
Let's go, girls, quickly.
Come on. This way!

1046
01:14:07,238 --> 01:14:09,699
That one's new, she
learned right away

1047
01:14:10,074 --> 01:14:13,328
The lady at the door, she
seemed nice when she first came

1048
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:15,246
She's the worst of all!

1049
01:14:15,455 --> 01:14:17,855
At least she didn't send the old
ladies and children to work

1050
01:14:18,458 --> 01:14:21,711
They don't send old people and kids
to work because they kill them!

1051
01:14:22,003 --> 01:14:24,714
One of these days they'll
call them to take a shower

1052
01:14:24,964 --> 01:14:26,633
"Children, shower time!"

1053
01:14:26,841 --> 01:14:30,011
The truth is, they make them
shower there, in the gas chamber

1054
01:14:37,310 --> 01:14:38,561
Downstairs!

1055
01:14:43,441 --> 01:14:45,318
How can I do this?

1056
01:14:45,568 --> 01:14:47,320
Vittorino!

1057
01:14:48,613 --> 01:14:51,699
Where'd they find
all these anvils?

1058
01:14:51,866 --> 01:14:53,117
Pop!

1059
01:14:55,578 --> 01:14:57,872
Why are you here? You're
not supposed to be here!

1060
01:14:58,498 --> 01:14:59,666
Go away!

1061
01:14:59,999 --> 01:15:01,584
Why aren't you with
the other kids?

1062
01:15:02,377 --> 01:15:03,378
They said...

1063
01:15:03,545 --> 01:15:07,590
all us kids have to take a
shower today and I don't want to

1064
01:15:08,424 --> 01:15:09,968
Go take a shower!

1065
01:15:10,176 --> 01:15:11,176
No!

1066
01:15:12,178 --> 01:15:13,721
I'm not going to

1067
01:15:14,138 --> 01:15:15,390
Go take a shower!

1068
01:15:16,641 --> 01:15:18,476
What are you doing here?

1069
01:15:20,228 --> 01:15:22,105
We're making...

1070
01:15:22,647 --> 01:15:24,857
the tank

1071
01:15:25,358 --> 01:15:28,403
We're building the tank. We're
still working on the tracks

1072
01:15:28,486 --> 01:15:30,530
We're running slow

1073
01:15:32,323 --> 01:15:34,993
You can't stay here.
Go take your shower!

1074
01:15:35,493 --> 01:15:37,787
I don't want to!

1075
01:15:38,621 --> 01:15:42,041
You stubborn thing! I'll tell
Mom! Ten points off for you!

1076
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:45,587
Hide behind there. We'll go
back together when I'm done

1077
01:15:46,004 --> 01:15:47,589
Don't let anyone see you!

1078
01:15:47,964 --> 01:15:49,465
This sure is fun!

1079
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:04,730
Everything!

1080
01:16:04,856 --> 01:16:06,983
Take everything off!
Hang it up there!

1081
01:16:07,942 --> 01:16:09,986
You'll get it back
after the shower

1082
01:16:11,070 --> 01:16:12,238
Forward!

1083
01:16:14,365 --> 01:16:17,452
Remember your number to
get your clothes back!

1084
01:16:20,538 --> 01:16:22,749
Women and children
will shower together

1085
01:16:23,249 --> 01:16:24,751
Are you hurt?

1086
01:16:36,387 --> 01:16:37,555
Thanks, Bartolomeo

1087
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:41,351
From now on, you have to
hide here the whole day

1088
01:16:41,517 --> 01:16:43,728
If they see us now, it's
over, we're disqualified!

1089
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:45,520
What do I have to do?

1090
01:16:46,022 --> 01:16:48,066
You have to stay.
Vittorino, help me out

1091
01:16:48,399 --> 01:16:50,526
You have to hide here all day

1092
01:16:50,735 --> 01:16:53,655
Don't let anyone see you,
especially those mean guys who yell

1093
01:16:54,948 --> 01:16:56,199
Remember...

1094
01:16:56,282 --> 01:16:58,201
stay hidden!

1095
01:16:58,493 --> 01:17:00,620
This is the hardest part

1096
01:17:01,329 --> 01:17:05,375
If we get this right, the tank is
ours, it's worth 120 points a day

1097
01:17:06,043 --> 01:17:08,712
I'll take you with me, I'll
hide you. You're gone!

1098
01:17:09,171 --> 01:17:11,715
Who's ever seen you before?
Who are you? Where is he?

1099
01:17:12,049 --> 01:17:13,133
Got it?

1100
01:17:18,722 --> 01:17:19,890
Gotcha!

1101
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:22,850
Good boy!

1102
01:18:39,803 --> 01:18:42,181
Anybody here? Am I disturbing?

1103
01:18:50,564 --> 01:18:52,608
Come here!

1104
01:18:53,067 --> 01:18:54,735
Quick as lightning!

1105
01:19:01,075 --> 01:19:02,326
Good morning, princess!

1106
01:19:03,118 --> 01:19:04,286
Last night...

1107
01:19:04,411 --> 01:19:06,872
I dreamt about you all night!

1108
01:19:07,289 --> 01:19:10,876
We were going to the movies, you
were wearing that pink suit...

1109
01:19:11,126 --> 01:19:12,378
that I really like

1110
01:19:12,962 --> 01:19:15,005
You're all I think
about, princess

1111
01:19:15,422 --> 01:19:17,967
I always think about
you. And now...

1112
01:19:18,259 --> 01:19:19,260
Mommy!

1113
01:19:19,635 --> 01:19:23,639
Pop wheels me in the wheelbarrow
but he doesn't know how to drive!

1114
01:19:23,847 --> 01:19:26,058
He kills me laughing!

1115
01:19:26,225 --> 01:19:28,894
We're in the lead! How many
points do we have today?

1116
01:19:29,395 --> 01:19:32,273
Run! The mean guys who
yell are behind us!

1117
01:19:32,481 --> 01:19:35,568
- Where?
- Over here. Over here!

1118
01:19:49,415 --> 01:19:51,000
Are they dry?

1119
01:19:51,917 --> 01:19:54,211
They're dry

1120
01:19:54,461 --> 01:19:55,461
Catch

1121
01:19:56,422 --> 01:19:57,590
Get dressed

1122
01:20:12,104 --> 01:20:15,274
What happened to Vittorino,
Alfonso and the others?

1123
01:20:15,774 --> 01:20:17,401
They didn't make it

1124
01:21:10,454 --> 01:21:12,498
"If you say my name, I'm
not there anymore."

1125
01:21:14,124 --> 01:21:15,124
"Silence."

1126
01:21:49,285 --> 01:21:51,566
Thank goodness, I was getting
scared What happened to you?

1127
01:21:51,621 --> 01:21:53,999
They're half-crazy!

1128
01:21:55,792 --> 01:21:58,545
The man who does the
check-ups, the captain...

1129
01:21:58,670 --> 01:22:01,047
he's a friend of mine. I met
him when I was a waiter

1130
01:22:01,214 --> 01:22:05,218
He said they're having a dinner with
all the officials and their wives

1131
01:22:05,468 --> 01:22:08,388
He asked me if I wanted to
wait tables at the dinner

1132
01:22:09,431 --> 01:22:12,434
Maybe he wants to help me.
He might get us out of here

1133
01:22:19,274 --> 01:22:21,318
Have you seen Joshua?

1134
01:22:21,735 --> 01:22:22,986
What do you mean, "no"?

1135
01:22:30,744 --> 01:22:32,871
What are you doing? Come here!

1136
01:22:33,121 --> 01:22:34,122
No

1137
01:22:34,789 --> 01:22:36,750
I told you to come

1138
01:22:37,459 --> 01:22:39,044
No? Come on out!

1139
01:22:40,170 --> 01:22:43,048
Come out! Look here,
you're all dirty

1140
01:22:43,673 --> 01:22:44,925
Where have you been?

1141
01:22:46,301 --> 01:22:49,179
I had to finish playing rummy

1142
01:22:49,804 --> 01:22:52,265
They make buttons
and soap out of us

1143
01:22:55,227 --> 01:22:56,478
What are you saying?

1144
01:22:56,603 --> 01:22:58,605
They burn us all in the oven

1145
01:22:59,773 --> 01:23:00,773
Who told you that?

1146
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:04,027
A man was crying.

1147
01:23:04,527 --> 01:23:07,197
He said they make buttons
and soap out of us

1148
01:23:09,282 --> 01:23:11,493
You fell for that?

1149
01:23:11,868 --> 01:23:13,119
Again?

1150
01:23:14,287 --> 01:23:17,249
I thought you were a sharp
boy, cunning, intelligent

1151
01:23:17,582 --> 01:23:20,835
Buttons and soap out of
people? That'll be the day!

1152
01:23:21,795 --> 01:23:23,463
You believed that?

1153
01:23:24,214 --> 01:23:29,010
Just imagine, tomorrow morning
I'll wash my hands with Bartolomeo

1154
01:23:29,261 --> 01:23:30,637
A good scrub...

1155
01:23:30,887 --> 01:23:32,389
then I'll button
up with Francesco

1156
01:23:32,764 --> 01:23:34,182
Darn it all!

1157
01:23:34,975 --> 01:23:36,851
Look! I just lost Giorgio!

1158
01:23:37,269 --> 01:23:38,687
Does this look like a person?

1159
01:23:39,688 --> 01:23:42,857
Come on! They were teasing
you! And you fell for it!

1160
01:23:43,191 --> 01:23:45,318
What else did they tell you?

1161
01:23:45,610 --> 01:23:47,362
That we get cooked in the oven

1162
01:23:51,491 --> 01:23:53,326
They burn us up in the oven

1163
01:23:54,744 --> 01:24:00,333
You fell for that too! You
just eat everything up!

1164
01:24:00,417 --> 01:24:02,544
I've heard of a wood oven...

1165
01:24:02,752 --> 01:24:05,213
but I've never seen
a man oven before

1166
01:24:05,672 --> 01:24:08,758
I'm out of wood!
Take this lawyer!

1167
01:24:09,009 --> 01:24:11,970
This lawyer doesn't burn,
he's not dry enough!

1168
01:24:12,178 --> 01:24:13,889
Look at that smoke!

1169
01:24:15,599 --> 01:24:17,893
Buttons, soap, we get
burned in the oven...

1170
01:24:18,226 --> 01:24:20,228
Let's be serious now

1171
01:24:20,478 --> 01:24:23,273
I have a bag race with
the bad guys tomorrow...

1172
01:24:23,690 --> 01:24:26,067
That's enough. I want to go home

1173
01:24:28,612 --> 01:24:29,779
Now?

1174
01:24:30,030 --> 01:24:31,030
Right now

1175
01:24:31,531 --> 01:24:34,701
It's raining now. You'll come
down with a terrible fever!

1176
01:24:34,951 --> 01:24:36,786
I don't care. Let's go

1177
01:24:37,829 --> 01:24:39,873
All right, if you want to go...

1178
01:24:40,248 --> 01:24:44,002
I'll get our stuff
and we'll leave

1179
01:24:44,794 --> 01:24:45,962
We can leave?

1180
01:24:46,254 --> 01:24:49,591
Naturally! What do you think they
do, force people to stay here?

1181
01:24:50,133 --> 01:24:51,760
That'll be the day!

1182
01:24:52,010 --> 01:24:54,554
Wouldn't that be great! Let's
go, we'll pack our bags...

1183
01:24:54,971 --> 01:24:56,556
and get out of here

1184
01:24:56,848 --> 01:25:00,185
What a shame, we were in the lead.
We're quitting, off the list we go

1185
01:25:00,727 --> 01:25:04,940
Some other kid will
win that real tank

1186
01:25:05,190 --> 01:25:07,317
There aren't any other kids,
I'm the only one left

1187
01:25:07,776 --> 01:25:11,112
There aren't any more kids?
It's full of them here!

1188
01:25:11,279 --> 01:25:12,697
Where are they then?

1189
01:25:13,156 --> 01:25:15,825
They're all hiding. Nobody's
supposed to see them

1190
01:25:16,159 --> 01:25:19,579
- This is a serious game!
- I just don't get it

1191
01:25:19,788 --> 01:25:21,623
How many points do we have?

1192
01:25:21,748 --> 01:25:23,959
Almost 687...

1193
01:25:24,209 --> 01:25:26,253
I told you a thousand times

1194
01:25:26,962 --> 01:25:28,296
Let's go, though

1195
01:25:28,505 --> 01:25:31,174
- We're winning. But if you want...
- We're winning?

1196
01:25:31,508 --> 01:25:33,635
We're in first. I told you

1197
01:25:34,135 --> 01:25:36,263
But we'll quit if you want

1198
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:39,349
I saw the chart yesterday.
We'll go anyway, though

1199
01:25:40,016 --> 01:25:41,935
Bye, Bartolomeo. Joshua
and I are leaving

1200
01:25:42,185 --> 01:25:43,770
We're fed up here

1201
01:25:43,853 --> 01:25:47,691
The tank is done, it's ready

1202
01:25:48,149 --> 01:25:51,111
Clean the spark plugs
off before you start it

1203
01:25:51,361 --> 01:25:53,905
Open the throttle

1204
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:57,659
Otherwise the cannon will
get stuck with the tracks

1205
01:25:57,909 --> 01:26:00,120
And the gun, did you see how nice
it is? It came out beautiful!

1206
01:26:00,370 --> 01:26:02,914
Lift the emergency brake
off before you move!

1207
01:26:03,415 --> 01:26:06,167
Me and him are going

1208
01:26:06,376 --> 01:26:07,961
Joshua wants to quit

1209
01:26:08,086 --> 01:26:10,886
We could have gone back with a tank
soon, but we'll take the bus today

1210
01:26:11,047 --> 01:26:13,800
Me and Joshua are leaving.
So long, everybody!

1211
01:26:14,009 --> 01:26:15,760
We're tired of this place

1212
01:26:16,344 --> 01:26:19,014
Let's go or we'll miss the bus

1213
01:26:24,019 --> 01:26:25,270
Let's go, Joshua

1214
01:26:29,065 --> 01:26:31,860
It's raining, I'll come
down with a terrible fever!

1215
01:27:41,264 --> 01:27:45,184
It's me, Pop!

1216
01:27:45,977 --> 01:27:48,729
I have to tell you something
important Come here!

1217
01:27:48,938 --> 01:27:51,399
That little rascal's been running
away from me all morning

1218
01:27:51,524 --> 01:27:54,193
- Is there really a kid?
- There must be 2000!

1219
01:27:54,485 --> 01:27:56,445
They're like mice, they
hide all over the place!

1220
01:27:56,696 --> 01:27:58,906
Those creeps want
our tank! Stop!

1221
01:27:59,699 --> 01:28:00,783
Wait

1222
01:28:02,869 --> 01:28:04,412
I might have spotted him

1223
01:28:04,662 --> 01:28:06,581
I think he's nearby

1224
01:28:06,831 --> 01:28:11,294
Look. Go see if he's hiding
in there. I'll wait here

1225
01:28:11,544 --> 01:28:13,170
I'll keep a watch out

1226
01:28:20,136 --> 01:28:21,220
He's there, Pop!

1227
01:28:21,470 --> 01:28:23,306
What'd he look like? Brown hair?

1228
01:28:24,265 --> 01:28:26,475
That's him, then.
His name is Schwanz

1229
01:28:26,767 --> 01:28:28,728
He's been in there
for three weeks

1230
01:28:29,186 --> 01:28:31,230
He was the runner-up,
we beat him though!

1231
01:28:31,814 --> 01:28:34,733
Sooner or later I'll
find the others too

1232
01:28:34,734 --> 01:28:37,111
How many are there? It's
swarming, I told you

1233
01:28:37,445 --> 01:28:39,071
They're all hiding

1234
01:28:48,623 --> 01:28:50,124
Look, Pop!

1235
01:28:50,291 --> 01:28:51,751
There's a hideout!

1236
01:28:53,127 --> 01:28:55,796
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha!
You're out! Let's go

1237
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:04,722
Holy smokes, she saw us!

1238
01:29:04,889 --> 01:29:06,349
Are we out?

1239
01:29:06,933 --> 01:29:08,893
She's coming over for you

1240
01:29:09,018 --> 01:29:11,145
Now it's time for
the be quiet game

1241
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,397
You're never to speak

1242
01:29:13,981 --> 01:29:15,066
Swear it!

1243
01:29:16,776 --> 01:29:18,486
- Swear it!
- I swear

1244
01:29:21,864 --> 01:29:24,325
They all talk strange, you
can't understand a word

1245
01:29:24,659 --> 01:29:27,036
If we get through this,
first prize is ours

1246
01:29:27,495 --> 01:29:30,248
They're rounding up everyone in
first place. It's the silence game

1247
01:29:30,623 --> 01:29:32,542
Not a word, got it?

1248
01:29:39,507 --> 01:29:41,175
Why are you here
with the children?

1249
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:43,761
Quiet! You're never to speak

1250
01:29:45,096 --> 01:29:46,264
I swear

1251
01:30:42,236 --> 01:30:45,072
I have to talk to
you. Very important

1252
01:30:45,197 --> 01:30:48,034
- Where? When?
- I'll signal you. Later

1253
01:31:01,631 --> 01:31:02,632
Thank you

1254
01:31:48,929 --> 01:31:51,807
I told you not to
talk to the children

1255
01:32:19,751 --> 01:32:22,838
Doctor, my wife is here too

1256
01:32:45,027 --> 01:32:46,778
Slowly

1257
01:32:47,070 --> 01:32:48,822
Eat slowly, it's bad for you

1258
01:32:49,031 --> 01:32:52,284
We're in the lead. We
just might leave early

1259
01:32:52,451 --> 01:32:54,203
The game finishes early

1260
01:32:55,662 --> 01:32:58,415
Don't make a mistake now
that we're in the lead

1261
01:32:58,749 --> 01:32:59,833
Slowly

1262
01:33:22,522 --> 01:33:24,358
Pay attention

1263
01:33:29,988 --> 01:33:32,699
Fat, fat, ugly, ugly...

1264
01:33:32,866 --> 01:33:33,951
all yellow in reality

1265
01:33:35,786 --> 01:33:37,913
If you ask me what I am...

1266
01:33:38,163 --> 01:33:40,207
I answer, "cheep, cheep, cheep"

1267
01:33:46,463 --> 01:33:49,216
Walking along, I go poo-poo

1268
01:33:49,841 --> 01:33:52,302
Who am I? Tell me true

1269
01:33:56,890 --> 01:33:58,934
A duckling, right?

1270
01:34:02,062 --> 01:34:03,939
Is it a duckling?

1271
01:34:05,357 --> 01:34:07,651
It's not!

1272
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:11,697
A veterinarian friend of mine
sent it to me from Vienna

1273
01:34:12,531 --> 01:34:14,575
I can't send him mine...

1274
01:34:14,992 --> 01:34:17,744
until I solve this one

1275
01:34:18,996 --> 01:34:20,330
I thought...

1276
01:34:20,747 --> 01:34:22,749
duck-billed platypus...

1277
01:34:23,166 --> 01:34:24,793
but it doesn't go
"cheep, cheep, cheep"

1278
01:34:25,043 --> 01:34:27,087
A duck-billed platypus goes:

1279
01:34:33,427 --> 01:34:36,388
I translated it into
Italian for you last night

1280
01:34:38,932 --> 01:34:41,310
Well, what do you say?

1281
01:34:43,103 --> 01:34:45,063
Everything points to a duckling

1282
01:34:47,816 --> 01:34:49,234
Help me

1283
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:55,240
For heaven's sake...

1284
01:34:55,616 --> 01:34:56,783
help me

1285
01:34:57,993 --> 01:35:00,287
I can't even sleep

1286
01:35:16,220 --> 01:35:18,513
It's the duckling!

1287
01:37:44,619 --> 01:37:47,789
Come here!

1288
01:37:48,831 --> 01:37:52,335
- I'm tired - Come here

1289
01:37:57,382 --> 01:37:58,925
Where are we here?

1290
01:37:59,551 --> 01:38:01,928
I might have taken the wrong way

1291
01:38:02,637 --> 01:38:05,014
Good boy, sleep.
Dream sweet dreams

1292
01:38:05,932 --> 01:38:07,517
Maybe it is only a dream!

1293
01:38:08,226 --> 01:38:09,769
We're dreaming, Joshua

1294
01:38:10,353 --> 01:38:12,730
Tomorrow morning Mommy
will come wake us up...

1295
01:38:13,314 --> 01:38:16,484
and bring us two nice
cups of milk, and cookies

1296
01:38:17,610 --> 01:38:19,070
First we'll eat...

1297
01:38:19,571 --> 01:38:22,323
then I'll make love to
her two or three times

1298
01:38:23,074 --> 01:38:25,201
If I can

1299
01:39:13,875 --> 01:39:15,752
Excuse me, Bartolomeo...

1300
01:39:16,711 --> 01:39:20,381
They've called those two officials
20 times. I bet they escaped

1301
01:39:20,757 --> 01:39:22,077
Did you understand
anything else?

1302
01:39:22,217 --> 01:39:23,801
You don't need to speak German!

1303
01:39:24,302 --> 01:39:26,846
The war is over. They've
running all over the place

1304
01:39:27,388 --> 01:39:29,140
Where are those trucks going?

1305
01:39:29,515 --> 01:39:31,976
The important thing is not
to get on those trucks

1306
01:39:32,518 --> 01:39:34,062
They leave full and
come back empty

1307
01:39:34,437 --> 01:39:35,855
You know where they're going?

1308
01:39:37,357 --> 01:39:40,193
What about the women?
What's going on?

1309
01:39:40,526 --> 01:39:42,987
Let's get out of this
dump and split up

1310
01:39:43,655 --> 01:39:45,095
We don't even have
to pack our bags!

1311
01:39:45,573 --> 01:39:48,034
I've been hearing machine guns
and dogs barking for hours

1312
01:39:48,451 --> 01:39:50,286
They want to get
rid of everything

1313
01:39:50,537 --> 01:39:51,704
I'm leaving

1314
01:39:52,205 --> 01:39:54,499
I'll see you in Viareggio.
We'll start an anvil factory!

1315
01:39:54,832 --> 01:39:56,459
So long, guys, I'm leaving

1316
01:40:13,893 --> 01:40:15,853
Come see

1317
01:40:16,354 --> 01:40:18,731
Look how mad they are! Furious!

1318
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:22,277
You see? They're looking for you

1319
01:40:22,777 --> 01:40:24,779
Just for you. All
this is for you!

1320
01:40:25,113 --> 01:40:27,240
You're the last one,
the last one to find!

1321
01:40:27,657 --> 01:40:29,534
They're even looking
under the rocks!

1322
01:40:29,742 --> 01:40:32,745
The game finishes tomorrow morning.
They're handing out the award

1323
01:40:33,204 --> 01:40:36,374
If they don't find you
tonight, it's worth 60 points!

1324
01:40:36,666 --> 01:40:38,084
How many points do we have?

1325
01:40:38,835 --> 01:40:41,504
We've got 940 points. Plus 60?

1326
01:40:41,754 --> 01:40:43,274
- A thousand!
- First place! We win!

1327
01:40:43,631 --> 01:40:46,551
They're looking all over for
you! Boy, are they mad!

1328
01:40:47,010 --> 01:40:49,554
No mistakes tonight. This is it!

1329
01:40:50,054 --> 01:40:52,265
- Go hide in that box, quick!
- Schwanz is in there

1330
01:40:52,599 --> 01:40:53,766
Who?

1331
01:40:54,809 --> 01:40:57,478
The brown-haired boy

1332
01:40:58,187 --> 01:41:01,441
They got him yesterday.
He was eliminated

1333
01:41:01,774 --> 01:41:04,444
It's the safest place to hide.
Nobody will look there again

1334
01:41:04,652 --> 01:41:07,614
Let's go, quick as
lightning. Come on!

1335
01:41:08,324 --> 01:41:09,909
Inside!

1336
01:41:11,493 --> 01:41:14,663
Take this blanket in
case you get cold

1337
01:41:15,664 --> 01:41:18,125
I'll be back soon

1338
01:41:18,417 --> 01:41:21,837
I'll put them on the wrong track.
I think I saw him over there!

1339
01:41:51,450 --> 01:41:53,327
Pop, you scared the
death out of me!

1340
01:41:53,577 --> 01:41:56,455
Give me the blanket.
Are you cold?

1341
01:41:57,206 --> 01:41:58,582
Give me your sweater then

1342
01:41:59,083 --> 01:42:01,627
I'll throw it on a tree
and put them off track

1343
01:42:02,044 --> 01:42:03,379
They're looking
all over for you!

1344
01:42:03,671 --> 01:42:07,591
Everybody's yelling,
"Where's Joshua?"

1345
01:42:07,758 --> 01:42:10,302
They're even cursing.
They're really, really mad!

1346
01:42:10,761 --> 01:42:14,598
No one will find you. Bye,
now, I'll be back later

1347
01:42:16,225 --> 01:42:17,225
Listen...

1348
01:42:17,643 --> 01:42:20,187
if I'm really late
coming back...

1349
01:42:20,521 --> 01:42:22,314
don't you move

1350
01:42:22,773 --> 01:42:25,317
Don't come out. You're
not to come out...

1351
01:42:25,651 --> 01:42:26,986
until it's completely quiet...

1352
01:42:29,321 --> 01:42:32,116
and nobody is in
sight, just to be safe

1353
01:42:32,366 --> 01:42:33,366
Say it!

1354
01:42:33,701 --> 01:42:36,662
I won't come out until
nobody is around

1355
01:42:37,371 --> 01:42:38,914
Good boy, stubborn

1356
01:43:08,235 --> 01:43:09,235
Leave!

1357
01:43:09,945 --> 01:43:11,822
Go away, dog!

1358
01:43:12,531 --> 01:43:13,531
Go, dog!

1359
01:43:14,241 --> 01:43:21,749
Leave

1360
01:43:28,505 --> 01:43:29,590
Good job, Ferruccio

1361
01:43:30,507 --> 01:43:31,507
It works!

1362
01:43:55,699 --> 01:43:58,786
Is there anyone
called Dora here?

1363
01:44:38,242 --> 01:44:41,120
Dora, are you here? It's Guido

1364
01:44:42,246 --> 01:44:44,957
I know someone is hiding
here. Is there a Dora here?

1365
01:44:54,925 --> 01:44:57,970
Is there a Dora here? She's
Italian. She's my wife

1366
01:44:58,971 --> 01:45:00,639
Yes, there's a Dora here

1367
01:45:01,682 --> 01:45:03,726
It's me, Dora!

1368
01:45:05,436 --> 01:45:07,646
It's not her! Is
there another Dora?

1369
01:45:07,980 --> 01:45:10,140
As soon as you get out of
here, jump out of the truck!

1370
01:45:10,399 --> 01:45:11,984
Get off, jump out!

1371
01:50:30,554 --> 01:50:32,681
It's true!

1372
01:50:42,650 --> 01:50:44,189
Hi, boy

1373
01:50:47,227 --> 01:50:50,056
You all alone? What's your name?

1374
01:50:52,345 --> 01:50:54,145
You don't understand
what I'm saying, do you?

1375
01:50:54,801 --> 01:50:56,001
We'll give you a lift, come on

1376
01:50:56,798 --> 01:50:57,798
Come on, get up here

1377
01:51:04,039 --> 01:51:10,197
Come on. There you go. Ooop!

1378
01:51:52,602 --> 01:51:53,683
Mommy!

1379
01:52:05,335 --> 01:52:06,584
This is my story

1380
01:52:09,664 --> 01:52:11,786
This is the sacrifice
my father made

1381
01:52:14,657 --> 01:52:16,779
This was his gift to me

1382
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:18,735
We won!

1383
01:52:18,819 --> 01:52:19,900
Yes, we won!

1384
01:52:22,106 --> 01:52:25,684
A thousand points to
laugh like crazy about!

1385
01:52:25,977 --> 01:52:29,403
We came in first! We're
taking the tank home!

1386
01:52:29,628 --> 01:52:32,648
We won!
