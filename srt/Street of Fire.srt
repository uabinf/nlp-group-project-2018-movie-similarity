1
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:16,119
It looks like she drug
in a real crowd, don't it?

2
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,704
Sure does.

3
00:01:17,704 --> 00:01:20,039
Looks like it's gonna be
a full house tonight.

4
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:23,084
Hey, what do you say we run in
and check out the show?

5
00:01:29,257 --> 00:01:32,176
How we doing here? We all
set? Hey, big crowd, huh?

6
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:35,054
Yeah, and not one of them's
got a pot to piss in.

7
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:37,223
I never should have let myself
get talked into this dumb benefit.

8
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:41,019
I could be making some real money tonight.
All right, let's get this thing started.

9
00:01:47,734 --> 00:01:50,737
And now back home again

10
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:53,239
the one, the only

11
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,825
Ellen Aim!

12
00:02:16,888 --> 00:02:19,432
Lying in your bed
and on a Saturday night

13
00:02:19,432 --> 00:02:21,934
You're sweatin' buckets
and it's not even hot

14
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:23,853
But your brain
has got the message

15
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:25,271
And it's sending it out

16
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:28,191
To every nerve
and every muscle you've got

17
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:29,567
You've got so many dreams

18
00:02:29,609 --> 00:02:31,778
That you don't know
where to put 'em

19
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,946
So you'd better turn
a few of 'em loose

20
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:36,824
Your body's got a feeling
that it's starting to rust

21
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:39,702
You'd better rev it up
and put it to use

22
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:46,250
And I don't know how I ever thought
that I could make it all alone

23
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:49,671
When you only make it better

24
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:52,465
And it better be tonight

25
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:54,884
I'll be there for you tonight

26
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:57,428
Even if you don't have
anywhere to go

27
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,014
You go down on the pedal
and you're ready to roll

28
00:03:00,056 --> 00:03:01,140
And your speed

29
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:02,266
ls all you'll ever need

30
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:04,769
All you'll ever need to know

31
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:06,479
<i>Damn', Damn'</i>

32
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:09,315
You and me
we're goin' nowhere slowly

33
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:12,068
And we've gotta get away
from the past

34
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,987
There's nothin' wrong
with goin' nowhere, baby

35
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:17,824
But we should
be goin' nowhere fast

36
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:20,702
It's so much better
goin' nowhere fast

37
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,132
Stalkin' in the shadows
by the light of the moon

38
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:36,884
It's like a prison
and the night is a cell

39
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:39,637
Goin' anywhere
has gotta be heaven tonight

40
00:03:39,679 --> 00:03:42,557
'Cause stayin' here
has gotta be hell

41
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:45,935
Dyin' in the city
like a fire on the water

42
00:03:45,977 --> 00:03:48,688
Let's go runnin'
on the back of the wind

43
00:03:48,688 --> 00:03:51,232
There's gotta be some action
on the face of the earth

44
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:54,402
And I've gotta
see your face once again

45
00:03:54,861 --> 00:04:00,867
And I don't know where I ever got
the bright idea that I was cool

46
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:04,287
So alone and independent

47
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:07,123
But I'm depending on you now

48
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:12,462
And you'll always be the only
thing that I just can't be without

49
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:15,465
And I'm out for you tonight

50
00:04:15,882 --> 00:04:18,009
I'm comin' out
for you tonight

51
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,845
Even if you don't
have anywhere to go

52
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:23,306
You go down on the pedal
and you're ready to roll

53
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:24,432
And your speed

54
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:25,641
ls all you'll ever need

55
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:28,227
All you'll ever need to know

56
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:29,729
<i>Damn', Damn'</i>

57
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:32,482
You and me
we're goin' nowhere slowly

58
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,485
And we've gotta get away
from the past

59
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:38,362
There's nothin' wrong
with goin' nowhere, baby

60
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:41,282
But we should be
goin' nowhere fast

61
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:44,118
Everybody's goin'
nowhere slowly

62
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,038
They're only fighting
for the chance to be last

63
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,916
There's nothin' wrong
with goin' nowhere, baby

64
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,418
But we should be
goin' nowhere fast

65
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:08,684
Godspeed

66
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:12,021
Speed us away

67
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:20,279
Godspeed

68
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:22,782
Speed us away

69
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:24,659
We're goin' nowhere fast

70
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,077
Godspeed

71
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,578
We're goin' nowhere fast

72
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,788
Godspeed

73
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,456
We're goin' nowhere fast

74
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:31,874
Godspeed

75
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,335
Speed us away

76
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:36,212
We're goin' nowhere fast

77
00:05:36,254 --> 00:05:37,255
Godspeed

78
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:39,090
We're goin' nowhere fast

79
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:40,174
Godspeed

80
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:41,926
We're goin' nowhere fast

81
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:43,511
Godspeed

82
00:05:43,553 --> 00:05:46,180
Speed us away

83
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:21,924
NOW!

84
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:31,267
Hey, what the hell do you think
you're doing? Get off the stage!

85
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:46,866
Hey, you guys
shouldn't be doing this!

86
00:06:46,908 --> 00:06:48,910
Hey, we don't want
no trouble!

87
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:56,250
Let me go!

88
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:58,169
No!

89
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,795
Let me go!

90
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:02,715
Put me down now!

91
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:07,261
Let me go! Let me go!

92
00:07:12,725 --> 00:07:14,769
Help me!

93
00:07:40,044 --> 00:07:41,963
Get them!

94
00:07:55,351 --> 00:07:58,562
Them Goddamn son-of-a-bitches!
Hang a one-eight.

95
00:08:01,232 --> 00:08:02,942
What's with that guy?

96
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,115
Watch out!

97
00:08:09,115 --> 00:08:11,158
These guys are gonna pay!

98
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:20,084
Someone help me!

99
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,800
Stop it!

100
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,609
Can I help you?
Coffee.

101
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:53,279
Cream and sugar?
Just black.

102
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:35,321
Oh, you guys really know
how to come through a door.

103
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:36,906
What are you trying to prove?

104
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:39,867
We just came down from Kings
Park looking for a good time.

105
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:42,828
You guys already missed all the
excitement. The party's over.

106
00:11:43,162 --> 00:11:49,001
The Roadmasters are hungry. And
when they're hungry, they eat.

107
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,962
The Bombers have brought this
act through The Richmond already.

108
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:54,131
All you're doing in here
is looking like punks.

109
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:55,674
Is that right?

110
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,886
We're just gonna
have to mess the place up.

111
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:08,354
And after we mess your place
up maybe we'll mess you up.

112
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:14,610
Oh, you got a problem
with this, pretty boy?

113
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:34,046
Try it again, punk.

114
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:12,418
Go on, go home!

115
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:21,844
What do you think
of my new car?

116
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:25,597
It looks great. Why don't you
sell it and buy me a new window?

117
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,831
Tom, come on, slow down.

118
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:54,877
Reva, there's no point in stealing a
car, if you're not gonna ring it out.

119
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:08,015
When are you
ever gonna grow up?

120
00:14:08,057 --> 00:14:09,892
Why should I?
This is more fun.

121
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,685
Let me give you
some news, Tom.

122
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:15,230
The Bombers and this guy Raven
Shaddock, they stole Ellen Aim.

123
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:17,149
How the hell did that happen?

124
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,276
Oh, shit!

125
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:21,028
Goddamn cops!

126
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:44,718
Okay, buddy, what the
hell do you think this is?

127
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,595
We don't go for that kind
of speeding around here.

128
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:47,805
Now let's see your license.

129
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:50,349
Sorry, Officer,
I must have left it at home.

130
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:54,978
Tom Cody. It's been a couple of years
since I've had any trouble out of you.

131
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,022
Hey, Ed, I just came home
to visit my big sister.

132
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:59,358
You're not gonna have any
trouble with me. Glad to hear it.

133
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:02,361
We don't need somebody coming back
here trying to give us a hard time.

134
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:05,447
Come on, Ed, he just got back.
Give him a break.

135
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:08,492
Yeah, I'll give him a break.
Get out of here, Cody.

136
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:12,704
Yeah, and anymore driving like
that and I'll give you a ticket.

137
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:13,956
Asshole!

138
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:30,222
Who the hell
does that guy think he is?

139
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:35,227
Well, he's always been a real bad ass.
I busted him a couple of years ago.

140
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:38,397
He had a pistol in the
glove compartment of his car.

141
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:39,690
A real punk, huh?

142
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:43,277
Yeah, he belongs in jail with all
the otherjuvenile delinquents.

143
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:07,593
You sure I'm not gonna be cramping
your style with any guy tonight, huh?

144
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:09,011
No, not tonight.

145
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:11,305
I bring one in now and then
but there's nothing steady.

146
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:12,806
I never seem to find
the right one.

147
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:15,559
Yeah, I ain't having much luck
in that department myself.

148
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:17,895
Look, Tom, you were always
real close with Ellen.

149
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:20,272
She wasn't like all those tramps
you used to run around with.

150
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:22,107
Reva,
it didn't work out, okay?

151
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:24,485
Well, somebody figured out
how to make it work with her.

152
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:26,778
She's been living with a guy
named Billy Fish. Who's that?

153
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,574
He's done some rock joints in The
Battery. He started managing her act.

154
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:33,452
Yeah, she was always
interested in going somewhere.

155
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:34,620
Tom.

156
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,123
She's not just your old girl.

157
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:40,626
Reva, what do you want from
me, huh? You know what I want.

158
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,712
You want me to go rescue an old girlfriend
who's shacked up with another guy?

159
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:45,255
Thanks a lot.

160
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:13,492
Tequila.

161
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:15,994
Hey, Tom! Tom Cody.

162
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:18,830
It's been a long time, pal.
How's your hammer hanging?

163
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,249
How's it going, Clyde?

164
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:23,585
Well, not so hot. I got beat
up trying to save your old girl.

165
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:27,589
I could use a little help with those
guys. You should have been there, Tom.

166
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:31,802
It would have been like the old days when
we were in school. We'd have kicked ass.

167
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:34,221
Hey, bartender, you gonna
shoot the shit all night,

168
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:36,181
or do you wanna
get me another drink?

169
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:37,891
Hey, Tom, would you get a
load of this little heinie?

170
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:39,351
She thinks she owns the place.

171
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:41,895
I'm just trying to
get myself a drink, pal.

172
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:44,773
Well, maybe you've already
had enough, babe.

173
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:47,693
You gotta be kidding me!
Do I look like I'm kidding?

174
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,861
You know, maybe you
ought to pay up <i>as</i> well.

175
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:53,365
You've been driving up a tab here all
night and we're not real big on credit.

176
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,827
Are you trying to say that I can't pay?
Yeah, let's see the color of your money.

177
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:02,207
There. Happy? Yeah. But
now I don't like your face.

178
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:07,337
You know, everywhere I go
there's always an asshole.

179
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:16,930
Hey, you got any preferences?

180
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,100
I've always been
a tequila man.

181
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,399
Let's get out of here.

182
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:31,069
The name's McCoy.
I'm a soldier.

183
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:34,072
At least I was up until about
a year ago, ran out of wars.

184
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,657
Yeah, what's your spec?

185
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:37,117
Motor pool. Nothing fancy.

186
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:39,703
But if it's got wheels I can
drive it and I can fix it.

187
00:18:39,745 --> 00:18:42,247
That's funny, I just got
out a couple of months ago.

188
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:43,665
Been R and R ever since.

189
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:45,626
Yeah?
How'd you like the army?

190
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:49,421
I liked shooting the guns,
but I didn't win no medal.

191
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:52,507
Hey!

192
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:56,762
Is that your car?
Yeah.

193
00:18:57,387 --> 00:19:00,432
Nice. Yeah, I know. I just picked it up.

194
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:05,896
Hey, Cody? That's your
name, right, Cody? Yeah.

195
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:07,731
You got a spare bed?

196
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:11,360
You want a quick tumble, huh?

197
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:15,280
Hey, you may have a rough time
with this one,

198
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,699
and I don't wanna hurt
your feelings, but...

199
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,035
You're not my type.

200
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:23,830
Yeah, I guess it kind of figures. I
ain't had much luck with women lately.

201
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:24,915
Yeah, well, you'll live.

202
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:28,001
Something tells me that getting girls
isn't exactly your problem in life.

203
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:31,922
Maybe some other time, huh? I
doubt it, but anything's possible.

204
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:33,382
Hey, look...

205
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:36,009
About the spare bed.

206
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:39,221
I'm just passing through this
district. I don't know anybody.

207
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:42,432
I'm between jobs and last
time I heard hotels cost money.

208
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:46,561
Get in.

209
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:04,538
My sister's got the bedroom, I got
the spare, that puts you on the couch.

210
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:07,791
Thanks, man, I appreciate it.
Yeah, no sweat.

211
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:21,221
There you go, McCoy.
I'll see you in the morning.

212
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,436
Hey, you always walk around packed,
huh? I told you, I'm a soldier.

213
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:31,273
Yeah, well, don't go pointing that
thing at me, I wouldn't like it.

214
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:33,900
I don't go pointing it,
unless I'm gonna use it.

215
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,402
<i>Yeah, fight.</i>

216
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:16,568
No, you don't get by on pride

217
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:20,447
It'll run over you

218
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,867
But since you let me down

219
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:25,911
I'm hard to be around

220
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:28,580
I don't know
what I'm gonna do

221
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:35,670
He could never be you

222
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:43,303
Okay, you got it.
I'm gonna go and get her.

223
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:46,264
But I ain't doing it
for nothing.

224
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:50,060
You tell this Mr. Billy Fish to meet
me at the diner tomorrow at 12:00.

225
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:52,479
Me and him are gonna talk
some business.

226
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:55,941
Oh, there's a girl I picked up in
the Black-hawk sleeping on the couch.

227
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:58,109
Give her some coffee
in the morning, okay?

228
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,237
How come she's sleeping
in the front room?

229
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:02,280
Why don't you go ask her?

230
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,470
Hey. Pete!

231
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:31,101
Hey, look, I really needed a place to
stay, so thanks for the use of the sofa.

232
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:32,644
Oh, that's okay.

233
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:35,647
You're the first girl Tom
ever brought home that used it.

234
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:38,483
Yeah, well, sometimes it helps a
guy out if you don't make it so easy.

235
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:42,904
He could use a little help in that direction.
Maybe he ought to meet a few more like you.

236
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:48,618
A fellow came through here a
couple of months ago. Tapped out.

237
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,413
Had to part with this outfit
after a card game.

238
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:54,708
Real unhappy about it, too,
'cause it's all custom stuff.

239
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:58,670
I tell you, if Tom wasn't going
for being number two to her music,

240
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:01,131
so he just took off.
He was crazy about Ellen.

241
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:03,216
He was just the kind of guy
who doesn't like to admit it.

242
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:04,676
Yeah, sure, I know the type.

243
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:08,096
I'll tell you something.

244
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:11,892
Some people never talk about their
feelings, they got them deeper than anybody.

245
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:14,686
Other people never talk about their
feelings 'cause they ain't got any.

246
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:22,527
What's your story?
Me? Just looking for work.

247
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:51,139
You must be Billy Fish?

248
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:54,517
Yeah. So what gives, and make
it fast my time is valuable.

249
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,020
You want Ellen Aim back,
I'm gonna get her.

250
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,813
You and what army?

251
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:01,566
I can see you two are gonna
get along just fine.

252
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:06,613
I want 10 grand. Easy. All
you gotta do is earn it.

253
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:09,282
I'll earn it
and you're gonna help.

254
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:12,243
Reva told me you used to
live in The Battery.

255
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:14,746
I started out there.
It's the shits.

256
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:16,831
I wouldn't go back
to that dump if you paid me.

257
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:20,210
You're going! I need somebody
who knows their way around.

258
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:22,087
I don't think so.
It's not my scene.

259
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:24,255
If you want your meal ticket
back, get in the car

260
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:26,341
or otherwise the deal is off.

261
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:29,219
Look, Cody, you sound pretty
dumb, but nobody's that dumb.

262
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,345
I'm the one paying you.

263
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:33,890
That means you go get her, I wait
here and you bring her back to me.

264
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:35,684
You smart guys.

265
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:39,229
You always figure you can hire a
bum like me to do your dirty work.

266
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,064
Well, not this time!

267
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:45,318
Can you really get her back?
You got a better volunteer?

268
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:59,082
All right, I'll go.
She's real important to me.

269
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:15,056
You know The Battery's
gonna be nothing but trouble.

270
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:17,767
Yeah? Well, I'm getting
paid for it, right, Fish?

271
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:20,478
That's right, Cody. You
cut me in, I'll back you up.

272
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:21,521
I don't think so.

273
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:23,982
Hey, what's your problem?
We're not taking no skirt along.

274
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:26,359
Look, I don't think
you can handle it, okay?

275
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:27,610
What do I gotta do?

276
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:30,530
You know, people don't exactly have
written references for this kind of work.

277
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:32,449
You should know that, Cody.

278
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:36,786
I need the job. I'm plenty good
enough and I ain't gonna let you down.

279
00:25:36,828 --> 00:25:40,498
Listen, skirt, let me make it
simple for you. Take a hike.

280
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:47,213
All right. I'll cut you in for 10%,
but get this, you're working for me.

281
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:50,967
I tell you to do something, you do it.
You don't do more or you don't do less.

282
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:53,887
And if you start dragging
your ass, I'm sending you home.

283
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:54,929
Got it.

284
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:56,222
Hey, what is this?
Get serious.

285
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:59,559
I'm not paying you any extra to take
some sweetie pie along for company.

286
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:00,977
You drive.

287
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:06,816
Don't worry about it. They always
hire bums like me for jobs like this.

288
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:32,717
Look, I'll take you through The
Battery where the Bombers hang out,

289
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,052
but I'm not taking any risks.

290
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:35,929
I'm not paying you to add
any thrills to my life.

291
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,723
That's not how it works. You
got a real big mouth, Fish.

292
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:42,102
Look, butch, I buy and sell more
people more valuable than you every day.

293
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:43,895
You know, it's hard to figure
out what's more pathetic,

294
00:26:43,895 --> 00:26:46,272
the way you talk
or the way you dress.

295
00:26:46,314 --> 00:26:47,357
Let me tell you something.

296
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:50,360
These clothes are worth more
than you make in a year.

297
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:53,321
I can see working with you two
is gonna be a real dream.

298
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:14,092
If they got her anywhere,
they got her at Torchies.

299
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:18,138
It's a real knockdown joint, no
class. I used to book bands in there.

300
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:20,765
It's right in the middle of
a big factory. It's the shits.

301
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:24,811
You'll love it, McCoy. lt'sjust your
style. Okay, Cody, what's the plan?

302
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:27,105
How do you figure on handling all
these guys and their motorcycles?

303
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:30,483
You start killing Bombers, we're gonna
be in worse shape than we're already in.

304
00:27:30,525 --> 00:27:32,068
I don't have to kill anybody.

305
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:35,363
The motorcycles don't run so hot
when I'm shooting holes in them.

306
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:06,311
Some neighborhood. Everything's
dead. What a place to come to.

307
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:09,272
Just keep going straight ahead and
then make a left under the bridge.

308
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:10,940
What are you?
Giving me orders now?

309
00:28:10,982 --> 00:28:12,025
Look, I know my way around.

310
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:14,110
That's why you brought me
along, remember?

311
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:15,612
I'll take care
of giving the orders.

312
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:18,531
Get under the bridge,
pull over and kill the lights.

313
00:28:53,274 --> 00:29:00,698
Well one bad stud
moved in my neighborhood

314
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:05,036
He's big and man
I know he ain't no good

315
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:13,461
He don't wear no hat, and
Lord he don't wear no shoes

316
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:17,840
He just hangs on the corner
singing old country blues

317
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:20,927
Oh, well, one bad stud

318
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:27,433
One bad stud

319
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:30,144
I said, one, one, one, one,

320
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:31,521
One bad stud

321
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:39,821
If he likes your baby,
you can kiss your baby goodbye

322
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:44,617
'Cause the girls all love him
like a schoolboy loves his pie

323
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:48,913
He loves his whiskey,
he loves his rock 'n' rye

324
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:52,667
Yes, he loves his whiskey
he loves his rock 'n' rye

325
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:57,880
You know it takes ten bottles
to make that fool get high

326
00:29:58,089 --> 00:30:00,425
Oh, well, one bad stud

327
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:06,764
One bad stud

328
00:30:24,574 --> 00:30:27,201
You know, you're making
things real hard on yourself.

329
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:32,081
You act nice, you and me fall in love
for a week or two and then I let you go.

330
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:33,791
Nobody gets hurt.

331
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:38,421
You see,
I ain't such a bad guy.

332
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:43,426
I just get excited
around pretty girls.

333
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:55,813
Oh, well, one bad stud

334
00:30:55,813 --> 00:31:01,861
One bad stud

335
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:04,655
I said, one, one, one, one

336
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:31,641
From now on either of you make any
mistakes, I'm making you walk home.

337
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:33,684
Walk? I'm not gonna walk
around here, I'd get killed.

338
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:36,270
You got it.
What about you, McCoy?

339
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:40,566
Are we gonna do it or are
we gonna talk about it?

340
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:42,151
You're right.

341
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:02,046
The main drag
is around here somewhere.

342
00:32:04,465 --> 00:32:08,803
What the hell's that? Guess
you don't know who I am, do you?

343
00:32:11,347 --> 00:32:13,349
Things have gotten kind of
funny around here.

344
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:16,602
All kinds of strangers coming
around, sneaking through the alleys.

345
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:19,772
What the hell we talking to this
creep for? Let's get out of here.

346
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:24,527
My gosh, you're scared. What's
even funnier, you're afraid of me.

347
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:27,905
I'm just trying to get away from
you. We got some business here.

348
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:32,118
Oh, you're dumb,
and you're short. Real short.

349
00:32:34,412 --> 00:32:38,541
You're after that girl, aren't
you? What makes you say that?

350
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:41,085
Come down a back alley, 10:00 at
night carrying a bunch of guns,

351
00:32:41,085 --> 00:32:43,588
I don't figure you're here to give
The Battery a new coat of paint.

352
00:32:43,588 --> 00:32:46,507
Where they keeping her?
Torchies, second floor.

353
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:49,427
Don't tell them I told
you, though. Pay him.

354
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:53,139
Yeah, pay me.
I'm not gonna pay this jerk!

355
00:32:53,181 --> 00:32:55,933
Listen, shithead, you give
him some of your money,

356
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:57,602
or I'll give him
some of your money.

357
00:32:57,602 --> 00:32:59,312
Don't call me "shithead. "

358
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:01,355
Hey, you gotta
keep moving forward.

359
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:04,275
That's the whole point of things,
and I thank you now, I appreciate it.

360
00:33:04,275 --> 00:33:06,402
Why don't you buy some soap?

361
00:33:07,612 --> 00:33:10,531
I don't need this guy
to tell me she's in Torchies.

362
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:13,451
I said they had her
at Torchies. I am a shithead.

363
00:33:36,015 --> 00:33:37,725
Okay, Fish,
you get back to the car.

364
00:33:37,767 --> 00:33:41,646
I want you in that doorway over there
in 15 minutes and I mean 15 minutes.

365
00:33:41,646 --> 00:33:44,065
Are you crazy? They'll notice
me in a second down there.

366
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:45,107
Don't worry about that.

367
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:47,193
I'm gonna give them a couple
of other things to worry about.

368
00:33:47,235 --> 00:33:49,737
What about her? I thought she's
supposed to do the driving?

369
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:52,281
Get moving! And you better
be ready when we get there.

370
00:33:58,329 --> 00:34:00,414
Do you trust him
or are you just desperate?

371
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:02,416
You take the front entrance.
I'm going topside.

372
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:05,920
If you can work your way upstairs to
help me out, fine, if not I'll handle it!

373
00:34:05,962 --> 00:34:09,674
Just what I always wanted to
do, Cody, take on the Bombers.

374
00:34:31,237 --> 00:34:33,030
Hey, baby!

375
00:34:56,596 --> 00:34:58,931
I've been around the world

376
00:34:58,973 --> 00:35:01,267
And every man bleeds the same

377
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:05,354
But when the lights are dim

378
00:35:05,396 --> 00:35:07,773
You never know who's to blame

379
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:13,154
I don't want no scars to show

380
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:16,115
I don't want no one to know

381
00:35:16,407 --> 00:35:20,578
So I'll be killing time
in the blue shadows

382
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:26,083
No other place for me to go

383
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:29,170
No other place for dying slow

384
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:33,883
So I'll be killing time
in the blue shadows

385
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:39,805
I've been around the world

386
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:43,017
I take credit
for the things I've done

387
00:35:44,435 --> 00:35:46,729
But when the lights are dim

388
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:49,023
I'm not the only guilty one

389
00:35:52,026 --> 00:35:54,945
I don't want no scars to show

390
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:57,823
I don't want no one to know

391
00:35:57,865 --> 00:36:01,994
So I'll be killing time
in the blue shadows

392
00:36:02,453 --> 00:36:05,039
Hey! How you doing, babe?
Come around here much?

393
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:07,625
Only when I wanna check out
some real action.

394
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:10,586
Well, you're talking to
the right guy. Says who?

395
00:36:10,628 --> 00:36:13,506
Says me. I like a guy
that's got confidence.

396
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:15,299
All right.

397
00:36:43,494 --> 00:36:45,329
No, that Way's
the card game, huh?

398
00:36:45,371 --> 00:36:47,873
We're going down here.
We got a party room.

399
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:56,340
Check it out, huh, baby? This is
the party room. How you like it, huh?

400
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:00,261
I've had a lot of good times
here, so, let's party, huh?

401
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:06,267
Hey, killer. Can I take my jacket off first?
Yeah, you can take off whatever you want.

402
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:09,311
All right.
Now, listen to me, buddy.

403
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,524
There's just one thing I want you
to do, and that is to keep quiet.

404
00:37:13,524 --> 00:37:15,025
Hey, come on, babe,
what is this thing loaded?

405
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:17,153
We're gonna play a little game.
You Bombers are gonna like it.

406
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:18,821
It's called "lights out. "

407
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:21,282
No other place for me to go

408
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:23,659
No other place for dying slow

409
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:29,081
So I'll be killing
just killing time

410
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:34,044
So I'll be killing time
in the blue shadows

411
00:37:38,716 --> 00:37:40,342
I've been around the world

412
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:43,304
I take credit
for the things I've done

413
00:37:45,014 --> 00:37:47,224
But when the lights are dim

414
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:49,393
I'm not the only guilty one

415
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:52,730
Knock, knock.

416
00:37:52,772 --> 00:37:55,691
I don't want no scars to show

417
00:37:55,733 --> 00:37:58,527
I don't want no one to know

418
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:02,782
So I'll be killing time
in the blue shadows

419
00:38:30,184 --> 00:38:32,269
Go ahead and take that money,
sweetie.

420
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:34,980
You better pray you make
it out of The Battery.

421
00:38:35,022 --> 00:38:37,566
I don't think
she's after the money.

422
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:16,313
You know poker's
a real interesting game

423
00:39:16,355 --> 00:39:19,400
especially when you've got
all the best cards!

424
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,153
Next time it'll be right in your
nuts, pal. You know what I mean?

425
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,841
Guys, it's been a slice.

426
00:39:47,094 --> 00:39:49,096
Who are you?
McCoy. I'm a big fan.

427
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:51,056
Yeah, great,
come on, let's go.

428
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:56,061
Who is that guy?

429
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:02,693
Look out, it's surrounded! Get
this guy out of The Battery.

430
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:04,486
Move it! Move it!

431
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:16,081
This way. Follow me!

432
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:31,513
Jesus, Ellen, am I glad to see you.
I thought you were gone forever.

433
00:40:31,555 --> 00:40:33,599
Cody, get in! This ain't no
time for checking out the sights!

434
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:35,100
Take off! I'm gonna run
these guys for awhile.

435
00:40:35,142 --> 00:40:36,810
I'm staying with you...
You're not going with him!

436
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:38,437
You stay in the car!
Stay with your boyfriend!

437
00:40:38,479 --> 00:40:40,022
McCoy, meet me at
the Grant Street underpass.

438
00:40:40,064 --> 00:40:43,442
Right. If we don't see
you, Cody, have a nice life!

439
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,918
McCoy, can't you drive
this car any faster?

440
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,628
I don't want any Bombers
sneaking up on us!

441
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,255
Let's get our asses
out of here real quick!

442
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:48,340
And where's this Grant Street
anyway? I never heard of it before!

443
00:41:48,382 --> 00:41:51,468
You sure you know where you're going?
Turn it off, Fish! You sound pathetic!

444
00:41:59,143 --> 00:42:00,269
Well.

445
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:06,358
Looks like I finally ran into someone
that likes to play <i>as</i> rough <i>as</i> I do.

446
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,655
Yeah, this must be your lucky
night. I'm lucky? I guess maybe I am.

447
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:16,827
And you're dumb. Real dumb, if
you think you can pull this off.

448
00:42:16,827 --> 00:42:20,831
I think you're forgetting
something. I got the gun.

449
00:42:20,873 --> 00:42:26,003
I can get guns, smart guy. Lots of them.
Now why don't you tell me your name.

450
00:42:26,712 --> 00:42:29,381
Tom Cody. Pleased to meet you.

451
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:36,013
I'll be coming for her, and
I'll be coming for you too.

452
00:42:36,472 --> 00:42:39,016
Sure, you will,
and I'll be waiting.

453
00:43:29,566 --> 00:43:32,236
Listen, I say we give it a couple of
minutes then get out of here, okay?

454
00:43:32,236 --> 00:43:33,403
What are you talking about?

455
00:43:33,445 --> 00:43:36,949
I'm talking about saving our ass.
We got a lot to live for, Ellen.

456
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:39,159
He came and he got me! I'm
not going back without him.

457
00:43:39,201 --> 00:43:42,246
Don't worry about him. He's getting
paid a lot of money to look after Raven.

458
00:43:42,246 --> 00:43:44,540
What money? What do you think
he's doing this for love?

459
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:46,792
You think he's doing this
'cause he's your biggest fan?

460
00:43:46,834 --> 00:43:49,128
He's getting paid, dear.
He takes his chances!

461
00:43:49,169 --> 00:43:51,630
Hey! Too bad, Billy.

462
00:43:52,131 --> 00:43:55,008
Looks like Ellen's old flame
decided to show up.

463
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:14,987
Okay, we're on the move.

464
00:44:16,446 --> 00:44:18,240
What's this old flame stuff?

465
00:44:18,282 --> 00:44:20,075
Didn't you know?
Ellen used to go with Cody,

466
00:44:20,117 --> 00:44:23,453
real hot and heavy from what
I hear. You know what I mean?

467
00:44:23,453 --> 00:44:24,913
What, is she kidding?

468
00:44:24,955 --> 00:44:28,584
Let's not get into it now, okay,
Billy? Hard news, huh, shorty?

469
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:52,816
Look, Cody, we've had our differences,
but it looks like we got it made now, huh?

470
00:44:52,816 --> 00:44:54,610
We'll just zoom along here
for a couple of hours,

471
00:44:54,651 --> 00:44:55,777
then we're home and dry.

472
00:44:55,819 --> 00:44:59,489
I got news for you, it ain't that
simple. We gotta bury the car.

473
00:44:59,823 --> 00:45:01,992
Bury the car? What are you
talking about "bury the car"?

474
00:45:01,992 --> 00:45:04,119
He means we're gonna
get rid of it, stupid.

475
00:45:04,161 --> 00:45:06,496
He's gonna get rid of the car?
What's wrong with the car?

476
00:45:06,496 --> 00:45:07,956
This is what I'm paying you
all this money for?

477
00:45:07,998 --> 00:45:09,791
To come up
with these brilliant ideas?

478
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:13,212
Why don't we just hand ourselves back
over to Raven and ask him to shoot us?

479
00:45:43,075 --> 00:45:45,786
You two go ahead. I wanna talk
alone with Tom for a minute.

480
00:45:45,786 --> 00:45:48,455
What are you talking about?
What are you going with him for?

481
00:45:50,165 --> 00:45:52,000
Hey, I don't like
the way this looks, Ellen.

482
00:45:52,251 --> 00:45:54,962
I'm paying the bills around
here. How about some respect?

483
00:45:59,216 --> 00:46:02,302
So what do you wanna talk to me
about? I got a lot to say to you, Tom.

484
00:46:02,344 --> 00:46:04,346
No, you don't.
You have nothing to say to me.

485
00:46:04,388 --> 00:46:06,640
You wanna talk to somebody,
go talk to your boyfriend.

486
00:46:06,682 --> 00:46:08,892
Look, what was I supposed
to do? I had all that work.

487
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:11,436
Things were going real good. Things
were starting to happen for me.

488
00:46:11,478 --> 00:46:13,480
Yeah, so, bye-bye,
Tom, right?

489
00:46:13,522 --> 00:46:14,856
You're the one who took off
and joined the army.

490
00:46:14,898 --> 00:46:16,566
Let's forget all this.
It's history.

491
00:46:16,608 --> 00:46:20,445
From now on I'm just like you. I do
what I'm good at and I do it for money.

492
00:46:20,487 --> 00:46:21,822
Is that why
you came and got me?

493
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:25,033
That's right. Billy Fish
is paying me 10 grand.

494
00:46:25,075 --> 00:46:29,830
I just can't believe you'd do that.
Maybe you'd better get used to the idea.

495
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:32,791
I wonder what
they're talking about?

496
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:35,210
Who says they're talking?
Cute.

497
00:46:35,252 --> 00:46:38,338
It was just a joke, man,
you know what I mean?

498
00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:41,383
How big a thing
do you think they had anyway?

499
00:46:41,425 --> 00:46:45,137
From what I hear it was real major.
Yeah, well, she's with me now.

500
00:46:45,595 --> 00:46:48,098
Yeah, right. Against a big
tough, good-looking guy like you,

501
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:50,142
Cody don't stand a chance.

502
00:46:59,151 --> 00:47:01,403
I hope you two got
everything straightened out.

503
00:47:01,445 --> 00:47:05,824
Yeah, we got a lot straightened
out. It was a real eye opener.

504
00:47:05,866 --> 00:47:09,995
I think I hurt your girlfriend's
feelings. I'm real sorry about it.

505
00:47:10,037 --> 00:47:12,956
What does he mean he hurt
your feelings? What'd he say?

506
00:47:12,998 --> 00:47:15,876
Did he say anything about me?
What'd he say? Tell me!

507
00:47:36,313 --> 00:47:39,483
I'm tired

508
00:47:40,692 --> 00:47:42,652
I'm thirsty

509
00:47:45,072 --> 00:47:47,824
I'm wild eyed

510
00:47:49,117 --> 00:47:51,370
In my misery

511
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:56,583
Timeless

512
00:47:57,626 --> 00:48:00,462
In your finery

513
00:48:02,506 --> 00:48:04,508
A high price

514
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:08,845
For your luxury

515
00:48:12,432 --> 00:48:14,684
Sorcerer

516
00:48:15,769 --> 00:48:18,271
Who is the master

517
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:24,736
Man and woman
on a star stream

518
00:48:24,903 --> 00:48:28,698
In the middle of a snow dream

519
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:31,743
Sorcerer

520
00:48:32,994 --> 00:48:36,415
Show me the high life

521
00:48:38,375 --> 00:48:40,585
Come over

522
00:48:42,045 --> 00:48:45,424
Let me put you on ice

523
00:48:52,389 --> 00:48:54,057
I'm tired

524
00:48:56,184 --> 00:48:59,604
When I need you badly

525
00:49:01,106 --> 00:49:03,024
Wild eyed

526
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:08,155
In the middle of your dream

527
00:49:09,823 --> 00:49:11,408
Timeless

528
00:49:14,536 --> 00:49:17,914
Hey. Hi, you guys. Hey, what's
the hurry? Where you guys going?

529
00:49:17,956 --> 00:49:20,709
We're nobody, we're going
nowhere. Nobody goes nowhere.

530
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:24,588
Look, knock it off, we're not
interested in conversation, okay, moron?

531
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:30,343
I know you. I know who you are, dig?
I love your stuff so much, I really do.

532
00:49:30,385 --> 00:49:31,511
Look, if you love me so much,

533
00:49:31,553 --> 00:49:33,263
why don't you just go away
and leave us alone.

534
00:49:33,305 --> 00:49:35,140
No, look,
I'm your biggest fan, really.

535
00:49:35,182 --> 00:49:36,933
Let me go with you, okay?
I won't be any trouble.

536
00:49:36,975 --> 00:49:39,060
And I'll tell you guys something,
you gotta get off the street,

537
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:43,106
'cause the cops know the guys that hit
The Battery will be coming through here.

538
00:49:43,148 --> 00:49:44,399
Shit!

539
00:49:44,441 --> 00:49:46,234
We gotta get
a new set of wheels.

540
00:49:46,276 --> 00:49:50,071
Great, we just got rid of the old
wheels. Wonderful leadership, Cody.

541
00:50:00,874 --> 00:50:04,044
Hey, what's the matter with you? Are
you looking to get yourself run over?

542
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:07,631
Me and my friends need a lift.
So what? This ain't no muni bus!

543
00:50:07,631 --> 00:50:09,257
Need a lift real bad.

544
00:50:09,299 --> 00:50:15,514
Now look, let me make it real clear.
Nobody tells me where to take my bus.

545
00:50:15,555 --> 00:50:16,973
You dig?

546
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:19,935
Well, we're very flexible.

547
00:50:19,976 --> 00:50:22,062
We'll take you where you wanna
go. Anywhere you wanna go.

548
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:23,688
You just say the word
and we're with you.

549
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:26,900
You folks just hop right in.
Just make yourself at home.

550
00:50:26,942 --> 00:50:28,485
I'm driving.

551
00:50:28,985 --> 00:50:31,738
Hey, Bird, what the hell
you doing, man?

552
00:50:49,589 --> 00:50:51,132
Hey, hOW you guys doing?

553
00:50:51,174 --> 00:50:53,843
My name's McCoy. Don't worry,
we're not gonna hurt you none.

554
00:50:53,885 --> 00:50:56,846
That's great.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

555
00:50:56,888 --> 00:51:00,308
We're the Sorels. I'm Bird.
These are my associates.

556
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:03,728
This is Lester. My man
B.J., and that's Reggie.

557
00:51:07,232 --> 00:51:09,943
Aren't you Ellen Aim?
That's right. It is Ellen Aim.

558
00:51:09,985 --> 00:51:12,654
Hey, Ellen, you guys need
an opener or anything?

559
00:51:12,696 --> 00:51:13,738
I mean, we're good.

560
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:16,116
I mean, we're real good, but we just
can't seem to get anything going.

561
00:51:16,157 --> 00:51:18,868
Hey, look, what gives? I handle
the management and the booking.

562
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:21,997
Now, you guys just shut up
and leave Ellen alone.

563
00:51:22,038 --> 00:51:24,374
Look, I know how tough it
can be getting the right gig.

564
00:51:24,416 --> 00:51:25,834
Baby, you don't
even begin to know.

565
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:28,878
Man, what did I tell you guys?
Will you just cool it?

566
00:51:34,884 --> 00:51:39,556
Hey, if you got any chance at all of
missing the cops, it's through here.

567
00:51:40,348 --> 00:51:44,853
Yeah, so what are our
chances? Horrible and terrible.

568
00:51:45,312 --> 00:51:46,688
Oh, that's just great.

569
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:49,566
Look, we don't wanna mess
with any of these Ardmore cops.

570
00:51:49,608 --> 00:51:51,026
They busted me
a couple of years ago,

571
00:51:51,067 --> 00:51:53,570
threw my ass right in jail
'cause I wouldn't pay them off.

572
00:51:53,612 --> 00:51:55,238
What'd they bust you for?

573
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,491
Disturbing the peace. They said I
got out of line in some bar, you know?

574
00:51:58,533 --> 00:52:00,952
Great.
I love a girl with class.

575
00:52:33,902 --> 00:52:38,239
This is great, just great. You
wanna help change this tire, shorty?

576
00:52:38,281 --> 00:52:40,950
Changing flat tires isn't
exactly my line of work, dear.

577
00:52:40,992 --> 00:52:43,620
If that's the case, then
why don't you just shut up?

578
00:52:43,662 --> 00:52:45,789
Why don't you just shut up?

579
00:52:50,543 --> 00:52:52,671
Then I try and write songs,
you know.

580
00:52:52,712 --> 00:52:55,674
I just can't seem to figure out how
to do it right the way you do it.

581
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:58,259
You know, I can't figure out how you
work out the rhymes and the melodies

582
00:52:58,301 --> 00:52:59,844
and you make it all come out.

583
00:52:59,886 --> 00:53:02,972
Somebody else writes the songs,
Billy buys them or steals them,

584
00:53:02,972 --> 00:53:04,182
I can't write for shit.

585
00:53:04,224 --> 00:53:07,394
I always thought those were
your songs. I just sing them.

586
00:53:07,435 --> 00:53:10,105
Yeah, but when you sing them,
you make it yours.

587
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:11,898
That's the way it is, right?

588
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:14,025
I guess so. Who knows?

589
00:53:14,651 --> 00:53:18,238
The famous Sorels sure put a
lot of money into that bus, huh?

590
00:53:18,738 --> 00:53:21,241
Listen, Cody, I didn't know you had
a thing with Ellen in the old days.

591
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:22,617
You better get some smarts.

592
00:53:22,659 --> 00:53:25,036
Learn to adjust to the fact that
you're out of the picture now.

593
00:53:25,078 --> 00:53:28,873
You see, Cody, I do things for her.
Things that a guy like you could never do.

594
00:53:28,915 --> 00:53:31,167
Things that matter
in the real world.

595
00:53:36,339 --> 00:53:37,632
You know something?

596
00:53:37,674 --> 00:53:42,178
The only trouble with kicking the shit
out of you is it would be too easy.

597
00:53:48,518 --> 00:53:50,937
You keep your hands
off the suit, buddy.

598
00:53:54,691 --> 00:53:58,653
Come on, hurry the hell up with that
flat tire, already, let's get going.

599
00:53:58,695 --> 00:54:02,615
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one

600
00:54:02,824 --> 00:54:09,539
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one

601
00:54:09,581 --> 00:54:11,124
Countdown to love

602
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:12,167
Ten

603
00:54:12,208 --> 00:54:15,128
Remember when you didn't
love me

604
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:16,254
Nine

605
00:54:16,296 --> 00:54:19,549
Now all the time
you're thinking of me

606
00:54:19,674 --> 00:54:23,845
Eight, life is great
You're all I'm living for

607
00:54:24,012 --> 00:54:27,557
This is my countdown to love

608
00:54:27,766 --> 00:54:31,686
Oh, this is
my countdown to love

609
00:54:32,896 --> 00:54:36,691
You are the one love
in my life

610
00:54:36,858 --> 00:54:39,986
I know you feel that way too

611
00:54:41,362 --> 00:54:45,158
Oh, what a thrill
when I'm holdin' you near

612
00:54:45,283 --> 00:54:49,412
All of my wild dreams
come true

613
00:54:49,537 --> 00:54:50,580
Four

614
00:54:50,622 --> 00:54:53,750
Forevermore you'll be my lover

615
00:54:53,792 --> 00:54:55,001
Three

616
00:54:55,043 --> 00:54:57,962
It's you for me
there'll never be another

617
00:54:58,004 --> 00:54:59,005
Two

618
00:54:59,047 --> 00:55:02,592
Together forever
we'll be <i>as</i> one

619
00:55:04,052 --> 00:55:05,637
Pretty good, you guys.

620
00:55:06,429 --> 00:55:08,181
Oh, this is
my countdown to love

621
00:55:08,223 --> 00:55:11,643
Cody? All right, Ellen,
Baby Doll, down in back.

622
00:55:11,684 --> 00:55:15,271
Fish, McCoy, we're working for the
Sorels. Fish, you're the manager.

623
00:55:15,313 --> 00:55:16,397
I'm way ahead of you, Cody.

624
00:55:16,439 --> 00:55:18,858
What, do you think I gotta be a
genius to know what you're going for?

625
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:21,277
I'll handle this.
I'll talk us through.

626
00:55:36,376 --> 00:55:40,296
Hey, guys, how's it going? I'm
the bus driver here for the Sorels.

627
00:55:40,338 --> 00:55:43,550
We're on our way to play a gig
at an after hours joint.

628
00:55:43,591 --> 00:55:45,593
The Sorels. The singers.
You know them, right?

629
00:55:45,635 --> 00:55:49,305
No. Never heard of them. You know
what's going on here, don't you?

630
00:55:49,347 --> 00:55:51,724
Look, man, all I know
is we're running real late.

631
00:55:51,766 --> 00:55:55,144
Well, babe, some outfitjust broke into
The Battery and burned half of it down.

632
00:55:55,186 --> 00:55:56,354
Really?

633
00:55:56,396 --> 00:55:58,314
Knock off the crap, will you?

634
00:55:58,356 --> 00:56:00,567
As far <i>as</i> I'm concerned anybody
that goes into The Battery

635
00:56:00,608 --> 00:56:02,443
and does some damage
deserves a medal.

636
00:56:02,485 --> 00:56:05,405
Well, let me tell you how we look
at it. Look, cut the shit, okay?

637
00:56:05,446 --> 00:56:08,283
You guys got a big job to do, we're
trying to get where we're going.

638
00:56:08,324 --> 00:56:12,579
Now, let us through, or you wanna come
to some kind of financial arrangement?

639
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,205
Well, what do you
think, Harry?

640
00:56:14,247 --> 00:56:18,126
Well, I think what we got here
is a model citizen.

641
00:56:18,167 --> 00:56:20,670
I knew you guys
talked my language.

642
00:56:24,632 --> 00:56:26,217
Keep it coming.

643
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:30,138
You guys take a big bite.
That's right.

644
00:56:30,179 --> 00:56:32,891
Nice to see there's some
integrity left on the force.

645
00:56:32,932 --> 00:56:36,853
You know, you're just a little
too anxious to buy us off.

646
00:56:36,895 --> 00:56:39,272
Spade musicians
with a big wad of money.

647
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:42,609
All right,
everybody off the bus!

648
00:56:46,154 --> 00:56:48,698
All right, now this is
how we're gonna play it.

649
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:52,410
You're gonna walk off this bus
like there's nothing wrong. Get me?

650
00:57:00,001 --> 00:57:03,254
All right, down on
the ground! Do it! Now!

651
00:57:04,505 --> 00:57:05,798
Get over there!

652
00:57:07,383 --> 00:57:10,887
Don't worry about it, fellows.
We'll be out of your face in no time.

653
00:57:10,929 --> 00:57:14,098
You know, some of you guys
got some cute little asses.

654
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:17,226
Be a real shame if I had
to blow them off! Stay down!

655
00:57:17,393 --> 00:57:18,478
Oh, shit!

656
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:23,316
All right!

657
00:57:23,358 --> 00:57:24,651
Son-of-a-bitch!

658
00:57:31,157 --> 00:57:33,701
Come on, man, let's get
out of here! Come on!

659
00:57:51,177 --> 00:57:52,345
Go! Go!

660
00:57:54,931 --> 00:57:56,474
Shut the hell up!

661
00:57:56,516 --> 00:57:59,769
McCoy, pull out in a back
alley, we're gonna dump the bus.

662
00:58:00,186 --> 00:58:02,480
First he dumps the car,
now he's dumping the bus?

663
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:11,322
Code 99! Code 99.
Blockade at Cross and Ardmore.

664
00:58:11,656 --> 00:58:13,658
Suspects armed and dangerous!

665
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:16,494
Repeat, armed and dangerous!
Broke blockade!

666
00:58:16,536 --> 00:58:20,581
Heading north on Ardmore.
Cannot pursue. Do you copy?

667
00:58:21,457 --> 00:58:24,794
God damn it, this is the blockade
at Ardmore, come back to me.

668
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:36,764
Come on.

669
00:58:58,578 --> 00:59:00,079
Come on! Come on!

670
00:59:10,131 --> 00:59:11,632
We had a $1,000 in that bus!

671
00:59:11,674 --> 00:59:15,470
I lost my clothes, the luggage is
gone, all the sheet music is gone!

672
00:59:15,511 --> 00:59:16,554
This is great.

673
00:59:16,596 --> 00:59:19,182
We're on our way to the
Richmond. No bus, no nothing.

674
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:21,017
You shouldn't have stopped,
Bird.

675
00:59:39,035 --> 00:59:41,704
He ain't a real
social kind of guy, is he?

676
00:59:42,288 --> 00:59:44,874
Really? Gee, I think
he's a real sweetheart.

677
00:59:44,999 --> 00:59:47,835
Cut him some slack, will you?
He was there for you tonight.

678
00:59:47,877 --> 00:59:49,337
Yeah, he really
earned his money.

679
00:59:49,378 --> 00:59:51,631
You know, you got a real
funny way of saying thanks

680
00:59:51,672 --> 00:59:53,007
when someone saves your ass.

681
00:59:53,049 --> 00:59:55,218
Why don't you go sit with
your pal Billy over there.

682
00:59:55,259 --> 00:59:57,845
I guess he's more
your kind of guy.

683
00:59:57,887 --> 01:00:00,056
Yeah, I think maybe I will.

684
01:00:14,403 --> 01:00:18,366
Don't worry, babe, everything's
gonna be okay from now on.

685
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:22,829
We're gonna be great.

686
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:57,238
Hey, Reva, Ellen Aim's back.
And guess what? Tom's with her.

687
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,907
Is he okay? Oh, he
looked all right to me.

688
01:01:00,908 --> 01:01:02,118
Chief?

689
01:01:20,595 --> 01:01:22,054
Tom.

690
01:01:23,347 --> 01:01:26,893
Reva, cut it out. We made it.
Everybody's in one piece.

691
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:30,646
What about that, Ellen?
You okay?

692
01:01:32,732 --> 01:01:35,151
Yeah, I'm all right, I guess.

693
01:01:35,193 --> 01:01:37,612
No, she's not. She's tired,
and she's been roughed up.

694
01:01:37,653 --> 01:01:40,489
I'm gonna take her back to the
hotel so she can get some rest.

695
01:01:40,531 --> 01:01:43,618
This whole thing started 'cause I
had to do a gig in this shit hole.

696
01:01:43,659 --> 01:01:46,829
I should've stayed the
hell away from this dump!

697
01:01:47,496 --> 01:01:49,498
Is that the way
you feel about it, Ellen?

698
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:52,126
Yeah, I guess I just wanna
get away from here.

699
01:01:52,168 --> 01:01:53,961
Get back on the road.

700
01:01:54,003 --> 01:01:57,673
Now you're talking, kiddo.
Come on, let's get out of here.

701
01:01:58,591 --> 01:02:01,636
I hate you for taking money
to come and get me.

702
01:02:04,096 --> 01:02:06,182
That's telling him, Ellen.

703
01:02:25,243 --> 01:02:28,746
I guess she doesn't like you much,
Cody. She doesn't seem real thankful.

704
01:02:28,788 --> 01:02:31,374
Yeah, one thing about you,
Cooley, you catch on real quick.

705
01:02:31,415 --> 01:02:33,793
Yeah, that's right, Buddy,
and I get the job done.

706
01:02:33,834 --> 01:02:36,754
Good. Because I think
it's just starting.

707
01:03:08,244 --> 01:03:11,789
What the hell does he
wanna talk about? Tom Cody.

708
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:16,877
I want Tom Cody.

709
01:03:17,878 --> 01:03:20,798
I wanna nail that son-of-a-bitch's
head to the sidewalk

710
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:24,218
under that marquee
that says Ellen Aim on it?

711
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:27,847
And just to prove to you,
I'm gonna be a nice guy,

712
01:03:27,888 --> 01:03:30,766
I'm coming in
with just two of my men.

713
01:03:31,058 --> 01:03:35,062
After I take care of Cody,
there'll be no more trouble.

714
01:03:37,773 --> 01:03:41,610
You do your job, man.
Keep the peace.

715
01:04:09,055 --> 01:04:11,515
Hey, Cody, I need a drink.
Come on, let's get out of here.

716
01:04:11,557 --> 01:04:14,018
Maybe I can get lucky and pick
a fight with that bartender.

717
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:15,770
No, not this time.

718
01:04:24,612 --> 01:04:28,157
Hey, McCoy, look, I'll get
you your money later, okay?

719
01:04:28,616 --> 01:04:31,118
Is that all you got to say is,
"I'll get your money to you later. "

720
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:34,121
Yeah, that's all I gotta say.
What else do you wanna hear?

721
01:04:34,163 --> 01:04:35,790
Hey, look,
I did real good back there.

722
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:39,627
So what? I'm all out of medals,
besides you're getting paid.

723
01:04:42,713 --> 01:04:47,385
You know, Reva, Ellen Aim
was right about one thing,

724
01:04:47,426 --> 01:04:49,136
your brother's a jerk.

725
01:05:08,155 --> 01:05:11,158
What's your problem? You're
feeling pretty sorry for yourself...

726
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,493
Don't start on me, Reva.

727
01:05:12,493 --> 01:05:14,245
She comes back to town,
tells you and everybody else

728
01:05:14,286 --> 01:05:15,329
it doesn't mean a goddamn...

729
01:05:15,329 --> 01:05:18,666
Yeah and the worst part is she
runs off with that creep Billy Fish.

730
01:05:18,707 --> 01:05:20,835
You know, Tom, I didn't ask
you to go out and get Ellen Aim

731
01:05:20,876 --> 01:05:22,670
because she looks great
on stage.

732
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:26,340
Well, what the hell do you
care... I care about you!

733
01:05:26,382 --> 01:05:27,591
And this town!

734
01:05:27,633 --> 01:05:30,845
Look, if you're gonna fight, you're
supposed to fight for something.

735
01:05:30,886 --> 01:05:33,180
You and Billy Fish are the
same. You're both selfish!

736
01:05:33,222 --> 01:05:35,683
All you two
are really worried about...

737
01:05:36,183 --> 01:05:39,478
Hi, Ed. I came to talk to your brother.

738
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,188
Come on outside.

739
01:05:51,824 --> 01:05:55,578
Raven says he has to face you
alone. Right here in The Richmond.

740
01:05:56,620 --> 01:06:01,542
I'm ordering you to get out of town,
Tom. I want you on a train tonight.

741
01:06:01,584 --> 01:06:03,210
If Raven comes in here
to face you,

742
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:05,796
I'll be waiting for him
right here with a lot of guns.

743
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:08,257
I'm throwing his ass in jail.

744
01:06:08,299 --> 01:06:11,302
I am not gonna sit around
and watch two maniacs

745
01:06:11,343 --> 01:06:14,263
play out some little game
about personal honor.

746
01:06:14,305 --> 01:06:17,057
I want you gone. If you're
still in town tomorrow morning,

747
01:06:17,099 --> 01:06:20,394
I'm throwing your ass in jail
right next to Raven.

748
01:06:27,151 --> 01:06:30,112
Look, you did real good
rescuing her, Tom.

749
01:06:30,154 --> 01:06:33,657
You surprised me. 'Cause I
didn't think you had it in you.

750
01:06:33,699 --> 01:06:37,411
Now, surprise me again.
Do something else real good,

751
01:06:37,453 --> 01:06:39,497
be on that train tonight.

752
01:07:12,613 --> 01:07:15,282
Yeah, come in.
Hey, I'll get It.

753
01:07:15,741 --> 01:07:17,076
Who is It?

754
01:07:19,787 --> 01:07:24,500
What the hell are you still doing here? Oh,
hey, look, see you guys later, all right?

755
01:07:31,924 --> 01:07:35,553
I've been expecting you I
know what you want. Ten grand.

756
01:07:36,136 --> 01:07:39,181
I'm <i>as</i> good <i>as</i> my word.
I pay on time.

757
01:07:39,223 --> 01:07:41,100
You know you play rough,
Cody, but you do a good job.

758
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:42,142
You should do
a little more work for me

759
01:07:42,184 --> 01:07:43,894
when you get a taste of
what that money'll bring you.

760
01:07:43,936 --> 01:07:46,397
Then you'll realize I'm the
one with the brains around here

761
01:07:46,438 --> 01:07:48,315
and you'll start
treating me a bit nicer.

762
01:07:50,484 --> 01:07:52,820
You know, nobody ever had
a hold on me the way you did.

763
01:07:52,861 --> 01:07:54,613
I would have done
anything for you.

764
01:07:54,655 --> 01:07:57,157
A long time ago I would have
thought you were worth it.

765
01:07:57,199 --> 01:07:59,034
Not anymore, babe.

766
01:08:01,161 --> 01:08:02,830
Where do you get off
talking to her like that?

767
01:08:02,871 --> 01:08:04,873
She's way out of your league,
musclehead.

768
01:08:04,915 --> 01:08:08,919
This is the grand I promised
McCoy. You can keep the rest.

769
01:08:14,925 --> 01:08:18,137
You know what's wrong
with that guy? He's stupid.

770
01:08:20,514 --> 01:08:21,682
I'm sorry, Billy.

771
01:08:21,682 --> 01:08:24,351
What are you sorry about? Where
are you going? Where you going?

772
01:08:26,103 --> 01:08:27,229
Tom!

773
01:08:28,022 --> 01:08:31,442
Tom, wait!

774
01:08:32,735 --> 01:08:34,403
What was I supposed to do?

775
01:08:34,445 --> 01:08:37,531
I hadn't heard from you in two years.
You didn't even write me a letter.

776
01:08:37,573 --> 01:08:39,908
What did I do
that was so wrong?

777
01:08:56,258 --> 01:08:58,135
You gotta go away.

778
01:08:58,177 --> 01:09:00,554
You fought enough fights,
you can let this one go.

779
01:09:00,554 --> 01:09:04,224
With both of us gone, maybe...
What do you mean "both of us"?

780
01:09:04,266 --> 01:09:07,603
Us! I wanna go with you.

781
01:09:08,646 --> 01:09:10,439
We could be together.

782
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:16,320
You'd really come along with
me? In two seconds I would.

783
01:09:18,781 --> 01:09:20,032
Please?

784
01:09:47,101 --> 01:09:50,312
Well, if it isn't
my old pal, Tom Cody.

785
01:09:50,354 --> 01:09:53,482
How's it going?
Great till you got here.

786
01:09:53,524 --> 01:09:55,734
I've just been talking
things over with Clyde.

787
01:09:55,776 --> 01:09:57,945
You remember he and I
used to be real close.

788
01:09:57,986 --> 01:09:59,947
Hey, Tom, tequila, right?

789
01:10:07,579 --> 01:10:09,164
Here's what I owe you.

790
01:10:11,917 --> 01:10:16,255
You did real good back there. I
couldn't have got her out without you.

791
01:10:17,548 --> 01:10:20,300
Maybe I rode you a little
harder than I should have.

792
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:24,680
Don't get sentimental on me. I
wouldn't know how to handle it.

793
01:10:37,735 --> 01:10:40,404
Hey, I got a problem with
Ellen I gotta talk to you about.

794
01:10:40,446 --> 01:10:42,698
Yeah, I understand
about these kind of things.

795
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:46,952
You know, Cody, I was actually in
love once myself. It didn't work out.

796
01:10:46,994 --> 01:10:48,370
You're the kind
that makes bad picks, huh?

797
01:10:48,412 --> 01:10:51,749
He was the worst. He lied to
me all the time, cheated on me.

798
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:54,543
Well, if I ever run into
him, I'll give him your best.

799
01:10:54,585 --> 01:10:57,296
Of course, you know,
that's before I was a soldier.

800
01:11:02,426 --> 01:11:07,097
You're real crazy about Ellen, aren't
you? Yeah, I don't know. I guess I am.

801
01:11:07,139 --> 01:11:09,850
Hey, there's nothing wrong with
it. Nothing to be embarrassed about.

802
01:11:09,892 --> 01:11:12,102
I ain't embarrassed. I just
know it ain't gonna work out.

803
01:11:12,144 --> 01:11:15,522
Ellen and I are going in different
directions. It's nobody's fault.

804
01:11:15,522 --> 01:11:19,401
Maybe you're right, 'cause you don't
look like no back-up singer to me.

805
01:11:19,443 --> 01:11:22,905
Look, I'm gonna need your help tonight.
I gotta do something I don't wanna do.

806
01:12:08,992 --> 01:12:11,036
Come on.
Tom.

807
01:12:12,746 --> 01:12:14,081
This is not The Bayside.

808
01:12:14,081 --> 01:12:16,250
This is something back in The
Richmond I gotta take care of.

809
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:17,918
What are you...

810
01:12:17,918 --> 01:12:19,878
You get <i>as</i> far
from here <i>as</i> you can.

811
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,422
You run until you hit The Bayside
and you can hang out there.

812
01:12:22,464 --> 01:12:24,132
Sure, tough QUY-

813
01:12:44,278 --> 01:12:46,864
When's this train take off? I
gotta get back to The Richmond.

814
01:12:46,905 --> 01:12:47,948
We don't.

815
01:12:47,948 --> 01:12:50,659
Look, lady, I gotta get
moving. It's important.

816
01:12:50,701 --> 01:12:53,328
Well, you ain't gonna
get there on this train.

817
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:55,622
Hey! Maybe you better think about it.

818
01:12:55,664 --> 01:12:57,749
The Bombers have gone crazy.

819
01:12:57,791 --> 01:13:01,503
They're doing everything they
can to seal off The Richmond.

820
01:13:26,403 --> 01:13:27,905
Let's go.

821
01:13:43,003 --> 01:13:45,172
What the hell
are you doing here, Clyde?

822
01:13:45,172 --> 01:13:48,091
I told everybody to get off the
streets until this thing is over with.

823
01:13:48,133 --> 01:13:50,802
Yeah, but I wanna see
Raven run from up close.

824
01:13:50,844 --> 01:13:52,512
Just stay out of the way.

825
01:13:59,728 --> 01:14:01,104
Well?

826
01:14:01,146 --> 01:14:06,151
Real simple. There's no showdown. Tom
Cody ain't here and neither is the girl.

827
01:14:07,235 --> 01:14:08,862
I don't get it.

828
01:14:10,447 --> 01:14:12,449
Get off your bike, Raven.

829
01:14:15,118 --> 01:14:17,913
I ain't too crazy
about jails, Chief.

830
01:14:19,873 --> 01:14:22,084
I got a better idea for you.

831
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:42,437
Holy shit!

832
01:14:47,901 --> 01:14:50,278
They're here! They're here!

833
01:15:09,006 --> 01:15:12,467
I told your friend Cody
I could get a lot of guns.

834
01:15:13,093 --> 01:15:15,470
Hey, get out of my way!
What the hell!

835
01:15:16,763 --> 01:15:18,849
What is this?
You can't get away with this.

836
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:21,685
You think you can ride into any
town and kidnap anybody you want?

837
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:24,938
Now, get the hell out of town
and leave these people alone.

838
01:15:52,007 --> 01:15:55,594
Sorry I'm late. I got
something special in mind.

839
01:15:56,303 --> 01:15:59,056
I brought them along
just for you.

840
01:16:03,894 --> 01:16:07,898
Well, my plan went to shit.
Let's see how you do.

841
01:16:12,110 --> 01:16:13,653
Kick his ass.

842
01:16:41,515 --> 01:16:42,849
Nice, huh?

843
01:16:54,111 --> 01:16:55,445
Get him!

844
01:17:29,437 --> 01:17:30,939
Drop him!

845
01:18:21,031 --> 01:18:22,157
Tom!

846
01:19:53,581 --> 01:19:55,500
Let's get out of here!

847
01:20:19,441 --> 01:20:24,404
No more timing

848
01:20:24,529 --> 01:20:28,074
Each tear that falls
from my eyes

849
01:20:28,742 --> 01:20:32,454
I'm not hiding

850
01:20:32,787 --> 01:20:36,708
The remedy to cure
this old heart of mine

851
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:39,627
I can dream about you

852
01:20:40,462 --> 01:20:43,715
If I can't hold you tonight

853
01:20:44,924 --> 01:20:46,885
I can dream about you

854
01:20:46,926 --> 01:20:50,096
You know something, Waldo,
we're gonna be rich.

855
01:20:50,138 --> 01:20:52,474
Yeah. Long live rock and roll.

856
01:20:53,767 --> 01:20:57,020
I can dream about you

857
01:20:57,479 --> 01:21:00,940
If I can't hold you tonight

858
01:21:02,025 --> 01:21:05,153
I can dream about you

859
01:21:05,945 --> 01:21:09,199
You know how
to hold me just right

860
01:21:11,284 --> 01:21:15,330
Moving sidewalks,

861
01:21:15,497 --> 01:21:19,167
I don't see under my feet

862
01:21:20,377 --> 01:21:24,005
Great, huh? My new discovery. I'm
gonna take them right up the ladder.

863
01:21:24,047 --> 01:21:26,841
Yeah, they ought to make you
a lot of money, Fish.

864
01:21:28,802 --> 01:21:31,554
Look, don't worry, Cody, I'm not
gonna stand in your way with Ellen.

865
01:21:31,596 --> 01:21:34,057
I know how it is
between you two.

866
01:21:34,974 --> 01:21:36,810
There's one thing
we both know, Fish.

867
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:39,145
She needs you a lot more
than she needs me.

868
01:21:39,187 --> 01:21:42,357
Yeah, she needs me,
but she loves you.

869
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:45,777
She'll get over it. She's
used to me being unreliable.

870
01:21:45,819 --> 01:21:48,321
Is that what I'm
supposed to tell her?

871
01:21:48,321 --> 01:21:52,534
You're okay with words. You'll
make her feel better than I could.

872
01:21:55,328 --> 01:21:57,247
Take it easy, Cody.

873
01:21:57,956 --> 01:21:59,332
Thanks.

874
01:21:59,624 --> 01:22:01,793
I'll take it
wherever I can get it.

875
01:22:06,506 --> 01:22:11,761
Climbing up
from the pain in my heart

876
01:22:12,053 --> 01:22:14,264
'Cause it's you that I need.

877
01:22:22,939 --> 01:22:28,486
I can dream

878
01:22:28,528 --> 01:22:34,033
Everybody!

879
01:22:39,622 --> 01:22:42,083
Yes, I can dream

880
01:22:49,048 --> 01:22:51,092
I don't understand it

881
01:22:51,134 --> 01:22:55,096
I can't keep my mind
off loving you

882
01:22:55,138 --> 01:22:57,098
Love you forever

883
01:22:57,557 --> 01:22:59,517
Ooh, now baby

884
01:22:59,559 --> 01:23:03,688
I'm caught up
in the magic I see in you

885
01:23:03,730 --> 01:23:05,648
There's one thing to do

886
01:23:05,690 --> 01:23:07,567
I can dream about you

887
01:23:07,567 --> 01:23:11,529
Guess you're just gonna cut
out, huh? Yeah. You know me.

888
01:23:11,571 --> 01:23:15,492
Yeah, I know you. You're
the guy with the right hook.

889
01:23:20,830 --> 01:23:23,750
Is that it? Is that
all you've left to say?

890
01:23:25,668 --> 01:23:29,214
Look, I know you're gonna be going
places with your singing and stuff,

891
01:23:29,255 --> 01:23:33,843
but then I'm not the kind of guy to be
carrying your guitars around for you.

892
01:23:35,428 --> 01:23:39,432
But if you ever need me
for something, I'll be there.

893
01:23:43,603 --> 01:23:47,482
I can dream about you

894
01:23:47,607 --> 01:23:52,111
I'm gonna press my lips against
you and hold you tight to me

895
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:55,114
I can dream about you

896
01:23:56,115 --> 01:24:00,662
You know you got me spellbound
what else can it be

897
01:24:00,703 --> 01:24:02,997
I can dream

898
01:24:04,332 --> 01:24:07,210
Dreamin' about you

899
01:24:43,162 --> 01:24:46,666
I've got a dream
'bout an angel on the beach

900
01:24:46,708 --> 01:24:50,128
And the perfect waves
are starting to come

901
01:24:51,838 --> 01:24:55,466
His hair is flying out
in ribbons of gold

902
01:24:55,508 --> 01:24:59,095
And his touch
has got the power to stun

903
01:25:00,179 --> 01:25:03,933
I've got a dream
'bout an angel in the forest

904
01:25:03,975 --> 01:25:07,186
Enchanted by
the edge of a lake

905
01:25:09,188 --> 01:25:12,609
His body's flowing
in the jewels alive

906
01:25:12,650 --> 01:25:16,070
And the earth below him
starting to shake

907
01:25:16,821 --> 01:25:20,408
But I don't see
any angels in the city

908
01:25:21,284 --> 01:25:24,579
I don't hear
any holy choirs sing

909
01:25:25,455 --> 01:25:27,874
And if I can't get an angel

910
01:25:27,874 --> 01:25:29,834
I can still get a boy

911
01:25:29,876 --> 01:25:33,004
And a boy'd
be the next best thing

912
01:25:33,046 --> 01:25:36,174
The next best thing
to an angel

913
01:25:36,382 --> 01:25:39,886
A boy'd be the next best thing

914
01:25:47,393 --> 01:25:50,188
I've got a dream
'bout a boy in a castle

915
01:25:50,229 --> 01:25:53,024
And he's dancing
like a cat on the stairs

916
01:25:53,858 --> 01:25:56,944
He's got the fire
of a prince in his eyes

917
01:25:56,986 --> 01:26:00,073
And the thunder
of a drum in his ears

918
01:26:00,657 --> 01:26:03,451
I've got a dream
'bout a boy on a star

919
01:26:03,493 --> 01:26:06,245
Lookin' down
upon the rim of the world

920
01:26:07,288 --> 01:26:10,166
He's there all alone and
dreamin' of someone like me

921
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:13,294
I'm not an angel
but at least I'm a girl

922
01:26:14,128 --> 01:26:16,964
I've got a dream
when the darkness is over

923
01:26:17,006 --> 01:26:19,926
We'll be lyin'
in the rays of the sun

924
01:26:20,343 --> 01:26:23,721
But it's only a dream
and tonight is for real

925
01:26:23,763 --> 01:26:25,431
You'll never know
what it means

926
01:26:25,473 --> 01:26:27,392
But you'll know how it feels

927
01:26:27,433 --> 01:26:30,269
It's gonna be over, over

928
01:26:30,269 --> 01:26:32,980
Before you know it's begun

929
01:26:33,022 --> 01:26:35,692
It's all we really got tonight

930
01:26:35,733 --> 01:26:37,276
Stop your cryin' hold on

931
01:26:37,276 --> 01:26:38,486
Tonight

932
01:26:38,778 --> 01:26:40,738
Before you know it it's gone

933
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:41,989
Tonight

934
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:48,538
Tonight is what
it means to be young

935
01:26:48,579 --> 01:26:50,790
Let the fire be started

936
01:26:50,790 --> 01:26:54,168
We're dancing for the restless
and the broken-hearted

937
01:26:54,210 --> 01:26:55,920
Let the rebels begin

938
01:26:55,962 --> 01:26:57,588
Let the fire be started

939
01:26:57,630 --> 01:27:00,925
We're dancing for the
desperate and the broken-hearted

940
01:27:00,967 --> 01:27:02,552
Let the rebels begin

941
01:27:02,593 --> 01:27:05,638
Tonight is what
it means to be young

942
01:27:06,514 --> 01:27:08,808
Before you know it it's gone

943
01:27:08,808 --> 01:27:12,729
Say a prayer in the darkness
for the magic to come

944
01:27:14,814 --> 01:27:16,149
No matter what it seems

945
01:27:16,190 --> 01:27:22,947
Tonight is what
it means to be young

946
01:27:23,740 --> 01:27:26,033
Before you know it's begun

947
01:27:26,701 --> 01:27:29,704
Tonight is what
it means to be young

948
01:27:30,288 --> 01:27:32,665
Before you know it's begun

949
01:27:59,150 --> 01:28:01,694
I've got a dream
when the darkness is over

950
01:28:01,736 --> 01:28:04,739
We'll be lyin'
in the rays of the sun

951
01:28:05,031 --> 01:28:08,075
But it's only a dream
and tonight is for real

952
01:28:08,117 --> 01:28:09,952
You'll never know
what it means

953
01:28:09,994 --> 01:28:11,788
But you'll know how it feels

954
01:28:11,829 --> 01:28:13,581
It's gonna be over, over

955
01:28:13,956 --> 01:28:17,126
Before you know it's begun

956
01:28:17,126 --> 01:28:20,254
It's all we really got tonight

957
01:28:20,296 --> 01:28:21,881
Stop your cryin' hold on

958
01:28:21,923 --> 01:28:23,257
Tonight

959
01:28:23,299 --> 01:28:25,259
Before you know it it's gone

960
01:28:25,301 --> 01:28:26,511
Tonight

961
01:28:26,928 --> 01:28:32,558
Tonight is what
it means to be young

962
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:33,976
Let the rebels begin

963
01:28:34,018 --> 01:28:35,311
Let the fire be started

964
01:28:35,353 --> 01:28:39,273
We're dancing for the restless
and the broken-hearted

965
01:28:39,315 --> 01:28:40,608
Let the rebels begin

966
01:28:40,650 --> 01:28:41,859
Let the fire be started

967
01:28:41,901 --> 01:28:44,779
Tonight is what
it means to be young

968
01:28:44,821 --> 01:28:46,823
Before you know it it's gone

969
01:28:46,864 --> 01:28:50,743
Say a prayer in the darkness
for the magic to come

970
01:28:52,078 --> 01:28:54,080
No matter what it seems

971
01:28:54,121 --> 01:28:57,375
Tonight is what
it means to be young

972
01:29:03,339 --> 01:29:05,466
Hey, Cody, how do you
like my new wheels?

973
01:29:05,508 --> 01:29:07,593
I found it
in the middle of the street.

974
01:29:07,593 --> 01:29:10,972
Somebody just dumped it. Finders
keepers, you know what I mean?

975
01:29:11,013 --> 01:29:13,558
Maybe you need
some company, huh?

976
01:29:13,599 --> 01:29:16,143
Yeah, I don't mind
if you tag along.

977
01:29:20,273 --> 01:29:22,441
I guess this is
my big chance, huh?

978
01:29:25,278 --> 01:29:28,948
Hey, cool down, big guy, I already
told you, you're not my type.
