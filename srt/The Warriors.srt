1
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:28,547
It's still on, and we're going.

2
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:32,342
Cyrus sent an emissary this afternoon
to make sure.

3
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,469
Now, Cyrus don't want anybody packed.

4
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,264
He don't want anybody
flexing any muscle.

5
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:40,517
I gave him my word that the Warriors
would uphold the truce.

6
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,480
Everybody says that Cyrus
is the one and only.

7
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,777
I think we'd better
go have a look for ourself.

8
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:36,198
- We ain't been to the Bronx before.
- No sweat.

9
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:38,325
This conclave's gonna be
a real big item.

10
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,702
Every gang in the city is gonna be there.

11
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,966
We're going in there with nothing.

12
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,385
We're going in there
like everybody else.

13
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,137
Nine guys, ho weapons.

14
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,554
You got the stuff?

15
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,015
I want you to hit everything in sight.

16
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,434
I want everybody to know
the Warriors were there.

17
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,888
You never know what
you're gonna run into out there.

18
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,682
- Wearing our colors, we can't hide.
- Who wants to hide?

19
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,179
Maybe we'll get to waste a few heads
along the way.

20
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,473
You just soldier
and keep your mouth shut.

21
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,859
When we get there,
you stick close by, okay?

22
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,777
Don't worry.
I don't feel like getting wrecked.

23
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:05,866
One thing we might get
out of Cyrus' little get-together

24
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,909
Is meeting some strange wool.

25
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,537
I wouldn't mind laying something down
on the way back.

26
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,664
You got a one-track brain,
you know that?

27
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,165
What's the matter?
You going faggot?

28
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,793
What do you know about Cyrus?

29
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,712
Magic.

30
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,214
A whole lot of magic.

31
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:25,719
- What do you know about Cyrus?
- He's the one and only.

32
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,763
When you're president
of the biggest gang in the city,

33
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,849
you don't have to take any shit.

34
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,058
Fuck him.

35
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,198
I'll tell you something,
I'll bet nobody's even gonna be there.

36
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,910
Can you count, suckers?

37
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:20,125
I say the future is ours

38
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,838
if you can count!

39
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:34,014
- Come on, Cyrus, we're with you!
- Go ahead, bro!

40
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,730
Now, look what we have here before us.

41
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,858
We've got the Saracens

42
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,110
sitting next to the Jones Street Boys.

43
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,697
We've got the Moon Runners

44
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,491
right by the Van Courtland Rangers.

45
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:58,038
Nobody is wasting nobody.

46
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,123
That

47
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,751
is a miracle.

48
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,879
And miracles

49
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,381
Is the way things ought to be.

50
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,258
- Yeah!
- I heard that!

51
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,930
- I heard that.
- Come get answered!

52
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:23,855
You're standing right now
with nine delegates from 100 gangs.

53
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,942
And there's over 100 more.

54
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:32,197
That's 20,000 hard-core members.

55
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,909
Forty thousand, counting affiliates,

56
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:39,496
and 20,000 more,
not organized but ready to fight.

57
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,667
Sixty thousand soldiers.

58
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:51,216
Now, there ain't but
20,000 police in the whole town.

59
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:55,887
Can you dig it?

60
00:09:55,887 --> 00:10:00,183
- Can you dig it?
- Yeah!

61
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,199
Now here's the sum total.

62
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,578
One gang could run this city.

63
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,248
One gang.

64
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,794
Nothing would move
without us allowing it to happen.

65
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,214
We could tax the crime syndicates,

66
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,757
the police,

67
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:35,927
because we got the streets, suckers!

68
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:40,807
- Can you dig it?
- Yeah!

69
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,450
Right on!

70
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,836
The problem in the past

71
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,672
has been the man
turning us against one another.

72
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,717
We have been unable to see the truth,

73
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:20,638
because we've been fighting
for 10 square feet of ground,

74
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:24,976
our turf, our little piece of turf.

75
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,062
That's crap, brothers.

76
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,566
The turf is ours by right

77
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,443
because it's our turn.

78
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,239
All we have to do

79
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,074
is keep up the general truce.

80
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:44,245
We take over one borough at a time.

81
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:48,124
Secure our territory.

82
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,961
Secure our turf.

83
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:57,592
Because it's all our turf.

84
00:11:57,592 --> 00:12:01,679
Yeah!

85
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,029
The other way, against the crowd!

86
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,864
And keep your ass down!

87
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:44,324
Down!

88
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:51,789
Get out of the way.

89
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,097
- They'll kill us all.
- Watch out, man. Watch his head.

90
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,685
There wasn't supposed to be no guns!

91
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:17,815
Come on, move it!

92
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,442
- Is Cleon all right?
- I think he's up there.

93
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:20,902
- Are you sure?
- No.

94
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,528
Come on! Move it!

95
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,869
There he is! That's him!

96
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,871
That's the Warrior!

97
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:36,417
- He shot Cyrus!
- Man, you're crazy. I didn't do nothing.

98
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,212
- We saw him!
- Yeah, that's him.

99
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:43,091
He's the one. He's the one!
The Warriors did it!

100
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:46,177
The Warriors did it! The Warriors did it!

101
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,346
The Warriors did it!

102
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,234
Kill him!

103
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,381
Down. Everybody down!

104
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,883
- Shit!
- You all right?

105
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,134
Yeah.

106
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,646
Everybody quiet.

107
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,297
Everybody make it?

108
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,009
Just Cleon's missing.

109
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,512
- Fuzz must've got him.
- Did you see him get busted?

110
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,847
I seen him,
then he wasn't there no more.

111
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,349
I was hauling ass.

112
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,476
Why don't you look around,
make sure we're okay.

113
00:16:58,476 --> 00:16:59,936
This is a graveyard.

114
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,025
Okay, what are we gonna do now?

115
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,779
We're going back.

116
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:12,532
You mind telling us how?

117
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,493
Fucking Coney Island
must be 50 to 100 miles from here.

118
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:18,579
- It's the only choice we got.
- Yeah, real simple.

119
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,791
Except that every cop in the city
is looking to bust our heads.

120
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,335
- We got something else to think about.
- Yeah? What?

121
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,212
The truce.

122
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,381
Is it still on?

123
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,175
If it ain't, we're gonna have to bop
our way back.

124
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,012
Shit, I wish we was packed.

125
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:46,148
If this truce is off, anything could
hit us between here and that train.

126
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,025
If you get separated,

127
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,486
make it to the platform at Union Square.

128
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,614
- That's where we change trains.
- I only got one question.

129
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,413
Who named you leader?

130
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,960
I got as much right to take over as you.

131
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,254
It was Cleon's choice. Swan's war chief.

132
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:12,592
Right about now, Cleon's most likely got
a nightstick shoved halfway up his ass.

133
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,762
Shit.
I bet you can't even find the subway.

134
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,100
Maybe we ought to talk about this
later, huh?

135
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,603
Well, what's wrong with right now?

136
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,271
I wanna be warlord.

137
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,941
Make your move.

138
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:32,445
- Hey, Ajax, lighten up.
- Big boy, Swan's war chief.

139
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,656
We better stick together.

140
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,662
Hey, you guys!
The train's right over there.

141
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,914
Come on. Hurry up. Let's go!

142
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,460
Let's move.

143
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,840
Hey, man, don't worry about it.
Stay loose.

144
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,300
Fuck.

145
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,303
Rembrandt, mark this spot.

146
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:16,030
Hey! Wait for me!

147
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:00,950
Riffs!

148
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,077
Yeah, right!

149
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:18,217
Who are the Warriors?

150
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,899
There must be some word.

151
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,865
I want them all.

152
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,576
I want all the Warriors!

153
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,370
I want them alive, if possible.
If not, wasted.

154
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,206
But I want them.

155
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:01,594
Send the word.

156
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:10,019
All right, now, for all you boppers
out there in the big city,

157
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,897
all you street people
with an ear for the action,

158
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:17,193
I've been asked to relay a request
from the Gramercy Riffs.

159
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,236
It's a special for the Warriors.

160
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:22,156
That's that real, live bunch from Coney.

161
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:25,367
And I do mean the Warriors.

162
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,495
Here's a hit with them in mind.

163
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,179
Be looking good, Warriors.

164
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:52,222
All the way back to Coney.

165
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,433
You hear me, babies?

166
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,394
Good. Real good.

167
00:23:58,604 --> 00:23:59,897
Adios.

168
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:14,662
- Come on. What kind of crap is this?
- Yeah. What are we waiting for?

169
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:16,038
A train would help,

170
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:18,916
unless you wanna go up there
and get japped on an open platform.

171
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,960
Bullshit, man.
There ain't nobody on the street.

172
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,295
He's right. We're acting like faggots.

173
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,886
Just keep talking.

174
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:47,319
Move.

175
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,330
That's the Turnbull A.C.'s.

176
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:02,334
I think they forgot about the truce.

177
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,544
No shit.

178
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,673
Those lousy skinheaded fucks.

179
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,525
That's our train. We gotta make it.

180
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,574
Oh, Jesus Christ!

181
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,542
Are we gonna go for it?

182
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:38,639
Hold the fucking train!

183
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,184
Those guys were
some desperate dudes.

184
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:27,646
- So was we!
- In an even fight we could take them.

185
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,274
Bunch of chicken shits!

186
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:32,651
Those cats didn't look
too chicken shit to me.

187
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,153
Me, neither.

188
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:40,409
Well, we made it.
And in an hour, it is C.l., the Big Coney.

189
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:43,203
You got it. Give me that fist, buddy.

190
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,873
When we get there,
that's when we've made it.

191
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:51,420
Hey, no sweat, war chief.

192
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,673
- Hey! I've got Coney Island!
- Yeah!

193
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,092
Figure out how many stops
to the Union Square?

194
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,928
Hey, come on, man.
That's high math for Rembrandt.

195
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,557
It's all right.
Nobody can read these maps anyway.

196
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:06,560
Hey, forget it. What's the difference?
We're home free.

197
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,193
We just heard from the Turnbulls.

198
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,236
They blew it.

199
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,299
Shit. This train's had it.

200
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,843
This is fucking impossible.

201
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,596
What the shit are we gonna do?
This sucks.

202
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:44,348
Why couldn't it rain now?

203
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:47,434
Maybe we ought to worry about
who set that goddamn fire.

204
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,561
Come on.

205
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:19,758
Yeah.

206
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,385
How are you?

207
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:22,928
I was just checking in.

208
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:26,807
Yeah, it was a real mess up there.

209
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:30,686
This guy, Cyrus, had an accident.

210
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,314
They did?

211
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,734
Well, that's okay.

212
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,988
These guys, the Warriors.

213
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:44,241
Yeah, they deserve it.

214
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,493
Yeah, we will.

215
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,288
Take care of yourself.

216
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:56,003
- We set?
- We're set, all right.

217
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:58,380
Somebody should pick their ass up.

218
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:02,217
The Riffs sent out the word.
They want them alive. We don't.

219
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,303
The sooner someone grabs them,
the better.

220
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:05,470
What's the matter?

221
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,849
You afraid the Warriors gonna shoot
their mouths off before they get racked?

222
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,309
Yeah. Right. I'm worried.

223
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:12,769
- I just don't want the Riffs on my ass.
- No sweat.

224
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,856
They're looking for the Warriors,
remember?

225
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,068
We can do some looking, too.

226
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,030
Ought to make you feel better.

227
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,950
Hey.

228
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:30,370
- What about the money you owe?
- For what?

229
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:47,846
We've had it.

230
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,558
Yeah, I made them.

231
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,143
Two there, one there.

232
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:54,853
I think they just made us.

233
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:57,814
You recognize them?

234
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,107
Orphans.

235
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,526
So far down, they ain't even on the map.

236
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,278
Real low-class.

237
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,531
- Numbers?
- Full strength, maybe 30.

238
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,116
Thirty's a lot more than eight.

239
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:11,244
Not if they're wimps.
And I'm sick of this running crap.

240
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,459
Come on. This way.

241
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,656
Hey.

242
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:51,827
- You know where that cat's headed.
- Yeah. Reinforcements.

243
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:54,621
We're gonna get japped here.
We're gonna get japped.

244
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,422
No matter what he says, nobody lip-off.

245
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:07,134
Nobody get hot.
I'm gonna see what I can do.

246
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:09,928
- When did you turn into a diplomat?
- Yeah.

247
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,806
You ain't exactly
the State Department type.

248
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,391
Fox, you come with me.

249
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:27,487
- You ought to show me your invitation.
- How do you figure?

250
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:33,452
Well, you come armying down here,
invading our territory.

251
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:36,371
No permits, no parley.

252
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:39,458
We're not invading.
And I'm parleying right now.

253
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,835
We were just at that big meeting
up in the Bronx.

254
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:43,295
We're going home to Coney.

255
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:46,840
The train gets messed up by the fire
and dumps us here.

256
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,260
I don't know
what you're talking about, man.

257
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,013
How could this be a big meeting
if the Orphans wasn't there?

258
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,848
You didn't miss anything.
There was a lot of hassle.

259
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:56,099
A lot of heads got busted.

260
00:32:56,099 --> 00:33:00,228
You think the Orphans ain't with it?
You think we ain't well-known?

261
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:03,023
- We didn't say that.
- Well, we got a heavy rep.

262
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:05,150
You mess with us,
and you'll find that out.

263
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,869
You see that?

264
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:20,540
They write about our raids In the paper.

265
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,125
Yeah.

266
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,712
That's really heavy.

267
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,422
The Orphans, right?

268
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,884
Yeah, our youth worker,
she talks about you guys all the time.

269
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:32,511
We ain't got one.

270
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:37,516
That must be because you guys
are so bad, they're afraid of you.

271
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:48,944
There's nothing wrong with you
making it through our territory,

272
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:50,904
as long as you're coming in peace.

273
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:06,002
Cut it, Mercy.

274
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:11,091
You know what that is, don't you?

275
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:12,801
Yeah.

276
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,052
Trouble.

277
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:23,770
Those vests are real nice.

278
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:26,648
Lighten up, Mercy.
Stop looking for trouble now.

279
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:28,650
I should've slapped your mouth
the minute you opened it.

280
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,110
So who stopped you?

281
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,908
Come on. Give me one.

282
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:40,579
Just one.

283
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:45,000
I just want one vest.
You can get another one, man.

284
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,086
No chance.

285
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:57,596
Are you just gonna let an army walk
through here any time they feel like it?

286
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:00,307
- How's it gonna look?
- Get lost.

287
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:04,269
You know, pretty soon,
every gang is just gonna boogie right in,

288
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:05,979
soldier right through.

289
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,816
I'll tell you, some man you are.

290
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,534
Take your colors off,
you can walk through.

291
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:25,832
- We don't do that.
- It's just our mark. It don't mean war.

292
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,167
You go as civilians, okay?

293
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:29,419
Go as soldiers,
I gotta come down on you.

294
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:31,129
Now take off your colors.

295
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,050
You hear me?

296
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,015
Fuck you.

297
00:35:56,613 --> 00:36:00,659
We're not gonna hide who we are just
because some whore shakes her ass.

298
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,285
Don't call me no whore.

299
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,704
I ain't no whore!

300
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:07,874
Let's go.

301
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:22,305
We're marching to the next station
through these lame fucks' territory.

302
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,848
Now let's move.

303
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:28,520
Yeah. That's right, Warriors.

304
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,605
Just keep walking.

305
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,525
Real tough mothers, ain't you?

306
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:36,111
You guys don't show me much.

307
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:39,572
Why don't you dickheads just walk
all the way back home?

308
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:47,831
- Boy, that chick's got some mouth.
- You two were really terrific back there.

309
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:52,085
- You guys let them down, but good.
- His ass gonna be ringing for a month.

310
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:55,505
- I say we should have wasted them.
- Come on. The station's this way.

311
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,629
Let me go! Let me be.

312
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,265
Okay, what do you got in mind?

313
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,937
Well, maybe I'm looking for
some real action.

314
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:36,523
Hey, what about me? I got the big one.

315
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:40,527
I'll give it to you, baby.

316
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:41,820
Let her go.

317
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,909
You gonna jump me?

318
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:53,373
Maybe we ought to pull a train on you.
You look like you might even like it.

319
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:56,125
- Fuck you!
- Real tough chick.

320
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,934
You see what you get, Warriors?

321
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:15,854
You see what you get
when you mess with the Orphans?

322
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:27,115
We're gonna rain on you, Warriors!

323
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,626
- Holy shit!
- Now!

324
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:55,643
- Move, move!
- Where is everybody?

325
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,020
Come on!

326
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:26,257
Hey, wait a minute.
I gotta ask a question.

327
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,676
How come we're running?

328
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:33,431
I told you, they're a bunch of wimps.

329
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,850
Union Station, here we come.

330
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,560
Hey, what about me?

331
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,360
So, what about you?

332
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,667
We got a report from the Bronx.

333
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:03,461
Some smalltime clique ran into them.

334
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,963
The Orphans.

335
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:07,924
- They're not in our network.
- They rumble anyway.

336
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:11,010
They got wasted.

337
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,605
Okay, let's get down to it, boppers.

338
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,816
We're gonna have to do better
out there.

339
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:28,736
Our friends just made it past
one of the minor league teams.

340
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,697
Remember, boppers,

341
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:32,156
be looking good.

342
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,910
All that's going on?

343
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:40,039
Right. Great.

344
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:41,958
Great.

345
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,293
Yeah.

346
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,260
Well?

347
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,513
Some two-bit outfit almost got them,
but they bopped their way past.

348
00:41:55,513 --> 00:42:00,226
- We can meet them at 96th Street.
- The platform's crawling with cops.

349
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:03,563
Cops are trying to rack up every gang
in this town.

350
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:07,442
- Me and you included.
- How come you're so happy about this?

351
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,528
I'm having a good time.

352
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,781
- Let's go!
- All right!

353
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:34,969
How much longer we gotta wait?
We might be here forever.

354
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,638
I'm sick of waiting for trains.

355
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:40,850
Vermin, sit down and shut up.

356
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,351
Okay, okay.

357
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:24,268
- Let's go!
- Where are we going?

358
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,274
Hey, hold it!

359
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,902
- Right there.
- Come on.

360
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,780
- Hold it.
- Hey.

361
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,495
Take the uptown.

362
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:44,539
- Make it! Make it!
- Move!

363
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:47,583
- Hey! Move! Move!
- Wait up!

364
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:50,962
- Come back here!
- Hold it!

365
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,598
Let's double back!

366
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:05,685
- This way!
- No. Come on. Over here.

367
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:07,395
That way! Go!

368
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,982
- Down the stairs!
- Hurry up.

369
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,655
- The street!
- Far enough, already.

370
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:22,827
This way.

371
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,163
Oh, shit!

372
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:27,957
Run!

373
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:29,959
Just get out of here!

374
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:31,377
Move!

375
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,506
- God damn you!
- Let go of me!

376
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:53,107
- Union Square! Union Square!
- What about the others?

377
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,609
We gotta go!

378
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:56,569
Keep after them! Keep on!

379
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:33,397
Maybe we'd better take off.

380
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,566
Yeah. Right.

381
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:04,845
- Did we lose these fucking clowns?
- Look.

382
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,473
Holy shit!

383
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,664
Snow, with me!

384
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:49,533
Hey!

385
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,720
I can't make it.

386
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,306
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

387
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,684
Good.
I'm sick of running from these wimps.

388
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:37,331
I'm gonna shove that bat up your ass
and turn you into a Popsicle.

389
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,416
Come on.

390
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,226
- Fucking-A.
- Hey!

391
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,410
Come on, Cowboy.

392
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:07,922
Shit, I figured they were wimps.

393
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:15,304
The latest sports news
off the street, boppers.

394
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:19,058
The Baseball Furies dropped the ball,
made an error.

395
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:23,646
Our friends are on second base and
trying to make it all the way home.

396
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:27,358
But the inside word is
that the odds are against them.

397
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:29,902
Stay tuned, boppers.

398
00:50:29,902 --> 00:50:31,320
Stay tuned.

399
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:58,430
- Where is everybody?
- Looks like we're the first ones here.

400
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:01,392
We're just gonna have to sit and wait.

401
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:03,435
They'll show up.

402
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:06,605
Looks like something else showed up.

403
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:08,440
Well, hey, hey, hey.

404
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,777
Now look at what you find here
in the big city.

405
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:14,613
- Hey, you guys. We ain't got time.
- Are you kidding?

406
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:16,991
Time's what we got plenty of.

407
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:30,212
Hi.

408
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:47,313
Hey.

409
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:06,999
Hey.

410
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:14,506
Hey.

411
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:20,012
I guess she don't know
that parks ain't safe after dark.

412
00:52:20,012 --> 00:52:21,972
We ain't got time for this right now.

413
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:25,142
We've got to get to Union Square.

414
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:28,937
You go ahead if you want.
I'm gonna get a little exercise.

415
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:30,981
You never were very smart.

416
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:34,860
I'll tell you something, warlord.

417
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,695
I'm smart enough.

418
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,739
And it's there for free.

419
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:40,240
You two coming?

420
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:44,870
- Come on, man.
- There's plenty of women back home.

421
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,333
Maybe all of you just going faggot.

422
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,394
You feeling all right, lady?

423
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:10,938
You need a little help or something?

424
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:13,607
Why don't you sit down?
Keep me company.

425
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,780
Whatever you say, lady.

426
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:24,535
Look at those muscles.

427
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:27,204
I bet the chicks like all those muscles.

428
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:38,632
Hey.

429
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:43,512
We better go back and look out for him.

430
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:47,891
He saved my ass back there.

431
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,184
I owe him.

432
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:52,688
Okay, I'll go look for the others.

433
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:06,577
You wanna show me
how you play with the chicks?

434
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:09,788
Yeah.

435
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:14,501
- I'll show you how I play.
- Hey!

436
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,920
Not so rough. Come on.

437
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,674
- We'll get it on.
- You don't get it. I like it rough.

438
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,939
Your nights in the park
are over for a while, honey.

439
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:38,275
- You're under arrest.
- Hey, lady.

440
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,735
Come on, lady.

441
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:42,029
Kiss my ass.

442
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,200
Come on, lady.

443
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:53,707
Come on. Quit playing around.
You don't wanna play around with me!

444
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,630
Let me out of this thing!

445
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:00,839
You hear me?

446
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:09,056
God damn it! Let me go!

447
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,478
Let me go!

448
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:19,441
You can't do this to me!
Come on, you lousy bitch!

449
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:47,177
Fucking wimp.

450
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,182
Hey, wait!

451
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:40,731
There's still cops all over the place.

452
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:45,027
Where's the Fox?

453
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:46,653
A cop grabbed him.

454
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:50,282
So how come you hung around?

455
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,286
Don't know.

456
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:58,999
- Where did you get the coat?
- You ask a lot of questions.

457
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:00,709
Don't give me that.

458
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:05,255
I stole it.

459
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:08,926
Cops are looking for
somebody in a pink top.

460
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:11,178
Real tough chick.

461
00:57:11,178 --> 00:57:13,263
Right. You said that before.

462
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:20,520
If you still wanna get to Union Square,
I can show you where to grab the train.

463
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,230
Okay.

464
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,523
Come on.

465
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:27,903
Hey.

466
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:18,912
Hey!

467
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,509
- What is that?
- Hold it!

468
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,511
- Freeze!
- Go on.

469
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,846
Move it!

470
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:37,681
- Jesus!
- Come on!

471
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:39,141
Run!

472
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:00,495
Is this the place?

473
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:06,126
Hey, I hate asking the questions,
but where's the dudes?

474
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:08,336
Chicks like you
always got dudes around.

475
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:11,339
They took the night off.
Went up to the Bronx.

476
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:13,258
Don't worry about them.

477
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:16,053
They're lame, real cripples.

478
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:27,898
Come on.

479
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:34,237
When I got off that subway
and I saw you, I thought,

480
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:36,156
"Oh, baby, throw it my way."

481
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:38,867
I mean, it's really great of you chicks
taking us in like this.

482
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:41,203
We know about the Warriors.
You're a heavy outfit.

483
00:59:41,203 --> 00:59:43,038
Sure, we know you about you guys.

484
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:46,166
- How'd you hear about us?
- You know how it is. Word gets around.

485
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:51,296
- I guess we are pretty well-known.
- Come on.

486
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:25,413
You know, you're the first friendly faces
we've seen all night.

487
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:26,957
That's the way we are.

488
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:29,543
Let's party a little. Get something going.

489
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:34,131
- Yeah, sure. Hey, I can dig that.
- Hey, you came to the right guys.

490
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,218
Oh, hurt me, hurt me.

491
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:41,847
Don't thank us, man. Just relax.

492
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:43,723
Fall out.

493
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,350
Take your pick.

494
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:56,486
Thanks. This is a great outfit.

495
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:59,114
- What clique is this?
- We're the Lizzies.

496
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,617
Lizzies. Hey, great.

497
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:05,120
Just great. I like that. I like it.

498
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,705
Glad to hear it.

499
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:13,420
Man, we got to come
to this part of town more often.

500
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:14,963
Yeah, right.

501
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:19,801
That's right. Got to.

502
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:25,307
Thanks a lot.

503
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:32,272
- Looks like you're the winner.
- Yeah, right.

504
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:45,160
How much longer
are we gonna hang around here?

505
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:49,080
- What's your hurry? We just got here.
- We ought to get to Union Square.

506
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:52,792
- They're gonna be worried about us.
- Yeah, sure. In a minute.

507
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:54,753
A little break in the action.

508
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:24,366
Can we stop for a minute?

509
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:27,953
I'm sick of this crap.
My legs are getting tired.

510
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:31,164
- Come on. Just keep walking.
- Well, what's your hurry?

511
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:34,209
Trying to set some kind of
a world record or something?

512
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:40,966
Hey.

513
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:49,516
- Just walk.
- I'm walking.

514
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:52,269
Jesus, why don't you give me a break?

515
01:02:53,937 --> 01:02:57,399
Be a little friendly.
I don't even know your name.

516
01:02:57,399 --> 01:02:58,900
My name"s Swan.

517
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:02,904
What do you care about names
so much for?

518
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:06,157
I like telling my friends
I been with somebody particular.

519
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:08,034
You know what I mean?

520
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:11,037
Why don't you just tie a mattress
to your back?

521
01:03:11,997 --> 01:03:15,000
You don't care where it is, do you?

522
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,212
Look, what do you got against me?
You've been picking on me all night.

523
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:21,423
You want me to tell you the truth?

524
01:03:21,423 --> 01:03:23,216
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

525
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:25,135
I don't like the way you live.

526
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:28,346
- The way I live?
- Yeah.

527
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:31,850
I keep hoping I'm gonna
run into something a little better.

528
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:34,561
What kind of crap is this?

529
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:36,771
Who are you?
You ain't any better than me.

530
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:39,149
I guess you like the way
everything's going for you.

531
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:40,942
Well, maybe I do.

532
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:44,362
Friday nights are pretty good.
Saturday nights are better.

533
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:47,782
I don't think you can remember who
you get on Friday and Saturday night.

534
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:50,118
I don't think you can remember
what they look like.

535
01:03:50,118 --> 01:03:53,204
Sometimes I can,
and sometimes I can't.

536
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:54,748
Who gives a damn?

537
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:59,753
I see what's happening next door
and down the block,

538
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:02,756
belly hanging down, five kids,

539
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:04,549
cockroaches in the cupboard.

540
01:04:06,468 --> 01:04:08,470
I'll tell you what I want.

541
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:11,181
I want something now.

542
01:04:12,057 --> 01:04:15,268
This is the life I got left.
You know what I mean?

543
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:18,646
You get it, Warrior?

544
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:21,775
Get it?

545
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,835
How do you like it?

546
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:26,965
Come on. What's wrong?

547
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:29,801
Let's just get to the next station, okay?

548
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,303
No.

549
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:34,013
Please?

550
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:37,308
Come on.

551
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:43,356
You're just part of everything that's
happening tonight, and it's all bad.

552
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:50,280
Just go back
to wherever it was you came from.

553
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:39,579
Hey, little man, you wanna dance?

554
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:19,452
I'll be right with you, babe.

555
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:37,720
So you're the famous Warriors,
the guys that shot Cyrus.

556
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,640
Shit! The chicks are packed.
The chicks are packed!

557
01:07:41,516 --> 01:07:42,600
Shit!

558
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:11,838
Shit.

559
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:27,812
She cut me. She cut me.

560
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:30,273
Look. Look, man.

561
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:33,943
Now we gotta hold ourselves together.
We got to.

562
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:38,406
See, man, now if we go to pieces,
somebody out there's gonna get us.

563
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:40,950
They think we shot Cyrus.

564
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:42,744
What are you talking about?
I don't get it.

565
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:44,495
They think we shot Cyrus.

566
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:47,206
Every gang in this city
must be looking for us.

567
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:48,499
Holy shit!

568
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:52,629
We're not gonna be able
to make it back.

569
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:54,297
We're gonna make it back.

570
01:08:54,297 --> 01:08:57,050
We came this far.
We'll go the rest of the way.

571
01:08:57,050 --> 01:09:00,261
Let's go to Union Square, okay?
We gotta tell the rest of the guys.

572
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:21,194
Hey.

573
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:24,405
Where's the rest of them?

574
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:27,992
Yeah, right.

575
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:37,543
Where's everybody else?

576
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:41,464
Cops got Ajax.
We don't know about Swan.

577
01:11:41,464 --> 01:11:45,384
- Oh, Jesus!
- Are you sure about Ajax?

578
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:46,928
Real sure.

579
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:51,057
I bet he went out swinging.

580
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:53,142
We better go look for Swan.

581
01:11:55,937 --> 01:11:58,523
God, I can't believe it.

582
01:11:58,523 --> 01:12:00,525
Yeah. What is this shit?

583
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:27,260
I need to talk to you.

584
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:31,305
See that dude over there
with the skates?

585
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:34,976
Over there.

586
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:38,771
He's after you.
And he's got some guys with him.

587
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:43,818
I know they're on my ass.

588
01:12:48,948 --> 01:12:51,117
But now they know I know it.

589
01:12:52,493 --> 01:12:54,620
Well, what are you gonna do?

590
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:31,407
Come on.

591
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:34,535
You sure change your mind fast.

592
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:38,289
- I was kind of rough on you back there.
- Listen, I can take care of myself.

593
01:13:38,289 --> 01:13:39,957
Sure. Come on.

594
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:51,302
Wait a minute. I can't go in there.

595
01:13:51,302 --> 01:13:52,929
It's a men's room.

596
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:55,598
Are you kidding?

597
01:15:45,249 --> 01:15:46,500
Get him!

598
01:17:21,095 --> 01:17:24,265
- What about our patrols?
- So far, nothing.

599
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:29,311
But we've got somebody here
you ought to talk to.

600
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:31,480
He says he saw who shot Cyrus.

601
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:54,670
Big Cyrus, he was gonna
run the whole city.

602
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:57,339
What crap that was.

603
01:17:57,339 --> 01:18:00,467
Cyrus was right about one thing.

604
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:03,262
It's all out there.

605
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:06,515
All we gotta do is just
figure out a way to go steal it.

606
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:07,892
Sounds great.

607
01:18:08,058 --> 01:18:11,353
All you gotta do is figure out
what's worth stealing.

608
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:38,964
Okay, come on. Let's go.

609
01:18:41,258 --> 01:18:44,345
Come on, let me get some breakfast
or something.

610
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:54,623
- Let's get off here.
- Yeah.

611
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,043
What's this for?

612
01:21:22,211 --> 01:21:24,880
I just hate seeing anything go to waste.

613
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:38,644
This is what we fought all night
to get back to?

614
01:21:41,647 --> 01:21:43,607
Maybe I'll just take off.

615
01:21:45,109 --> 01:21:47,611
Well, you know I like traveling, too.

616
01:21:48,695 --> 01:21:50,656
Where have you ever been?

617
01:21:52,032 --> 01:21:53,909
I never been anywhere.

618
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:55,994
I just know I'd like it.

619
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:01,291
Come on. Let's go.

620
01:22:41,248 --> 01:22:44,084
Stay right on their ass.

621
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:06,231
Wait a couple seconds after we move,
then cut out the other way.

622
01:23:06,231 --> 01:23:09,026
- Why can't I stay with you?
- Just do what I tell you.

623
01:23:09,026 --> 01:23:11,403
- Okay?
- Come on.

624
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:13,906
I can take care of myself.

625
01:23:14,072 --> 01:23:15,532
I proved that.

626
01:23:17,618 --> 01:23:18,827
Come on.

627
01:24:15,425 --> 01:24:17,636
Warriors.

628
01:24:17,636 --> 01:24:22,015
Come out to play.

629
01:24:22,015 --> 01:24:25,102
Warriors.

630
01:24:25,102 --> 01:24:29,606
Come out to play.

631
01:24:30,649 --> 01:24:32,693
Warriors.

632
01:24:32,693 --> 01:24:37,281
Come out to play.

633
01:24:37,281 --> 01:24:39,324
Warriors.

634
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:43,829
Come out to play.

635
01:24:43,829 --> 01:24:45,664
Warriors.

636
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:49,835
Come out to play!

637
01:24:52,379 --> 01:24:54,006
Everybody packed?

638
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:56,758
Yeah.

639
01:24:58,302 --> 01:25:02,681
All of you stay behind me.
I'm gonna take them out to the sand.

640
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:04,683
What about you? You ready?

641
01:25:09,354 --> 01:25:10,689
Let's do it.

642
01:26:18,256 --> 01:26:22,469
When we see the ocean,
we figure we're home, we're safe.

643
01:26:23,345 --> 01:26:25,430
This time, you got it wrong.

644
01:26:29,267 --> 01:26:31,395
Why did you do it?

645
01:26:31,395 --> 01:26:33,772
Why did you waste Cyrus?

646
01:26:33,772 --> 01:26:35,065
No reason.

647
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:39,528
I just like doing things like that.

648
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:49,371
Let's do it, me and you.

649
01:26:49,371 --> 01:26:51,748
One on one?

650
01:26:51,748 --> 01:26:53,166
You're crazy.

651
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:59,005
You're dead.

652
01:26:59,005 --> 01:27:01,675
All of you, and you know it.

653
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:05,178
- You're dead.
- Swan!

654
01:27:33,457 --> 01:27:35,876
- Riffs!
- Yeah, right!

655
01:28:04,613 --> 01:28:06,573
You still looking for us?

656
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:11,411
We found what we're looking for.

657
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:17,167
No.

658
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:19,294
It wasn't us.

659
01:28:19,294 --> 01:28:22,130
It was them, the Warriors.

660
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:25,383
You Warriors are good.

661
01:28:26,718 --> 01:28:28,011
Real good.

662
01:28:30,764 --> 01:28:31,973
The best.

663
01:28:33,683 --> 01:28:35,268
The rest is ours.

664
01:29:05,382 --> 01:29:08,969
No.

665
01:29:11,263 --> 01:29:15,225
Good news, boppers.
The big alert has been called off.

666
01:29:15,225 --> 01:29:19,938
It turns out that the early reports
were wrong, all wrong.

667
01:29:19,938 --> 01:29:24,442
Now for that group out there
that had such a hard time getting home,

668
01:29:24,442 --> 01:29:26,444
sorry about that.

669
01:29:26,444 --> 01:29:29,698
I guess the only thing we can do
is play you a song.
