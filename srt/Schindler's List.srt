1
00:02:15,355 --> 00:02:16,599
Name?

2
00:02:16,695 --> 00:02:17,984
Horowitz, Salomon.

3
00:02:22,326 --> 00:02:24,061
Schneider, Sarah.

4
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:25,607
Birnbaum, Olga.

5
00:02:28,826 --> 00:02:29,558
- Over there.
- Come here.

6
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:30,605
Over there.

7
00:02:31,897 --> 00:02:33,213
Isak Hudes

8
00:02:36,064 --> 00:02:37,542
Zucker, Helena

9
00:02:37,887 --> 00:02:39,897
Zucker, Helena

10
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:41,972
Hirsch, Salomon

11
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,292
Hirsch, Salomon

12
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:44,463
Hauptman, Chaim

13
00:02:44,807 --> 00:02:46,808
Weisman. Weisman, Marcus

14
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:47,978
Feber, Ludwig

15
00:02:48,444 --> 00:02:49,496
Feber, Ludwig

16
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,099
Elsa Bauman

17
00:02:53,088 --> 00:02:54,921
- Josef Klein
- Klein

18
00:02:55,177 --> 00:02:56,502
Davidowich, Ignacy

19
00:02:56,758 --> 00:02:57,766
Paula Biffer

20
00:02:57,826 --> 00:02:59,282
Nadel, Rachela

21
00:02:59,528 --> 00:03:01,111
- Steiner, Gertruda
- Steiner, Hilda

22
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:58,030
- Jerzy, do you know who that man is?
- I don't know.

23
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:18,379
Let's get together, please.

24
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:21,249
Smile. Good.

25
00:05:51,386 --> 00:05:52,233
Yes, sir

26
00:05:54,553 --> 00:05:56,282
Bring them over a round of drinks.

27
00:05:58,241 --> 00:06:01,109
Very good, sir.
And who shall I say they are from?

28
00:06:03,511 --> 00:06:04,926
You can say they are from me.

29
00:06:25,483 --> 00:06:26,785
From the gentleman.

30
00:06:27,205 --> 00:06:28,067
Where?

31
00:06:33,802 --> 00:06:34,786
Do you know him?

32
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,496
Find out who he is.

33
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,642
Yes, sir

34
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:47,336
Agnieszka,
I would
give anything to hear you sing tonight

35
00:06:47,802 --> 00:06:49,375
but I know you won't.

36
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,501
You embarrass me.

37
00:07:02,739 --> 00:07:03,710
What's he doing?

38
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:07,944
Stay here.

39
00:07:12,696 --> 00:07:13,667
How are you doing?

40
00:07:14,176 --> 00:07:16,556
You'd leave a woman
alone at the table in a place like this?

41
00:07:18,628 --> 00:07:20,758
Sweetheart, you're the picture of loneliness.

42
00:07:21,597 --> 00:07:22,321
Oh

43
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,351
Mmm what a
lovely fragrance. You are breaking my heart.

44
00:07:26,518 --> 00:07:28,884
An extra chair, please. Vodka for my friend.

45
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:30,103
And for the lady?

46
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:31,337
Pernod.

47
00:07:41,633 --> 00:07:44,033
Come to the table, girls. Drink with us.

48
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,653
Come to us. Marry us.

49
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,789
Thank you.

50
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,845
I'll tell you what I mean by cooperative.

51
00:08:12,998 --> 00:08:14,352
Two days after the law is passed

52
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,059
that all jews have to wear the star

53
00:08:16,217 --> 00:08:18,060
the jewish tailors
are turning them out by the gross

54
00:08:18,118 --> 00:08:20,647
in a variety of fabrics at three zloty each.

55
00:08:20,774 --> 00:08:22,221
Tell me about your cellar wines.

56
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,578
- I have an excellent German Riesling: 1937.
- Mmm French

57
00:08:25,837 --> 00:08:28,476
- A Bordeaux: Chateau Latour, '28, '29?
- No, I'm sorry.

58
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:31,124
It's as if
they have no idea what kind of law it is.

59
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:33,740
As if it's the emblem of a riding club.

60
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,525
- A Margaux, '29?
- No no, we don't have that.

61
00:08:35,696 --> 00:08:38,281
- Burgundy then? A Romanee-Conti, '37?
- Yes

62
00:08:38,499 --> 00:08:40,884
It's
human nature: "We'll do this to avoid that."

63
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,660
That's what
they have done since thousands of years.

64
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:45,893
It's what they do. They weather the storm

65
00:08:45,952 --> 00:08:49,380
but this storm is different.
This is not the Romans. This storm is the SS.

66
00:09:19,596 --> 00:09:20,265
Martin

67
00:09:21,313 --> 00:09:22,127
Yes, sir

68
00:09:23,662 --> 00:09:24,593
Who is that man?

69
00:09:26,768 --> 00:09:28,453
That's Oskar Schindler.

70
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:21,952
<i>To all jews:</i>

71
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:26,146
<i>From now on all jews are forbidden</i>

72
00:10:26,204 --> 00:10:28,814
<i>to prepare meat in the kosher manner.</i>

73
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:32,403
<i>Message to all jews. From now on</i>

74
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,922
- Rabbi
- Private property cannot be confiscated.

75
00:10:54,981 --> 00:10:55,932
How long are the schools going to be closed?

76
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,566
I do not know.

77
00:10:56,769 --> 00:10:58,523
<i>Article 47: Pillage is formally prohibited.</i>

78
00:10:58,682 --> 00:10:59,692
You don't know anything.

79
00:10:59,812 --> 00:11:01,757
I am familiar
with the Hague Convention. Religious...

80
00:11:01,817 --> 00:11:05,543
They come into our house
and tell us we don't live there anymore.

81
00:11:06,174 --> 00:11:08,735
It now belongs to a certain SS officer.

82
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,827
Please. I only know what they tell me

83
00:11:10,884 --> 00:11:13,913
and
what they tell me changes from day to day.

84
00:11:13,971 --> 00:11:16,117
Aren't you supposed to be able to help?

85
00:11:17,005 --> 00:11:19,851
I mean, what if I just took this thing off.

86
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,504
What are they going to do about it?

87
00:11:21,694 --> 00:11:22,773
They will shoot you.

88
00:11:23,053 --> 00:11:25,332
- Why don't you stop this silly talk?
- Itzhak Stern

89
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,567
I'm looking for Itzhak Stern.

90
00:11:31,689 --> 00:11:33,263
Are you Itzhak Stern or not?

91
00:11:34,803 --> 00:11:36,779
- I am.
- Where can we talk?

92
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:49,991
There's a company
you did the books for on Lipowa Street.

93
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,905
It made... what? pots and pans?

94
00:11:53,287 --> 00:11:55,534
By law I have to tell you, sir: I'm a jew.

95
00:11:56,322 --> 00:11:58,739
Well, I'm a German. So there we are.

96
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:03,963
A good company, you think?

97
00:12:04,112 --> 00:12:05,400
Modestly successful.

98
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:08,457
I know nothing about enamelware. Do you?

99
00:12:08,534 --> 00:12:09,985
I was just the accountant.

100
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:13,144
Simple engineering though,
wouldn't you think?

101
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:14,732
Change
the machines around, whatever you do...

102
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,187
you could make other things, couldn't you?

103
00:12:17,338 --> 00:12:21,358
...field kits, mess kits: army contracts.

104
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:26,342
Once the war ends
forget it, but for now it's great.

105
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:27,850
You could make a fortune, don't you think?

106
00:12:28,257 --> 00:12:30,925
I think
most people right now have other priorities.

107
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,976
Like what?

108
00:12:34,937 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm sure you'll
do just fine once you get the contracts.

109
00:12:37,058 --> 00:12:38,880
In fact
the worse things get, the better you'll do.

110
00:12:38,937 --> 00:12:42,202
Oh I can get
the signatures I need. That's the easy part.

111
00:12:42,817 --> 00:12:45,465
Finding
the money to buy the company: that's hard.

112
00:12:46,377 --> 00:12:47,817
You don't have any money?

113
00:12:47,896 --> 00:12:51,444
Not that kind of money. Do you know anybody?

114
00:12:53,656 --> 00:12:55,904
Jews, yeah. Investors

115
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,634
You must have contacts in the
jewish business community, working here.

116
00:12:59,787 --> 00:13:02,274
What community?
Jews can no longer own businesses.

117
00:13:02,351 --> 00:13:03,654
That's why this one's in receivership.

118
00:13:03,775 --> 00:13:04,995
But they wouldn't own it.

119
00:13:05,135 --> 00:13:08,016
I'd own it.
I'd pay them back in product, pots and pans.

120
00:13:08,336 --> 00:13:09,283
Pots and pans:

121
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,105
something they can use

122
00:13:11,735 --> 00:13:13,117
something they can feel in their hands.

123
00:13:13,175 --> 00:13:14,442
They can trade it on the black market

124
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,244
do whatever they want. Everybody's happy.

125
00:13:19,011 --> 00:13:20,937
If you want,
you could run the company for me.

126
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,165
Let me understand.

127
00:13:28,213 --> 00:13:30,665
They'd
put up all the money. I'd do all the work.

128
00:13:30,725 --> 00:13:32,537
What,
if you don't mind my asking, would you do?

129
00:13:34,255 --> 00:13:36,197
I'd make sure
it's known, the company's in business.

130
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:38,436
I'd see that it had a certain panache.

131
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:40,914
That's what
I'm good at, not the work, not the work:

132
00:13:42,694 --> 00:13:43,592
the presentation.

133
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:05,116
I'm sure I don't know
anybody who'll be interested in this.

134
00:14:07,788 --> 00:14:09,616
Well, they should be, Itzhak Stern.

135
00:14:11,444 --> 00:14:12,587
Tell them they should be.

136
00:14:22,933 --> 00:14:24,700
<i>Attention. Attention.</i>

137
00:14:25,054 --> 00:14:30,342
<i>To all jews. From now on it is forbidden...</i>

138
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,064
I've got a client
who'll sell marks for zloty at 2.45 to 1.

139
00:14:47,123 --> 00:14:48,924
Wool, mink collar. It's a nice coat.

140
00:14:49,092 --> 00:14:50,892
She'll trade it for ration coupons.

141
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,577
Wicks for lamps.

142
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:54,341
You have a truckload of wicks?

143
00:14:54,411 --> 00:14:56,616
What
am I going to do with a truckload of wicks?

144
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,121
Nine by 12, nine by 14.

145
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,655
- I don't know.
- Big, beautiful, Persian

146
00:15:04,728 --> 00:15:05,328
Past

147
00:15:06,026 --> 00:15:06,506
What?

148
00:15:06,766 --> 00:15:08,567
You don't recognize this? It's shoe polish.

149
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:09,800
In metal containers?

150
00:15:10,418 --> 00:15:11,313
You asked for shoe polish.

151
00:15:11,371 --> 00:15:13,274
...in metal containers. This is glass.

152
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,313
It's not what I asked for.

153
00:15:14,429 --> 00:15:16,006
- What's the difference?
- What's the difference?

154
00:15:16,103 --> 00:15:17,032
What's the difference?

155
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,352
My client sold it to his client

156
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,775
who sold it to the German army

157
00:15:21,092 --> 00:15:22,532
only, by the time it got there, because

158
00:15:22,592 --> 00:15:25,391
of the
freezing cold, it broke. All 10,000 units.

159
00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:27,654
Mmm ooh ooh ooh. This is not my problem.

160
00:15:27,729 --> 00:15:29,232
- This is not his problem.
- This is not your problem?

161
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:30,279
This is not my problem.

162
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:31,938
All right.

163
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,511
The German army
wants to find out where it came from.

164
00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:38,020
I am going to make sure they find out.

165
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:39,183
Now it's your problem.

166
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:39,976
You, be quiet.

167
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:44,176
Metal containers.

168
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:46,558
Hello

169
00:15:48,205 --> 00:15:50,934
Pardon me
for interfering, but that's a nice shirt.

170
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,063
...a nice shirt.

171
00:15:54,608 --> 00:15:56,564
Do you know
where I can find a nice shirt like that?

172
00:16:04,862 --> 00:16:05,732
Like this?

173
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:09,072
It's illegal
to buy or sell anything on the street.

174
00:16:09,491 --> 00:16:11,935
We don't do that. We're here to pray.

175
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:20,294
Do you have
any idea how much a shirt like this costs?

176
00:16:20,366 --> 00:16:21,652
Nice things cost money.

177
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:35,923
How many?

178
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,673
I'm going to need
some other things too, as things come up

179
00:16:41,405 --> 00:16:42,347
This won't be a problem.

180
00:16:42,505 --> 00:16:43,492
...from time to time.

181
00:16:45,256 --> 00:16:47,003
<i>Attention. Attention.</i>

182
00:17:28,206 --> 00:17:29,738
Name? Address?

183
00:17:29,922 --> 00:17:31,122
Fill out the form.

184
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,381
Move on. move on.

185
00:17:32,613 --> 00:17:33,424
Don't push.

186
00:17:33,629 --> 00:17:34,552
Come here.

187
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,514
Stand by.

188
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,091
<i>Attention. Attention.</i>

189
00:18:23,204 --> 00:18:25,369
<i>All jews are accommodated</i>

190
00:18:25,476 --> 00:18:28,564
<i>in the separate jewish district.</i>

191
00:18:28,723 --> 00:18:32,756
<i>Failure
to comply with the obligation to report</i>

192
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:37,098
<i>to the resident's authority
will be dealt by the military court.</i>

193
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:42,363
This is
obviously the right place. How are you doing?

194
00:18:46,881 --> 00:18:50,363
Goodbye, jews. Goodbye, jews.

195
00:18:50,749 --> 00:18:52,473
Goodbye, jews.

196
00:18:56,841 --> 00:19:00,485
Goodbye, jews. Goodbye, jews.

197
00:19:01,321 --> 00:19:03,174
Goodbye, jews.

198
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,686
- This is the vecheka, Moyshe.
- Ojciec.

199
00:19:08,343 --> 00:19:09,805
No. This can't be true.

200
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:24,020
Oh my God

201
00:19:25,219 --> 00:19:27,734
Oy God. Oh my God

202
00:19:34,988 --> 00:19:36,076
Oh my God

203
00:19:44,254 --> 00:19:45,297
It could not be better.

204
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,446
It could be worse.

205
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:49,199
How? Tell me.

206
00:19:49,638 --> 00:19:52,501
How on earth could it possibly be worse?

207
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,254
Good morning

208
00:19:56,956 --> 00:19:57,726
Good morning

209
00:19:57,784 --> 00:19:58,810
Good morning

210
00:19:59,225 --> 00:20:00,091
Good morning

211
00:20:00,852 --> 00:20:01,626
Good morning

212
00:20:01,685 --> 00:20:02,446
Good morning

213
00:20:07,062 --> 00:20:08,374
- Hey, Goldberg
- Poldek

214
00:20:08,517 --> 00:20:09,619
What's this?

215
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:13,081
The Judenrat has its own police now, Poldek.

216
00:20:13,157 --> 00:20:13,879
You don't say.

217
00:20:14,168 --> 00:20:15,172
"Ordnungsdienst"

218
00:20:15,624 --> 00:20:18,517
- I'm a policeman now. Could you believe it?
- It's hard to believe.

219
00:20:18,597 --> 00:20:19,908
No, it's not hard to believe.

220
00:20:20,516 --> 00:20:22,524
It's
a good racket, Poldek, the only racket here.

221
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:25,563
Look. Maybe I could
put in a good word for you with my superiors.

222
00:20:25,795 --> 00:20:26,755
Your superiors?

223
00:20:27,156 --> 00:20:29,299
Come on.
They are not as bad as everyone says.

224
00:20:30,377 --> 00:20:32,073
Well, they're worse than everyone says

225
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:34,542
but it's a lot of money, a lot of money.

226
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:37,677
Give me my housing assignment.

227
00:20:38,755 --> 00:20:39,689
Come on.

228
00:20:40,225 --> 00:20:41,857
You look funny in that hat, Goldberg.

229
00:20:43,715 --> 00:20:45,254
You look like a clown, you know.

230
00:20:51,915 --> 00:20:54,961
He's a very important man.
Just give him two minutes of your time.

231
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:58,079
- Since when did time cost money?
- Just sit down and listen.

232
00:20:58,715 --> 00:20:59,838
Please. Sir?

233
00:21:04,113 --> 00:21:06,274
For
each 1,000 you invest, I will repay you with

234
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,388
two hundred kilos of enamelware a month

235
00:21:08,446 --> 00:21:10,215
to begin
in July and to continue for one year

236
00:21:10,273 --> 00:21:11,545
after which time, we're even.

237
00:21:12,315 --> 00:21:13,986
That's it. It's very simple.

238
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:15,074
Not good enough.

239
00:21:15,132 --> 00:21:16,172
It's not good enough.

240
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:17,969
Not good enough?

241
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:22,802
Look where you're living. Look
where you've been put. "Not good enough."

242
00:21:23,153 --> 00:21:25,205
A couple
of months ago you'd be right. Not anymore.

243
00:21:25,754 --> 00:21:27,590
Money's still money.

244
00:21:30,432 --> 00:21:31,511
No, it is not.

245
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,852
That's why we're here.

246
00:21:34,392 --> 00:21:36,113
Trade goods: that's the only currency

247
00:21:36,174 --> 00:21:37,882
that'll be worth anything in the ghetto.

248
00:21:38,111 --> 00:21:39,773
Things have changed, my friend.

249
00:21:43,071 --> 00:21:44,164
Did I call this meeting?

250
00:21:45,312 --> 00:21:47,035
You told Mr. Stern you wanted to speak to me.

251
00:21:47,111 --> 00:21:48,668
I'm here. I've made you a fair offer.

252
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,834
Fair would be a percentage in the company.

253
00:21:55,429 --> 00:21:57,228
Forget the whole thing. Get out.

254
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,598
How do we know that you will do what you say?

255
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,297
Because I said I would.

256
00:22:07,628 --> 00:22:09,908
You want
a contract? To be upheld by what court?

257
00:22:09,966 --> 00:22:11,709
I said what I'll do. That's our contract.

258
00:22:16,062 --> 00:22:17,055
We were right.

259
00:22:30,312 --> 00:22:33,557
...five, six, seven

260
00:22:35,552 --> 00:22:37,079
eight, nine...

261
00:22:49,551 --> 00:22:53,080
The standard SS rate for
jewish skilled labourers is seven marks a day

262
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,236
five for unskilled and women.

263
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:59,378
This
is what you pay the Reich Economic Office.

264
00:22:59,436 --> 00:23:01,432
The jews themselves receive nothing.

265
00:23:02,267 --> 00:23:03,483
Poles: you pay wages.

266
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:05,914
Generally they get a little more.

267
00:23:06,223 --> 00:23:07,131
Are you listening?

268
00:23:07,312 --> 00:23:08,631
What was that about the SS?

269
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:10,417
The rate? The what?

270
00:23:11,069 --> 00:23:12,167
The jewish worker's salary.

271
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:14,271
You pay it
directly to the SS, not to the worker.

272
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:16,228
- He gets nothing.
- But it's less.

273
00:23:16,363 --> 00:23:17,834
It's less than what I would pay a Pole.

274
00:23:17,892 --> 00:23:18,515
It's less.

275
00:23:18,695 --> 00:23:20,314
That's the point I'm trying to make.

276
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,831
Poles cost more.

277
00:23:25,026 --> 00:23:26,747
Why should I hire Poles?

278
00:23:28,467 --> 00:23:31,589
An enamelware factory over at Lipowa Street.

279
00:23:33,628 --> 00:23:35,044
It's owned by a German

280
00:23:35,102 --> 00:23:38,908
but it's outside the ghetto,
so you can barter for extra goods

281
00:23:38,987 --> 00:23:40,435
for eggs, I don't know what you need

282
00:23:40,493 --> 00:23:42,113
with
the Polish workers. You can't get it here.

283
00:23:42,427 --> 00:23:45,793
Also,
he's asking for 10 healthy women for the...

284
00:23:45,851 --> 00:23:46,715
I am healthy.

285
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,504
Bring your sister, OK?

286
00:23:54,811 --> 00:23:55,627
Come.

287
00:23:56,251 --> 00:23:58,007
You need to convince them you have a trade

288
00:23:58,065 --> 00:23:59,542
something valuable to the war effort.

289
00:23:59,601 --> 00:24:00,238
- Like what?
- What if you don't?

290
00:24:00,342 --> 00:24:01,309
I'm a musician.

291
00:24:01,988 --> 00:24:02,898
Your name goes on a list.

292
00:24:02,963 --> 00:24:05,149
I hear your name
goes on a list and they put you on trucks...

293
00:24:05,225 --> 00:24:07,146
- No no. That's not true.
- You're a musician?

294
00:24:07,225 --> 00:24:08,242
- Lisa
- Yeah

295
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,754
I'd find a good hiding place if I were you.

296
00:24:09,813 --> 00:24:11,592
I'm not going to hide like some animal.

297
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:13,534
There are places to hide.

298
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,821
I'm a graduate of the University of Lviv.

299
00:24:24,232 --> 00:24:26,838
I used to work
at the hydroelectric station in Roznow.

300
00:24:26,905 --> 00:24:27,797
Blue card

301
00:24:32,214 --> 00:24:33,645
I'm going to get the necessary papers

302
00:24:33,879 --> 00:24:35,560
because this card is no good anymore.

303
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,389
You can stay in this line
all day. You'll still get one of these.

304
00:24:38,446 --> 00:24:41,896
They are
no good. You'll have to leave the line now.

305
00:24:42,112 --> 00:24:44,089
Then you'll get a blue card, a <i>blauschein</i>

306
00:24:44,496 --> 00:24:46,472
to say that you are an essential worker.

307
00:24:46,543 --> 00:24:48,828
I'll get these papers for you at Pankiewicz.

308
00:24:49,847 --> 00:24:51,228
Pharmacist. Just there, look.

309
00:24:52,168 --> 00:24:52,789
Guess who is here?

310
00:24:53,343 --> 00:24:56,026
Poldek. Enjoying the weather, Poldek?

311
00:24:56,103 --> 00:24:57,099
Enjoying the lines?

312
00:24:57,427 --> 00:24:58,715
Need some shoe polish?

313
00:24:58,901 --> 00:25:00,030
In a metal container maybe?

314
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:02,553
Not essential?

315
00:25:02,957 --> 00:25:05,672
I think
you misunderstand the meaning of the word.

316
00:25:06,103 --> 00:25:07,532
No blue card, sir.

317
00:25:07,617 --> 00:25:09,876
Stand over there. Move. Next.

318
00:25:11,478 --> 00:25:12,987
What do you mean, "not essential"?

319
00:25:14,542 --> 00:25:16,668
I teach history and literature.

320
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:18,922
Since when it's not essential?

321
00:25:24,516 --> 00:25:25,672
He's a metal polisher.

322
00:25:33,537 --> 00:25:34,431
It was not right?

323
00:25:34,489 --> 00:25:36,018
It's very good. He's 53 years old.

324
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:37,029
It's too new.

325
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,112
Mmm thank you.

326
00:25:46,873 --> 00:25:48,793
You're crazy. You left it in your drawer.

327
00:25:49,306 --> 00:25:50,897
How many times have I told you?

328
00:25:51,421 --> 00:25:54,137
"Your work certificate
you keep in your pocket at all times"

329
00:25:54,301 --> 00:25:57,629
and you leave yours
in your drawer! How many times I've told you?

330
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,553
I'm a metal polisher.

331
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,996
Take the round sheet of tin

332
00:26:13,441 --> 00:26:15,801
dip it in soap emulsion

333
00:26:17,178 --> 00:26:20,382
then place it centrally in the press.

334
00:26:35,821 --> 00:26:37,128
We obtain the soup pot.

335
00:26:38,093 --> 00:26:38,921
...the soup pot.

336
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,541
...soup pot.

337
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:44,505
Grosz, Mrs. Grosz, stay together.

338
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,555
Sir, I have 10 work permits here

339
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:54,667
for the Deutsche Emailwarenfabrik.

340
00:26:57,698 --> 00:27:01,495
If it's carbonized, clean it with a file

341
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:06,359
but don't touch
both the electrodes at the same time.

342
00:27:06,777 --> 00:27:09,582
You'll get electrocuted. Here. Have a try.

343
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:15,792
Roll the metal under the press

344
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,625
but
be very careful unless you want your fingers

345
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,467
to become part of the teapot.

346
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:23,758
Occupation?

347
00:27:23,997 --> 00:27:26,387
I'm a writer. I play the flute.

348
00:27:26,446 --> 00:27:29,936
But Moses is a skilled metalworker.

349
00:27:29,994 --> 00:27:32,007
He can make tin pots. He can make tanks.

350
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:33,821
He can make whatever Mr. Schindler asks.

351
00:27:33,899 --> 00:27:37,728
He's highly skilled. Give him
your card. Moses, give him your card.

352
00:27:40,841 --> 00:27:44,902
Now, dip the basin
with the tongs into the enamel solution

353
00:27:47,498 --> 00:27:51,457
and after swivelling it around,
carefully place it aside to drip dry.

354
00:27:54,738 --> 00:27:56,356
And whatever he asks you, allow me

355
00:27:56,415 --> 00:27:58,378
just to represent you and speak for you.

356
00:27:58,458 --> 00:27:59,867
Don't say a word.

357
00:28:00,339 --> 00:28:03,545
Filing, billing,
keeping track of my appointments, shorthand

358
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,848
typing, obviously... How is your typing?

359
00:28:06,968 --> 00:28:07,739
Uh all right.

360
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,311
Please

361
00:29:00,457 --> 00:29:02,378
You need a secretary. Pick one.

362
00:29:04,334 --> 00:29:07,456
I don't know how. They're all so... qualified.

363
00:29:08,927 --> 00:29:10,166
You have to choose.

364
00:29:13,598 --> 00:29:14,514
Please give a nice smile.

365
00:29:14,572 --> 00:29:15,948
Big smile. Big smile.

366
00:29:16,014 --> 00:29:16,864
Attention.

367
00:29:36,253 --> 00:29:38,723
If you would, look after my guest.

368
00:29:40,497 --> 00:29:43,427
Boxed teas are good. Coffee, pate

369
00:29:44,652 --> 00:29:47,380
kielbasa sausage, cheeses, Beluga caviar.

370
00:29:48,091 --> 00:29:49,061
- Yes
- And of course

371
00:29:49,132 --> 00:29:50,195
who could live without German cigarettes?

372
00:29:50,253 --> 00:29:51,677
Get me as many as you can find

373
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:53,771
and some more fresh fruit

374
00:29:54,734 --> 00:29:56,901
the real
rarities: oranges, lemons, pineapples.

375
00:29:57,503 --> 00:29:59,777
I need
several boxes of Cuban cigars, the best

376
00:30:00,212 --> 00:30:01,474
yes and dark, unsweetened chocolate.

377
00:30:01,652 --> 00:30:03,688
not in the shape
of lady fingers, the chunk chocolate

378
00:30:03,771 --> 00:30:05,479
big as my hand, you sample at wine tastings.

379
00:30:06,154 --> 00:30:06,731
Yes

380
00:30:06,851 --> 00:30:09,550
We're going to
need lots of cognac, the best: Hennessy

381
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,205
Dom Perignon champagne.

382
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,191
Get L'Espadon sardines

383
00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:17,694
and oh, try to find nylon stockings.

384
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:23,725
<i>It is my distinct pleasure to announce</i>

385
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:28,832
<i>the fully operational
status of Deutsche Emailwarenfabrik</i>

386
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:29,899

<i>Oskar Schindler.</i>

402
00:31:17,771 --> 00:31:20,774
Yeah. I need
700 gross from here for next Thursday.

403
00:31:21,085 --> 00:31:23,604
Nine hundred...
No. Make it 10 for Wednesday.

404
00:31:23,665 --> 00:31:25,431
All this stuff here goes to Madritsch's

405
00:31:25,489 --> 00:31:27,257
factory on Tuesday of next week.

406
00:31:43,005 --> 00:31:45,622
My father was fond
of saying, "You need three things in life:

407
00:31:46,459 --> 00:31:47,500
"a good doctor

408
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:49,752
"a forgiving priest

409
00:31:50,598 --> 00:31:51,928
"and a clever accountant."

410
00:31:56,564 --> 00:31:57,724
The first two

411
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,266
I've never had much use for

412
00:32:00,573 --> 00:32:02,335
but the third...

413
00:32:09,285 --> 00:32:11,805
Just pretend, for Christ's sake.

414
00:32:16,209 --> 00:32:17,029
Is that all?

415
00:32:23,765 --> 00:32:24,948
I'm trying to thank you.

416
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:29,680
I'm saying,
I couldn't have done this without you.

417
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,868
The usual thing
would be to acknowledge my gratitude.

418
00:32:35,952 --> 00:32:37,989
It would also,
by the way, be the courteous thing.

419
00:32:40,965 --> 00:32:41,811
You're welcome.

420
00:32:52,149 --> 00:32:52,897
Get out of here.

421
00:33:06,843 --> 00:33:08,835
Klonowska, who is it?

422
00:33:19,003 --> 00:33:20,771
She's so embarrassed. Look at her.

423
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,675
You know something? You would like her.

424
00:33:35,282 --> 00:33:36,498
- Oskar, please
- What?

425
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,698
I don't
have to like her just because you do.

426
00:33:38,757 --> 00:33:39,447
You would, though.

427
00:33:39,505 --> 00:33:40,591
It doesn't work that way.

428
00:33:54,977 --> 00:33:56,158
You've done well here.

429
00:33:59,566 --> 00:34:00,654
You look wonderful.

430
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,287
Be careful of the step, miss.

431
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,849
Mrs. Schindler, Marek

432
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,164
It's not a charade, all this?

433
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:24,326
A charade? How could it be a charade?

434
00:34:24,387 --> 00:34:25,628
The clothes, the car, the apartment...

435
00:34:25,686 --> 00:34:26,527
Wait a minute.

436
00:34:26,585 --> 00:34:29,280
Take a guess.
How many people are on my payroll?

437
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,286
Oskar

438
00:34:30,833 --> 00:34:34,927
My father, at the height
of his success, had 50. I've got 350

439
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,179
350 workers

440
00:34:37,237 --> 00:34:39,367
on the factory floor, with one purpose:

441
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:41,896
...to make pots and pans?

442
00:34:42,358 --> 00:34:43,311
...to make money

443
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:44,882
for me.

444
00:34:51,878 --> 00:34:54,364
Does anyone ask about me?

445
00:34:56,318 --> 00:34:57,179
Back home?

446
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,205
Everybody

447
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:00,476
all the time.

448
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:02,822
Hmm

449
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:09,978
They won't soon forget the name,
Schindler here. I can tell you that.

450
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,565
"Oskar Schindler," they'll say.

451
00:35:15,318 --> 00:35:17,072
"Everybody remembers him.

452
00:35:19,237 --> 00:35:21,956
"He did something extraordinary.

453
00:35:23,837 --> 00:35:25,664
"He did something no one else did.

454
00:35:28,596 --> 00:35:30,132
"He came here with nothing

455
00:35:31,476 --> 00:35:32,567
"a suitcase

456
00:35:34,076 --> 00:35:38,201
"and built
a bankrupt company into a major manufactory.

457
00:35:40,237 --> 00:35:42,243
"and left with a steamer trunk

458
00:35:43,155 --> 00:35:45,590
"two steamer trunks full of money

459
00:35:48,022 --> 00:35:49,764
"all the riches of the world."

460
00:35:52,114 --> 00:35:52,788
Hmm

461
00:35:53,956 --> 00:35:56,578
It's
comforting to see that nothing's changed.

462
00:35:56,835 --> 00:35:58,480
You're wrong, Emilie.

463
00:36:00,868 --> 00:36:03,021
There's
no way I could have known this before

464
00:36:03,514 --> 00:36:05,130
but there was always something missing.

465
00:36:10,094 --> 00:36:11,464
Something was missing.

466
00:36:13,099 --> 00:36:14,449
Even if I'd known what it was

467
00:36:14,509 --> 00:36:17,047
there's nothing
I could have done about it because

468
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,772
you can't create this thing

469
00:36:21,114 --> 00:36:24,802
and it makes all the difference
in the world between success and failure.

470
00:36:26,949 --> 00:36:27,585
Luck?

471
00:36:30,853 --> 00:36:31,677
War!

472
00:36:56,404 --> 00:36:57,643
Should I stay?

473
00:37:00,472 --> 00:37:01,795
It's a beautiful city.

474
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,168
I asked you if I should stay.

475
00:37:09,707 --> 00:37:10,629
It's up to you.

476
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,278
Promise me, Oskar

477
00:37:17,957 --> 00:37:20,345
no doorman or maitre d' will ever presume

478
00:37:20,432 --> 00:37:22,142
I'm anyone other than Mrs. Schindler

479
00:37:23,004 --> 00:37:23,990
and I'll stay.

480
00:37:27,718 --> 00:37:28,689
Goodbye, darling

481
00:37:45,752 --> 00:37:48,927
I could try to read this
or I could eat my lunch while it's still hot.

482
00:37:50,575 --> 00:37:51,512
We're doing well?

483
00:37:51,751 --> 00:37:52,995
- Yes
- Better this month than last?

484
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:53,515
Yes

485
00:37:53,573 --> 00:37:55,325
Any reason to think next month will be worse?

486
00:37:55,383 --> 00:37:56,492
The war could end.

487
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:08,752
What?

488
00:38:09,091 --> 00:38:10,452
There is a machinist outside

489
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,762
who'd like
to thank you personally for giving him a job.

490
00:38:13,908 --> 00:38:14,736
Every day he comes.

491
00:38:15,051 --> 00:38:17,046
He's very grateful. It'll just take a minute.

492
00:38:24,234 --> 00:38:25,298
Mr. Lowenstein?

493
00:38:33,135 --> 00:38:35,713
I want to thank you, sir

494
00:38:36,224 --> 00:38:38,631
for giving me the opportunity to work.

495
00:38:38,747 --> 00:38:40,925
You're welcome.
I'm sure you're doing a great job.

496
00:38:41,787 --> 00:38:45,936
The SS beat me up. They would have killed me

497
00:38:46,421 --> 00:38:49,834
but I am
essential to the war effort, thanks to you.

498
00:38:50,669 --> 00:38:51,392
That's great.

499
00:38:52,428 --> 00:38:54,394
I work hard for you.

500
00:38:54,682 --> 00:38:55,816
I'm sure you do.

501
00:38:55,876 --> 00:38:58,497
I'll continue to work hard for you.

502
00:38:59,307 --> 00:39:00,671
That's great. Thanks.

503
00:39:00,729 --> 00:39:01,776
God bless you, sir.

504
00:39:02,472 --> 00:39:03,207
All right.

505
00:39:03,265 --> 00:39:04,562
You are a good man.

506
00:39:08,385 --> 00:39:09,564
He saved my life.

507
00:39:09,622 --> 00:39:10,354
Yes, he did.

508
00:39:11,488 --> 00:39:12,320
God bless him.

509
00:39:12,378 --> 00:39:13,495
Yeah. Come on.

510
00:39:16,426 --> 00:39:17,675
God bless you.

511
00:39:30,378 --> 00:39:32,834
I'm sorry,
Herr Direktor, but you're running very late.

512
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:36,162
This is for the Obersturmbannfuhrer, sir

513
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:39,185
and this is
for his niece, Greta. It's her birthday.

514
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:39,624
By the way

515
00:39:39,684 --> 00:39:40,531
Greta as in Garbo.

516
00:39:40,589 --> 00:39:42,356
don't ever do that to me again.

517
00:39:42,865 --> 00:39:44,392
Go go. drive. Don't bow.

518
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:46,327
Did you happen to notice that
that man had one arm?

519
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:47,115
Did he?

520
00:39:51,879 --> 00:39:52,927
What's his use?

521
00:39:52,986 --> 00:39:53,801
Very useful.

522
00:39:57,064 --> 00:39:57,821
How?

523
00:39:57,879 --> 00:39:59,282
Very useful.

524
00:40:28,184 --> 00:40:30,001
Brooms and shovels have been unloaded.

525
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,852
Everyone take one and clean the streets.

526
00:40:32,984 --> 00:40:34,392
We'll be late for work.

527
00:40:47,102 --> 00:40:49,503
You shouldn't think of them as yours, Oskar.

528
00:40:49,821 --> 00:40:51,830
You need to understand
that some of the officers here

529
00:40:51,903 --> 00:40:53,747
don't give a damn about production.

530
00:40:54,861 --> 00:40:56,608
To them it's a matter of

531
00:40:57,312 --> 00:41:00,408
national priority
that jews be made to shovel snow.

532
00:41:01,102 --> 00:41:03,115
It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar.

533
00:41:03,446 --> 00:41:04,848
You know it and I know it.

534
00:41:05,702 --> 00:41:07,263
Jews shovelling snow:

535
00:41:07,747 --> 00:41:11,033
It's got a ritual significance.

536
00:41:13,941 --> 00:41:14,812
Come with me.

537
00:41:15,979 --> 00:41:17,265
I am an essential worker.

538
00:41:17,352 --> 00:41:18,302
An essential worker?

539
00:41:18,894 --> 00:41:19,425
Yes

540
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,468
I work for Oskar Schindler.

541
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,260
An essential worker for Oskar Schindler.

542
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:27,153
A one-armed jew? Twice as useless!

543
00:41:27,213 --> 00:41:29,466
- Yes yes
- Twice as useless!

544
00:41:30,311 --> 00:41:32,872
I lost a day of production, Rolf.

545
00:41:33,258 --> 00:41:35,504
I work for Oskar Schindler.

546
00:41:36,939 --> 00:41:40,148
Danka, look at the snow.
Look at the snow. Look at the snow.

547
00:41:44,459 --> 00:41:45,655
I lost a worker.

548
00:41:46,609 --> 00:41:47,950
I expect to be compensated.

549
00:41:48,008 --> 00:41:49,946
File a grievance with the Economic Office.

550
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:50,919
It's your right.

551
00:41:50,977 --> 00:41:51,986
Would it do any good?

552
00:41:52,506 --> 00:41:53,158
Of course not.

553
00:41:56,617 --> 00:41:59,734
A big shot from the SS
Budget and Construction Office came to lunch

554
00:41:59,792 --> 00:42:01,838
and he told us that to believe

555
00:42:02,238 --> 00:42:04,385
the jewish skilled worker had a place in

556
00:42:04,593 --> 00:42:07,562
Reich economics was a treasonable idea.

557
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:16,198
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?

558
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,098
He was a metal press operator

559
00:42:23,198 --> 00:42:24,122
quite skilled.

560
00:42:53,464 --> 00:42:54,432
Herr Direktor?

561
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:57,379
Shit. I don't believe it.

562
00:42:57,537 --> 00:42:59,028
Stern, is that you?

563
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:00,937
No. It's Poldek.

564
00:43:01,984 --> 00:43:02,975
It's about Stern.

565
00:43:04,222 --> 00:43:06,948
Leave your luggage on the platform.

566
00:43:07,738 --> 00:43:09,178
Clearly label it.

567
00:43:09,874 --> 00:43:13,262
Given name first, then your surname.

568
00:43:13,537 --> 00:43:15,999
Do not bring your baggage with you.

569
00:43:16,185 --> 00:43:18,305
It will follow you later.

570
00:43:19,135 --> 00:43:22,276
Leave your luggage on the platform.

571
00:43:22,744 --> 00:43:24,211
Clearly label it.

572
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:26,981
Leave your luggage on the platform.

573
00:43:28,936 --> 00:43:29,821
Stern?

574
00:43:33,015 --> 00:43:33,769
He's on the list.

575
00:43:34,466 --> 00:43:35,276
He is?

576
00:43:36,176 --> 00:43:37,165
Well, let's find him.

577
00:43:37,535 --> 00:43:38,778
I'm sorry. You can't have him.

578
00:43:38,836 --> 00:43:39,622
He's on the list.

579
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:41,629
If he were an essential worker,
he would not be on the list.

580
00:43:41,687 --> 00:43:43,678
I'm talking to a clerk. What is your name?

581
00:43:44,374 --> 00:43:46,216
Sir, the list is correct.

582
00:43:46,274 --> 00:43:47,303
I didn't ask you about the list.

583
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:48,305
I asked you your name.

584
00:43:49,042 --> 00:43:49,872
Klaus Tauber

585
00:43:52,013 --> 00:43:52,682
Tauber

586
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:54,495
Hauptscharfuhrer

587
00:43:55,229 --> 00:43:57,260
This gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.

588
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,463
My plant manager is somewhere on this train.

589
00:43:59,975 --> 00:44:01,838
If it leaves
with him on it, it'll disrupt production

590
00:44:01,894 --> 00:44:03,729
and
the Armaments Board will want to know why.

591
00:44:03,894 --> 00:44:05,532
<i>Attention. This train is leaving now.</i>

592
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:06,561
Is he on the list?

593
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,593
Yes, sir

594
00:44:08,461 --> 00:44:10,080
Itzhak Stern

595
00:44:10,774 --> 00:44:11,336
Well

596
00:44:11,963 --> 00:44:13,350
the list is correct, sir.

597
00:44:13,906 --> 00:44:15,240
There is nothing I can do.

598
00:44:16,497 --> 00:44:17,258
What is your name?

599
00:44:17,814 --> 00:44:19,127
Close and secure all doors.

600
00:44:19,185 --> 00:44:19,894
My name?

601
00:44:21,206 --> 00:44:22,399
- My name is Kunder.
- This train is now leaving.

602
00:44:22,856 --> 00:44:24,372
Kunder, Hauptscharfuhrer Kunder

603
00:44:24,452 --> 00:44:26,252
K-U-N-D-E-R. And what's yours?

604
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,705
Schindler: S-C-H-I-N-D-L-E-R

605
00:44:29,013 --> 00:44:31,006
Gentlemen, thank you very much.

606
00:44:31,171 --> 00:44:32,169
I think I can guarantee you

607
00:44:32,963 --> 00:44:34,454
you'll both be in southern Russia

608
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,609
before the end of the month. Good day.

609
00:44:36,772 --> 00:44:37,839
Close the door properly.

610
00:44:37,897 --> 00:44:39,035
Close the door properly.

611
00:44:40,412 --> 00:44:41,292
Stern

612
00:44:42,731 --> 00:44:44,263
Stern Stern

613
00:44:44,502 --> 00:44:45,821
Itzhak Stern

614
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:54,531
Stern, Itzhak Stern

615
00:44:54,731 --> 00:44:55,975
Stern Stern

616
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:57,423
Itzhak Stern

617
00:44:58,850 --> 00:44:59,700
Stern

618
00:45:00,142 --> 00:45:00,698
Sir?

619
00:45:04,091 --> 00:45:06,052
- Stern
- Herr Direktor

620
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:08,397
My apologies.

621
00:45:09,236 --> 00:45:10,158
Stop the train.

622
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:10,868
I apologize.

623
00:45:10,927 --> 00:45:11,557
He's here.

624
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:13,084
Stop the train.

625
00:45:13,831 --> 00:45:15,854
Stop the train. Stop it.

626
00:45:28,588 --> 00:45:30,515
Sign here. Initial there.

627
00:45:32,649 --> 00:45:34,428
It makes no difference to us, you understand.

628
00:45:35,249 --> 00:45:36,307
This one, that one...

629
00:45:37,088 --> 00:45:38,446
It's the inconvenience to the list.

630
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:40,057
It's the paperwork.

631
00:45:40,345 --> 00:45:42,629
I somehow left my work card at home.

632
00:45:42,689 --> 00:45:45,733
I tried to
explain to them, it was a mistake but

633
00:45:46,568 --> 00:45:47,827
I'm sorry. It was stupid.

634
00:45:47,885 --> 00:45:49,629
What if I'd got here five minutes later?

635
00:45:50,552 --> 00:45:51,706
Then where would I be?

636
00:47:39,845 --> 00:47:41,660
I woke up from a dream this morning.

637
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:46,039
I was broke and
sharing a room with 12 people I didn't know

638
00:47:46,555 --> 00:47:49,682
only to discover I was broke and sharing

639
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,986
a room with 12 people I didn't know.

640
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:53,660
You laugh about it?

641
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:54,919
I have to laugh.

642
00:47:55,166 --> 00:47:57,454
You are living behind walls.

643
00:47:57,513 --> 00:47:59,135
The walls I can deal with.

644
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:02,332
It's
the restrictions to my life, I'm tired of.

645
00:48:02,439 --> 00:48:05,171
Those walls
keep them out. That's all I care about.

646
00:48:05,417 --> 00:48:06,200
I like it here.

647
00:48:06,691 --> 00:48:08,292
There's a kind of... I don't know

648
00:48:08,499 --> 00:48:10,325
...ancestral squalor to it all.

649
00:48:10,524 --> 00:48:12,493
- You are a slave to these people.
- No one envies us anymore.

650
00:48:12,551 --> 00:48:13,484
I'm smart.

651
00:48:13,604 --> 00:48:14,608
Oh yes, you're smart.

652
00:48:14,684 --> 00:48:15,644
You're a real genius.

653
00:48:15,778 --> 00:48:16,782
You had your chance.

654
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:21,252
Today, today
I actually found time to organize a thought.

655
00:48:21,883 --> 00:48:24,314
I can't remember the last time I did that.

656
00:48:24,524 --> 00:48:26,204
When's the last time we did this?

657
00:48:26,283 --> 00:48:28,412
When's
the last time we stood around and talked?

658
00:48:28,615 --> 00:48:31,575
No one ordered me onto a truck today.

659
00:48:31,811 --> 00:48:33,803
No one took my business away from me.

660
00:48:34,162 --> 00:48:35,519
You don't really have a business to take.

661
00:48:36,486 --> 00:48:38,486
There's nowhere down from here.

662
00:48:38,546 --> 00:48:40,080
This is it. This is the bottom.

663
00:48:40,883 --> 00:48:43,327
The ghetto is liberty.

664
00:48:50,563 --> 00:48:52,929
This street
divides the ghetto just about in half.

665
00:48:54,195 --> 00:48:55,966
Right side: Ghetto A

666
00:48:57,149 --> 00:48:58,302
civil employees

667
00:48:59,081 --> 00:49:00,828
industrial workers, and so on.

668
00:49:02,049 --> 00:49:03,873
Left side: Ghetto B

669
00:49:05,107 --> 00:49:06,259
surplus labour

670
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:09,052
the elderly and infirm mostly

671
00:49:09,362 --> 00:49:11,337
which is where you will want to start.

672
00:49:11,873 --> 00:49:13,312
Do you have any questions, sir?

673
00:49:14,041 --> 00:49:16,418
Yeah.
Why is the top down? I'm fucking freezing.

674
00:49:19,241 --> 00:49:21,686
We expect a labour force of 25,000 to 30,000

675
00:49:22,024 --> 00:49:23,103
segregated, of course:

676
00:49:23,489 --> 00:49:25,268
the men in the barracks near the quarry

677
00:49:25,328 --> 00:49:26,449
the women on the other side of the wire.

678
00:49:26,507 --> 00:49:27,210
My place is where?

679
00:49:27,966 --> 00:49:28,605
There, sir.

680
00:49:28,802 --> 00:49:30,525
- There?
- Yes, the villa

681
00:49:30,696 --> 00:49:31,962
You call that a villa?

682
00:49:32,187 --> 00:49:33,433
Their synagogue, can you see it?

683
00:49:33,536 --> 00:49:34,320
That's not a villa.

684
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,023
We're planning
to turn it into the camp stables.

685
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:36,686
It's a house.

686
00:49:38,157 --> 00:49:39,038
What's that over there?

687
00:49:41,759 --> 00:49:43,455
- A kindergarten.
- Fifty-one

688
00:49:44,373 --> 00:49:48,145
And we have a dentist,
a shoemaker, practical physicians4

689
00:49:51,252 --> 00:49:52,399
There they are, sir.

690
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,038
Hmm

691
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:00,659
One of you is a very lucky girl.

692
00:50:01,945 --> 00:50:02,705
There is

693
00:50:03,152 --> 00:50:04,645
an opening for a job

694
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,641
away from all this

695
00:50:07,183 --> 00:50:08,311
backbreaking work

696
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:10,594
at my new villa.

697
00:50:12,862 --> 00:50:13,447
Uh

698
00:50:16,223 --> 00:50:19,085
Which of you has domestic experience?

699
00:50:23,083 --> 00:50:26,333
Yeah. On second thought,
I don't really want someone else's maid:

700
00:50:27,013 --> 00:50:29,223
All those annoying habits I'd have to undo!

701
00:50:35,072 --> 00:50:36,413
I don't want to give you my cold.

702
00:50:38,027 --> 00:50:38,826
What's your name?

703
00:50:40,076 --> 00:50:41,366
- Helen Hirsch
- What?

704
00:50:42,311 --> 00:50:43,293
Helen Hirsch

705
00:50:44,005 --> 00:50:44,846
What? I can't hear.

706
00:50:45,947 --> 00:50:47,052
Helen Hirsch

707
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:03,860
Yeah

708
00:51:04,196 --> 00:51:05,473
Take it all down.

709
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:07,746
To work.

710
00:51:10,665 --> 00:51:12,284
Take it down. It is not safe.

711
00:51:12,344 --> 00:51:15,150
She says, the foundation
was poured wrong. She's got to take it down.

712
00:51:15,275 --> 00:51:18,123
I told her it's
the barracks, not the fucking Hotel Europa.

713
00:51:18,317 --> 00:51:21,976
Fucking
jew bitch engineer! You fucking bitch!

714
00:51:22,355 --> 00:51:23,563
Herr Kommandant

715
00:51:24,714 --> 00:51:26,288
the entire foundation

716
00:51:26,567 --> 00:51:29,080
has to be torn down and re-poured.

717
00:51:29,268 --> 00:51:32,525
If not, there will be at least a subsidence

718
00:51:32,967 --> 00:51:34,482
at the southern end of the barracks:

719
00:51:35,166 --> 00:51:36,121
subsidence

720
00:51:36,609 --> 00:51:37,721
and then collapse.

721
00:51:37,793 --> 00:51:39,714
- And you are an engineer?
- Yes

722
00:51:40,513 --> 00:51:41,877
My name is Diana Reiter.

723
00:51:41,953 --> 00:51:45,237
I'm a graduate of civil engineering
from the University of Milan.

724
00:51:45,313 --> 00:51:48,534
An educated jew, like Karl Marx himself!

725
00:51:56,753 --> 00:51:58,359
- Unterscharfuhrer
- Yes?

726
00:52:00,234 --> 00:52:01,027
Shoot her.

727
00:52:01,726 --> 00:52:02,475
What?

728
00:52:04,272 --> 00:52:05,270
Herr Kommandant

729
00:52:06,274 --> 00:52:08,355
I'm only trying to do my job.

730
00:52:08,435 --> 00:52:09,413
Yeah and I'm doing mine.

731
00:52:09,995 --> 00:52:11,701
But sir, she's foreman of construction.

732
00:52:12,411 --> 00:52:14,480
We are not
going to have arguments with these people.

733
00:52:15,301 --> 00:52:15,851
OK

734
00:52:18,224 --> 00:52:20,764
No. Shoot her here, on my authority.

735
00:52:32,328 --> 00:52:33,962
It will take more than that.

736
00:52:34,306 --> 00:52:35,322
I'm sure you're right.

737
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:44,957
Take it down, re-pour it

738
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:46,170
rebuild it

739
00:52:46,431 --> 00:52:47,502
like she said.

740
00:52:48,181 --> 00:52:50,797
We have more to see
but we have only one more hour of light.

741
00:53:02,672 --> 00:53:04,348
Today is history.

742
00:53:06,272 --> 00:53:08,759
Today will be remembered.

743
00:53:10,674 --> 00:53:11,971
Years from now

744
00:53:13,007 --> 00:53:16,101
the young
will ask with wonder about this day.

745
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:20,221
Today is history and you are part of it.

746
00:53:23,031 --> 00:53:24,824
Six hundred years ago

747
00:53:25,451 --> 00:53:26,556
when elsewhere they were

748
00:53:26,663 --> 00:53:28,194
footing the blame for the Black Death

749
00:53:29,268 --> 00:53:30,527
Kazimierz the Great

750
00:53:31,284 --> 00:53:32,178
so-called

751
00:53:33,041 --> 00:53:35,707
told the jews, they could come to Krakow.

752
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:37,775
They came.

753
00:53:38,107 --> 00:53:38,957
Not that fat. No, less.

754
00:53:39,014 --> 00:53:41,491
They trundled their belongings into the city.

755
00:53:41,549 --> 00:53:42,416
Yes, a bit less

756
00:53:42,475 --> 00:53:43,478
They settled.

757
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:45,596
They took hold.

758
00:53:46,811 --> 00:53:47,618
They prospered

759
00:53:49,154 --> 00:53:52,246
in business, science, education, the arts...

760
00:53:53,869 --> 00:53:55,549
They came here with nothing.

761
00:53:57,636 --> 00:53:58,462
Nothing!

762
00:54:00,069 --> 00:54:01,357
...and they flourished.

763
00:54:02,828 --> 00:54:07,192
For six centuries
there has been a jewish Krakow.

764
00:54:08,708 --> 00:54:09,755
Think about that.

765
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:12,141
By this evening

766
00:54:13,195 --> 00:54:15,956
those six centuries are a rumour.

767
00:54:18,152 --> 00:54:19,161
They never happened.

768
00:54:21,533 --> 00:54:22,647
Today is history.

769
00:54:43,467 --> 00:54:47,201
Spread out and enter in two rows.

770
00:54:47,496 --> 00:54:49,503
Comrades, quickly.

771
00:54:52,413 --> 00:54:56,406
I think we will start with Ghetto B.

772
00:54:56,464 --> 00:54:58,232
<i>Hopp hopp hopp hopp</i>

773
00:55:05,864 --> 00:55:06,692
All right?

774
00:55:06,916 --> 00:55:07,962
Start from both sides?

775
00:55:08,143 --> 00:55:09,967
- No no. I would like you to start there.
- The right side?

776
00:55:10,025 --> 00:55:11,949
- The right side, yeah.
- And then move around.

777
00:55:12,007 --> 00:55:12,788
All right.

778
00:55:31,076 --> 00:55:31,996
Open.

779
00:55:33,032 --> 00:55:33,746
Get up.

780
00:55:37,056 --> 00:55:39,259
- Quite a bit
- Oh

781
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:45,882
<i>Hopp hopp hopp hopp</i>

782
00:56:26,538 --> 00:56:28,078
Come down.

783
00:56:36,062 --> 00:56:37,505
Get down, jews.

784
00:56:42,219 --> 00:56:43,087
To the square.

785
00:56:52,692 --> 00:56:54,145
Gold, Chaim

786
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:55,306
Chodi Square

787
00:56:56,337 --> 00:56:57,460
Gold, Chaim

788
00:56:57,929 --> 00:56:59,096
Yes, Chaim Gold

789
00:56:59,321 --> 00:57:00,065
Shoot him.

790
00:57:06,554 --> 00:57:08,797
Do not kill. Do not kill.

791
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:11,581
Put warm clothes on

792
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:13,163
and go to the square.

793
00:57:13,398 --> 00:57:16,321
No suitcases, no suitcases

794
00:57:16,773 --> 00:57:17,643
Walk through.

795
00:57:17,701 --> 00:57:19,949
No suitcases, no suitcases

796
00:57:20,341 --> 00:57:22,636
Hey, little boy. How old are you, eh?

797
00:57:22,696 --> 00:57:23,282
What's your name?

798
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:25,094
What's your name, eh?

799
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:28,370
No suitcases, I said.

800
00:57:29,281 --> 00:57:30,462
Do not pack suitcases. No suitcases

801
00:57:31,788 --> 00:57:33,261
Go to Chodi Square.

802
00:57:33,511 --> 00:57:34,618
Leave your suitcases here.

803
00:57:34,676 --> 00:57:37,272
Blue card: Chodi Square

804
00:57:37,636 --> 00:57:39,241
What is this suitcase for?

805
00:57:39,621 --> 00:57:41,382
They all go to Chodi Square.

806
00:57:58,333 --> 00:57:59,784
We're getting out through the sewers.

807
00:57:59,842 --> 00:58:01,119
I have to check if they're clear.

808
00:58:02,549 --> 00:58:04,429
Mila,
pack some things: nothing bigger than this.

809
00:58:04,487 --> 00:58:07,179
I can't go in the sewers.
I told you, I won't go in the sewers.

810
00:58:11,498 --> 00:58:12,404
You can go.

811
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:14,239
Yes, you can.

812
00:58:17,206 --> 00:58:18,561
I won't go in the sewers.

813
00:58:29,826 --> 00:58:32,991
Move. Over there. Over there. Move.

814
00:58:33,538 --> 00:58:35,056
Your card, jew

815
00:58:35,958 --> 00:58:37,449
No papers, jew

816
00:58:38,408 --> 00:58:40,109
No papers, jew

817
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:43,054
That line

818
00:58:44,732 --> 00:58:45,871
Your card

819
00:58:45,931 --> 00:58:47,212
I am not going up

820
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:49,192
because of your damn card

821
00:58:50,599 --> 00:58:52,670
your shit card.

822
00:59:11,186 --> 00:59:12,074
What is this shit?

823
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:13,297
Have you gone crazy?

824
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:14,226
With this gun

825
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:15,741
you could have killed me.

826
00:59:15,799 --> 00:59:17,797
You were so close to me.

827
00:59:18,549 --> 00:59:19,485
What is the excuse here?

828
00:59:19,545 --> 00:59:20,516
You must be crazy.

829
00:59:20,784 --> 00:59:22,166
Stay back. Stay back.

830
00:59:27,694 --> 00:59:29,167
Do not speak. Do not speak.

831
00:59:29,225 --> 00:59:30,670
Just go to the trucks.

832
00:59:31,438 --> 00:59:32,080
Continue running.

833
00:59:32,139 --> 00:59:34,058
Continue running. Do not speak.

834
00:59:43,572 --> 00:59:45,344
Come here, you jewish pig.

835
00:59:45,743 --> 00:59:47,543
Stay still, I said. Stay still.

836
00:59:53,453 --> 00:59:54,868
Walk here fast.

837
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,972
She's as good as dead. Leave her.

838
01:00:45,863 --> 01:00:48,450
Give me
a moment. Just let me bring her inside.

839
01:00:54,189 --> 01:00:55,104
You can join her

840
01:00:56,309 --> 01:00:57,320
or join the line.

841
01:01:02,329 --> 01:01:03,385
Women to the left.

842
01:01:03,445 --> 01:01:04,271
- Wilhelm
- Rose

843
01:01:04,501 --> 01:01:06,653
Men to right. Women to the left.

844
01:01:07,448 --> 01:01:08,104
Women to the left.

845
01:01:08,182 --> 01:01:10,421
Let me go. I won't leave my husband.

846
01:01:14,809 --> 01:01:15,466
Women to the left

847
01:01:15,543 --> 01:01:16,260
Promise me. Be safe.

848
01:01:16,554 --> 01:01:17,961
and men to the right.

849
01:01:20,579 --> 01:01:22,467
Your government is in the wrong country.

850
01:01:29,168 --> 01:01:30,651
Mama Mama

851
01:02:17,037 --> 01:02:17,702
Mila

852
01:02:50,758 --> 01:02:52,396
You have a blue card.

853
01:02:52,454 --> 01:02:53,642
A blue card doesn't matter anymore.

854
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:55,048
They are cleaning out the ghetto.

855
01:02:55,124 --> 01:02:56,608
There is not enough room for you.

856
01:02:56,666 --> 01:02:57,680
What are you talking about?

857
01:02:57,738 --> 01:02:59,968
We tried it before.
There's more than enough room.

858
01:03:00,407 --> 01:03:02,139
I changed my mind.

859
01:03:02,197 --> 01:03:03,066
Mama

860
01:03:03,124 --> 01:03:05,229
Oh look at the space in there.

861
01:03:05,287 --> 01:03:07,448
Now look at me. You are just scared.

862
01:03:07,506 --> 01:03:09,626
I can fit the girl but not you.

863
01:03:09,684 --> 01:03:11,057
Mama, I'm coming out.

864
01:03:11,249 --> 01:03:12,068
Stay where you are.

865
01:03:12,126 --> 01:03:14,124
I'd rather you be here than who-knows-where.

866
01:03:14,204 --> 01:03:15,171
Mama

867
01:03:35,854 --> 01:03:37,178
Herr Kommandant

868
01:03:38,162 --> 01:03:39,258
Very good saluting.

869
01:03:39,682 --> 01:03:41,698
I respectfully report,
I've been given orders

870
01:03:41,758 --> 01:03:43,044
to clear the bundles from the road

871
01:03:43,562 --> 01:03:45,892
so there will be
no obstructions to the thoroughfare.

872
01:03:46,562 --> 01:03:48,941
Finish and join the lines, little Polish

873
01:03:49,307 --> 01:03:51,046
clicking soldier.

874
01:04:13,361 --> 01:04:14,419
Mrs. Dresner?

875
01:04:14,729 --> 01:04:15,476
Yes

876
01:04:16,479 --> 01:04:18,564
Oh you are a friend of my son's.

877
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:21,124
Don't worry.
I'll go quietly. I'll be no trouble.

878
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,876
No. Get under the stairs.

879
01:04:22,947 --> 01:04:25,483
They'll be done
searching soon. You'll be safe there.

880
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:27,043
Please hide. Please

881
01:04:27,159 --> 01:04:28,265
warmed by the sun.

882
01:04:28,718 --> 01:04:30,229
Hide under the stairs.

883
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,057
I've
searched the building. There's no one here.

884
01:04:36,519 --> 01:04:38,724
So then, let's go to the next block.

885
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:39,999
Agreed.

886
01:04:46,119 --> 01:04:47,499
- Danka
- Mama

887
01:04:53,841 --> 01:04:54,704
Hello, Adam

888
01:04:56,465 --> 01:04:57,662
Hello, Danka

889
01:05:03,878 --> 01:05:06,135
Come with me.
I will put you in the good line.

890
01:05:09,334 --> 01:05:12,084
Do you know
the saying, "An hour of life is still life?"

891
01:05:12,396 --> 01:05:15,963
You are not
a boy anymore. I'm saying a blessing for you.

892
01:06:50,033 --> 01:06:52,717
Oh please, let's go. Let's go, please.

893
01:06:53,872 --> 01:06:54,508
Come on.

894
01:08:01,043 --> 01:08:01,896
Mark here.

895
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:03,648
Mark here.

896
01:08:55,028 --> 01:08:56,409
No. Please, sir

897
01:09:02,465 --> 01:09:04,143
we won't find it.

898
01:09:28,349 --> 01:09:31,201
What's that? Is it Bach?

899
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:32,287
No no. Mozart

900
01:09:32,503 --> 01:09:33,626
- Mozart?
- Yes

901
01:09:53,612 --> 01:09:54,669
Are we going to do that too today?

902
01:09:54,785 --> 01:09:55,790
No. We're never doing that.

903
01:10:01,384 --> 01:10:03,108
No. We're never doing that.

904
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:05,155
I wish this fucking night were over.

905
01:10:42,611 --> 01:10:44,695
Roll call. Rows of five.

906
01:10:46,753 --> 01:10:47,713
Line up.

907
01:10:50,582 --> 01:10:52,821
Stop. Everbody, stop.

908
01:10:55,515 --> 01:10:57,790
Go on. Go on. Rows of five.

909
01:10:59,156 --> 01:11:00,563
Hats off.

910
01:11:02,713 --> 01:11:04,241
Read the names.

911
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:06,224
Whoever is called will raise his hand

912
01:11:06,313 --> 01:11:08,670
with a clear "yes".

913
01:11:08,729 --> 01:11:09,473
Yes

914
01:11:13,981 --> 01:11:15,901
- Keller, Fanni
- Yes

915
01:11:17,179 --> 01:11:21,108
- Adalbert, Hermann
- Yes

916
01:11:21,736 --> 01:11:23,629
- Faber, Dorothea
- Yes

917
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:25,955
- Goldstein, Pola
- Yes

918
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:30,482
- Warmberger, Markus
- Yes

919
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:34,063
Edelstein, Max

920
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,640
Roll call over.

921
01:11:54,311 --> 01:11:55,271
To work.

922
01:11:56,138 --> 01:11:58,505
The worst is over. We are workers now.

923
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,360
Do not pretend to be tired.

924
01:12:36,458 --> 01:12:39,743
Oh God, Amon

925
01:12:44,296 --> 01:12:46,571
Return to the barracks immediately.

926
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:31,742
Come here a minute. Come on here.

927
01:13:31,895 --> 01:13:33,247
Come now. Come now.

928
01:13:37,015 --> 01:13:39,951
Amon, you're such a damned fucking child.

929
01:13:40,175 --> 01:13:41,183
Wakey wakey

930
01:13:51,659 --> 01:13:52,618
Make coffee.

931
01:13:53,091 --> 01:13:54,291
Make it yourself.

932
01:14:09,694 --> 01:14:12,062
The SS will manage certain industries itself

933
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:13,196
inside Plaszow:

934
01:14:13,974 --> 01:14:16,019
a metalworks, brush factory

935
01:14:16,372 --> 01:14:18,756
another for reprocessing jewish clothing

936
01:14:18,814 --> 01:14:22,091
from the ghettos
for use by bombed-out families back home.

937
01:14:22,314 --> 01:14:25,658
But it's private industry
like yours that stands to benefit most

938
01:14:25,733 --> 01:14:27,846
by moving inside the wire
of Commandant Amon Goeth's camp.

939
01:14:27,906 --> 01:14:30,372
No no no. Sit sit. Julian, how are you?

940
01:14:30,453 --> 01:14:31,725
Good to see you, my friend.

941
01:14:31,822 --> 01:14:33,613
- Oskar Schindler
- Leo, John

942
01:14:38,813 --> 01:14:39,827
Franz, good to see you.

943
01:14:39,886 --> 01:14:41,175
Hello, Oskar. Glad you could join us.

944
01:14:41,233 --> 01:14:42,266
My pleasure. My pleasure.

945
01:14:42,353 --> 01:14:44,474
- Julius. How are you? Good good.
- You've lost weight.

946
01:14:44,532 --> 01:14:47,252
Only in the shoulders.
Please, everybody, sit down. Sit down.

947
01:14:48,652 --> 01:14:50,328
How are you doing? Oskar Schindler.

948
01:14:52,870 --> 01:14:53,930
We started without you.

949
01:14:54,188 --> 01:14:55,918
Fine. Did I Miss anything good?

950
01:14:56,689 --> 01:14:59,278
I was
explaining to Herr Bosch and Herr Madritsch

951
01:14:59,336 --> 01:15:02,059
some of the benefits
of moving their factories into Plaszow.

952
01:15:02,131 --> 01:15:03,101
I meant the food.

953
01:15:06,770 --> 01:15:08,616
Since your labour is housed on-site

954
01:15:08,706 --> 01:15:10,380
it's available to you at all times.

955
01:15:10,689 --> 01:15:12,585
You can work them all night if you want.

956
01:15:13,331 --> 01:15:14,788
Your factory policies

957
01:15:14,853 --> 01:15:17,346
whatever they've been
in the past, they'll continue to be.

958
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:19,103
They'll be respected.

959
01:15:19,955 --> 01:15:21,993
I have to know:
Where do you get a suit like that?

960
01:15:22,342 --> 01:15:23,791
What is that? Is that silk?

961
01:15:23,918 --> 01:15:24,680
Of course

962
01:15:26,314 --> 01:15:26,902
Yes

963
01:15:27,849 --> 01:15:29,193
It has a nice sheen about it.

964
01:15:30,073 --> 01:15:30,688
Thank you.

965
01:15:30,969 --> 01:15:31,706
Very nice.

966
01:15:32,210 --> 01:15:34,684
I'd say I'd get you one,
but the man who made it is probably dead.

967
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:36,247
I don't know.

968
01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:40,112
I go to work the other day.

969
01:15:41,654 --> 01:15:42,639
Nobody's there.

970
01:15:43,788 --> 01:15:47,269
Nobody tells me about this.
I have to find out. I have to go in.

971
01:15:48,474 --> 01:15:49,609
Everybody's gone.

972
01:15:50,728 --> 01:15:51,363
No

973
01:15:53,608 --> 01:15:54,171
No

974
01:15:58,328 --> 01:15:59,407
They're not gone.

975
01:16:00,072 --> 01:16:00,694
They're here.

976
01:16:00,766 --> 01:16:01,768
They're mine.

977
01:16:04,523 --> 01:16:05,967
Every day that goes by, I'm losing money.

978
01:16:06,027 --> 01:16:07,764
Every worker that is shot costs me money.

979
01:16:07,822 --> 01:16:09,525
I have to find
somebody else. I have to train them.

980
01:16:09,585 --> 01:16:11,211
We are going to be making so much money

981
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:12,278
that none of this is going to matter.

982
01:16:12,336 --> 01:16:13,693
It's bad business.

983
01:16:26,645 --> 01:16:27,560
Thank you.

984
01:16:28,518 --> 01:16:29,246
Leave the bottle.

985
01:16:31,765 --> 01:16:32,385
Take that.

986
01:16:34,349 --> 01:16:35,005
Lena

987
01:16:36,346 --> 01:16:37,001
thank you.

988
01:16:46,444 --> 01:16:48,513
Scherner told me something else about you.

989
01:16:51,524 --> 01:16:52,862
Yeah? What's that?

990
01:16:53,911 --> 01:16:55,823
That you know the meaning of the word

991
01:16:56,476 --> 01:16:57,327
"gratitude".

992
01:16:59,045 --> 01:17:01,809
...that it's not some vague thing with you

993
01:17:01,888 --> 01:17:03,987
like it is with others.

994
01:17:05,487 --> 01:17:07,376
You want to stay where you are.

995
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:10,801
You've got things going on the side.

996
01:17:11,689 --> 01:17:12,759
Things are good.

997
01:17:13,725 --> 01:17:16,875
You
don't want anybody telling you what to do.

998
01:17:18,006 --> 01:17:19,894
I can understand all that, you know.

999
01:17:20,634 --> 01:17:21,353
I know you.

1000
01:17:24,286 --> 01:17:25,205
What you want

1001
01:17:26,381 --> 01:17:28,465
is your own sub-camp.

1002
01:17:34,645 --> 01:17:36,358
Do you have any idea what is involved?

1003
01:17:37,113 --> 01:17:39,515
The paperwork alone! ...and
then you've got to build the fucking thing.

1004
01:17:39,573 --> 01:17:41,849
Getting the fucking
permits is enough to drive you crazy.

1005
01:17:42,005 --> 01:17:43,085
Then the engineers show up.

1006
01:17:43,144 --> 01:17:45,724
They stand around.
They argue about drainage, foundations

1007
01:17:45,823 --> 01:17:47,439
codes, exact specifications

1008
01:17:47,524 --> 01:17:49,247
parallel fences four kilometres long

1009
01:17:49,363 --> 01:17:51,068
1,200 kilograms of barbed wire

1010
01:17:51,259 --> 01:17:54,350
6,000 kilograms
of electrified fences, ceramic insulators

1011
01:17:54,443 --> 01:17:56,207
three cubic meters
of air space per prisoner...

1012
01:17:56,266 --> 01:17:57,582
I'm telling you, you want to shoot somebody.

1013
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:59,247
I've been through it, you know? I know.

1014
01:17:59,934 --> 01:18:01,400
Well, you know. You've been through it.

1015
01:18:05,644 --> 01:18:07,345
You could make things easier for me.

1016
01:18:11,362 --> 01:18:12,415
I'd be grateful.

1017
01:18:17,337 --> 01:18:18,368
Out of the way there.

1018
01:18:28,198 --> 01:18:30,108
Keep moving. Keep moving.

1019
01:18:47,242 --> 01:18:48,064
Where's Stern?

1020
01:18:52,523 --> 01:18:53,908
Goldberg and Chilowicz

1021
01:18:54,693 --> 01:18:56,569
make sure I see my cut

1022
01:18:56,641 --> 01:18:59,430
from the factory owners in this camp.

1023
01:19:00,025 --> 01:19:02,997
I'm
leaving you to take care of my main account:

1024
01:19:03,322 --> 01:19:05,688
the Schindler account.

1025
01:19:06,601 --> 01:19:07,979
He wants his independence.

1026
01:19:08,724 --> 01:19:09,671
I gave it to him.

1027
01:19:10,654 --> 01:19:12,375
But independence costs money.

1028
01:19:13,545 --> 01:19:14,716
This, you understand?

1029
01:19:20,595 --> 01:19:21,354
Look at me.

1030
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:34,937
Don't forget who you are working for now.

1031
01:19:44,397 --> 01:19:45,112
Yes, sir

1032
01:19:45,479 --> 01:19:47,622
Make sure he stays. He's a slippery bastard.

1033
01:19:55,479 --> 01:19:56,604
We need more wine.

1034
01:19:56,662 --> 01:19:57,312
More wine.

1035
01:19:58,009 --> 01:20:00,002
Stand on my friend. Don't let him leave.

1036
01:20:16,029 --> 01:20:18,349
What happens in my life

1037
01:20:18,407 --> 01:20:19,242
Cheers cheers

1038
01:20:22,956 --> 01:20:24,411
Thank you, Herr Direktor.

1039
01:20:24,469 --> 01:20:25,443
Cheers, Herr Direktor

1040
01:20:30,555 --> 01:20:31,394
What are you doing?

1041
01:20:31,813 --> 01:20:33,310
What? Scratching my head.

1042
01:20:34,117 --> 01:20:36,921
It makes them think we have lice.
It helps make them keep their distance.

1043
01:20:38,595 --> 01:20:40,121
- Do you have lice?
- Do you have your notebook?

1044
01:20:40,756 --> 01:20:42,555
The calendar on my desk has the birthdays

1045
01:20:42,616 --> 01:20:44,202
of our SS friends' wives and children.

1046
01:20:44,515 --> 01:20:45,879
Don't forget to send something.

1047
01:20:46,961 --> 01:20:48,756
Record pay-offs to the Main Administration

1048
01:20:48,814 --> 01:20:50,399
and Economics Office, the Arm...

1049
01:20:50,458 --> 01:20:51,563
Slowly, Stern. Slowly.

1050
01:20:51,635 --> 01:20:54,643
The Armaments Board,
Governor General's Division of the Interior

1051
01:20:54,701 --> 01:20:56,773
and Chief of Police as "fees"

1052
01:20:56,995 --> 01:20:59,078
and make them on the first of each month

1053
01:20:59,154 --> 01:21:01,555
as opposed to
individual pay-offs to our SS contacts.

1054
01:21:01,635 --> 01:21:03,738
The list is in
the lower drawer of my desk, which you

1055
01:21:03,796 --> 01:21:05,474
"...first of month."

1056
01:21:06,675 --> 01:21:09,178
...SS contacts list,
lower drawer of my desk, which you handle

1057
01:21:09,235 --> 01:21:11,340
as cash contributions
to legitimate charities

1058
01:21:11,398 --> 01:21:13,180
sent, of course, to each official's office.

1059
01:21:13,514 --> 01:21:15,836
Dealings with our black market contacts

1060
01:21:15,894 --> 01:21:18,358
listed as
"suppliers" in the legitimate ledger

1061
01:21:18,416 --> 01:21:19,881
- are more complicated.
- Forget it.

1062
01:21:19,976 --> 01:21:21,096
What do you mean,
forget it? You can't forget it.

1063
01:21:21,154 --> 01:21:23,041
It
gives me a headache. It gives me a headache.

1064
01:21:30,592 --> 01:21:32,068
- I couldn't get you out of here.
- I'll be all right.

1065
01:21:33,793 --> 01:21:35,952
Anyway I'm here almost every week:

1066
01:21:36,969 --> 01:21:37,915
Wednesdays usually.

1067
01:21:38,434 --> 01:21:39,497
I'll look in on you

1068
01:21:39,629 --> 01:21:40,496
and see how you're doing.

1069
01:21:43,233 --> 01:21:43,877
Here.

1070
01:21:45,013 --> 01:21:45,868
Put these in your pocket.

1071
01:21:46,781 --> 01:21:47,368
Come on.

1072
01:21:52,752 --> 01:21:54,433
Herr Direktor, don't let things fall apart.

1073
01:21:54,492 --> 01:21:55,528
I've worked too hard.

1074
01:22:04,833 --> 01:22:05,752
Thanks for...

1075
01:22:07,485 --> 01:22:08,170
Good luck

1076
01:22:29,947 --> 01:22:32,205
Attention. Hats off.

1077
01:22:41,988 --> 01:22:43,550
- Work.
- Get to work.

1078
01:22:57,991 --> 01:22:59,034
What are you making?

1079
01:22:59,653 --> 01:23:00,413
Hinges, sir.

1080
01:23:04,577 --> 01:23:06,781
I've got some workers coming in tomorrow.

1081
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:07,997
Where the hell are they from again?

1082
01:23:08,069 --> 01:23:09,336
Yugoslavia, Herr Kommandant.

1083
01:23:10,125 --> 01:23:11,398
I've got to make room.

1084
01:23:14,751 --> 01:23:16,384
Make me a hinge.

1085
01:23:16,921 --> 01:23:17,711
Yes, sir

1086
01:23:48,708 --> 01:23:49,983
Keep going. You're doing well.

1087
01:23:59,618 --> 01:24:01,167
Oh that's very good

1088
01:24:02,347 --> 01:24:05,530
but I'm
a bit confused, and perhaps you can help me.

1089
01:24:06,078 --> 01:24:07,918
What I don't understand is

1090
01:24:08,472 --> 01:24:09,569
that you've been working

1091
01:24:09,627 --> 01:24:11,229
since I think... what? about

1092
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:13,095
6:00 this morning?

1093
01:24:14,467 --> 01:24:15,064
Yet

1094
01:24:15,867 --> 01:24:18,573
such a small pile of hinges.

1095
01:24:47,355 --> 01:24:49,035
- Oh Christ
- May I try that, sir?

1096
01:24:49,626 --> 01:24:51,306
Check the angle lever. Maybe it's bent.

1097
01:24:51,511 --> 01:24:54,636
No no. You wouldn't
hear a click if the angle lever hits the pin.

1098
01:24:54,938 --> 01:24:56,838
Maybe
it's the pin. Maybe the pin shaft is greasy.

1099
01:24:56,898 --> 01:24:57,453
Yeah, come on.

1100
01:24:57,511 --> 01:24:58,707
What did I just say? Here.

1101
01:25:03,305 --> 01:25:04,419
Herr Kommandant

1102
01:25:04,746 --> 01:25:07,440
I beg to report that my heap of hinges

1103
01:25:07,965 --> 01:25:09,736
was so unsatisfactory

1104
01:25:10,343 --> 01:25:11,748
because the machines

1105
01:25:11,901 --> 01:25:13,967
were being recalibrated this morning.

1106
01:25:15,881 --> 01:25:18,466
I was put on to shovelling coal.

1107
01:25:41,542 --> 01:25:42,323
Strange, huh?

1108
01:25:43,765 --> 01:25:44,392
Yeah

1109
01:25:49,943 --> 01:25:50,889
Thank you, Muek.

1110
01:25:53,301 --> 01:25:54,172
Ah Lisiek

1111
01:25:54,623 --> 01:25:56,485
don't touch
the leather. It's just been oiled.

1112
01:25:56,861 --> 01:25:58,468
- Rottenfuhrer
- Oh for me?

1113
01:25:58,528 --> 01:25:59,954
Oh thank you very much, Herr Direktor.

1114
01:26:00,014 --> 01:26:01,021
Herr Direktor

1115
01:26:02,679 --> 01:26:03,760
Herr Direktor

1116
01:26:07,227 --> 01:26:08,092
Herr Direktor

1117
01:26:11,381 --> 01:26:12,744
He was making hinges slowly.

1118
01:26:12,820 --> 01:26:14,292
So the man can turn out a hinge in

1119
01:26:14,350 --> 01:26:16,238
less than a minute. Why the long story?

1120
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:17,725
Hmm?

1121
01:26:45,297 --> 01:26:46,364
Thank you, sir

1122
01:26:46,765 --> 01:26:47,560
You're welcome.

1123
01:26:51,498 --> 01:26:53,909
Nobody knows who stole the chicken, hmm?

1124
01:26:54,604 --> 01:26:55,306
Tell him about the chicken.

1125
01:26:55,364 --> 01:26:58,739
A man walks around
with a chicken and nobody notices this.

1126
01:26:59,780 --> 01:27:00,823
Save yourselves.

1127
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:03,547
Tell him about the chicken.

1128
01:27:19,695 --> 01:27:20,930
Still nobody knows.

1129
01:27:32,819 --> 01:27:33,653
It was you.

1130
01:27:34,957 --> 01:27:36,419
You committed this crime.

1131
01:27:36,498 --> 01:27:37,122
No, sir

1132
01:27:37,181 --> 01:27:38,260
But you know who, though.

1133
01:27:38,914 --> 01:27:40,171
- Yes
- Who?

1134
01:27:42,039 --> 01:27:42,843
Him.

1135
01:27:47,904 --> 01:27:48,685
He's very gifted.

1136
01:27:48,743 --> 01:27:50,417
Yeah, sure. Bring him over.

1137
01:27:54,097 --> 01:27:54,702
Sir

1138
01:27:56,761 --> 01:27:57,731
thank you.

1139
01:28:03,493 --> 01:28:04,813
Thank you again, Herr Direktor.

1140
01:28:04,913 --> 01:28:06,069
You're welcome again.

1141
01:28:06,331 --> 01:28:08,657
It's
an honour to work for such a great company.

1142
01:28:08,736 --> 01:28:09,697
It's great to have you.

1143
01:28:09,775 --> 01:28:13,350
I promise to learn everything
there is to know about enamelware production.

1144
01:28:13,408 --> 01:28:14,155
That's great.

1145
01:28:25,895 --> 01:28:26,818
Hello?

1146
01:28:27,997 --> 01:28:29,583
- Miss Elsa Krause is here.
- I only need five minutes.

1147
01:28:29,654 --> 01:28:31,117
She wants to speak to the Herr Direktor.

1148
01:28:52,014 --> 01:28:52,584
Yes

1149
01:28:57,702 --> 01:28:58,901
He won't see you.

1150
01:29:28,976 --> 01:29:30,171
Please, sit down.

1151
01:29:34,176 --> 01:29:35,164
Pernod? Cognac?

1152
01:29:35,381 --> 01:29:36,927
No. No, thank you.

1153
01:29:38,164 --> 01:29:40,314
So what can I do for you?

1154
01:29:45,655 --> 01:29:47,194
They say that no one dies here.

1155
01:29:48,207 --> 01:29:49,856
They say your factory is a haven.

1156
01:29:52,932 --> 01:29:54,043
They say you are good.

1157
01:29:57,972 --> 01:29:58,780
Who says that?

1158
01:30:00,238 --> 01:30:01,025
Everyone.

1159
01:30:08,414 --> 01:30:10,757
My name is Regina Perlman, not Elsa Krause.

1160
01:30:11,007 --> 01:30:13,930
I've been living in Krakow
on false papers since the ghetto massacre.

1161
01:30:14,333 --> 01:30:15,829
My parents are in Plaszow.

1162
01:30:16,293 --> 01:30:20,119
Their names are Chana and Jakob Perlman.

1163
01:30:20,493 --> 01:30:21,601
They are older people.

1164
01:30:21,829 --> 01:30:23,972
They are killing older people now in Plaszow.

1165
01:30:24,052 --> 01:30:26,213
They bury them up in the forest. Look.

1166
01:30:28,615 --> 01:30:29,739
I don't have any money.

1167
01:30:30,851 --> 01:30:33,404
I borrowed these clothes.

1168
01:30:36,489 --> 01:30:37,516
I'm begging you.

1169
01:30:38,471 --> 01:30:39,070
Please

1170
01:30:40,489 --> 01:30:41,690
Please bring them here.

1171
01:30:42,052 --> 01:30:43,280
I don't do that.

1172
01:30:44,610 --> 01:30:45,744
You've been misled.

1173
01:30:46,990 --> 01:30:48,043
I ask one thing:

1174
01:30:48,252 --> 01:30:50,019
whether or not the worker has certain skills.

1175
01:30:50,186 --> 01:30:51,623
That's
what I ask and that's what I care about.

1176
01:30:51,681 --> 01:30:53,825
My father is an importer, not a metalworker.

1177
01:30:53,970 --> 01:30:57,275
Such activities
are illegal. You will not entrap me.

1178
01:30:58,850 --> 01:31:00,597
Cry and I will have you arrested

1179
01:31:00,761 --> 01:31:01,815
I swear to God.

1180
01:31:11,570 --> 01:31:13,792
People die. It's a fact of life.

1181
01:31:14,364 --> 01:31:16,200
He wants to kill everybody? Great.

1182
01:31:16,261 --> 01:31:17,744
What am I supposed to do about it?

1183
01:31:18,007 --> 01:31:20,409
Bring everybody over? Is that what you think?

1184
01:31:20,729 --> 01:31:23,457
"Send them
over to Schindler. Send them all."

1185
01:31:23,592 --> 01:31:27,320
"His place is a haven,
didn't you know? It's not a factory."

1186
01:31:27,381 --> 01:31:29,337
"It's not an enterprise of any kind."

1187
01:31:29,409 --> 01:31:32,137
"It's a haven for rabbis and orphans

1188
01:31:32,208 --> 01:31:34,497
"and people with no skills whatsoever."

1189
01:31:37,766 --> 01:31:39,399
Do you think I don't know what you're doing?

1190
01:31:40,155 --> 01:31:42,155
You're so quiet all the time.

1191
01:31:42,226 --> 01:31:43,427
I know. I know.

1192
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:44,989
- Are you losing money?
- No. I'm not losing money.

1193
01:31:45,048 --> 01:31:45,851
That's not the point.

1194
01:31:45,927 --> 01:31:46,470
So the point is...

1195
01:31:46,529 --> 01:31:49,445
It's dangerous. It's dangerous to me.

1196
01:31:53,914 --> 01:31:57,244
You have to understand.
Goeth is under enormous pressure.

1197
01:31:57,369 --> 01:31:59,231
You have to think of it in his situation.

1198
01:32:01,168 --> 01:32:02,748
He's got this whole place to run.

1199
01:32:03,448 --> 01:32:06,176
He's responsible
for everything here, all these people.

1200
01:32:06,248 --> 01:32:07,823
He's got a lot of things to worry about

1201
01:32:09,756 --> 01:32:11,248
and he's got the war

1202
01:32:11,722 --> 01:32:13,292
which brings out the worst in people

1203
01:32:13,368 --> 01:32:16,450
never the good,
always the bad, always the bad

1204
01:32:18,811 --> 01:32:22,748
but in normal circumstances
he wouldn't be like this. He'd be all right.

1205
01:32:23,525 --> 01:32:26,180
There'd
just be the good aspects of him, which...

1206
01:32:27,606 --> 01:32:29,610
He's a wonderful crook

1207
01:32:30,222 --> 01:32:34,725
a man who loves good food,
good wine, the ladies, making money

1208
01:32:34,783 --> 01:32:35,338
...killing.

1209
01:32:37,051 --> 01:32:38,155
He can't enjoy it.

1210
01:32:39,726 --> 01:32:42,967
Bejski
told me, the other day somebody escaped

1211
01:32:43,097 --> 01:32:45,066
from a work detail outside the wire.

1212
01:32:45,766 --> 01:32:48,512
Goeth lined up
everybody from the missing man's barracks.

1213
01:32:49,284 --> 01:32:51,208
He shot the man to the left of Bejski

1214
01:32:51,426 --> 01:32:52,646
and the man to the right of him.

1215
01:32:52,963 --> 01:32:55,530
He walked down the line
shooting every other man with a pistol:

1216
01:33:02,177 --> 01:33:02,963
25.

1217
01:33:08,043 --> 01:33:09,386
What do you want me to do about it?

1218
01:33:09,444 --> 01:33:10,311
Nothing nothing.

1219
01:33:11,686 --> 01:33:12,556
We're just talking.

1220
01:33:25,494 --> 01:33:26,200
Perlman

1221
01:33:28,644 --> 01:33:29,887
Perlman

1222
01:33:31,569 --> 01:33:32,467
husband and wife

1223
01:33:33,244 --> 01:33:36,432
Jakob and Chana Perlman

1224
01:33:49,409 --> 01:33:50,653
Have Goldberg bring them over.

1225
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:56,066
Hats off.

1226
01:33:57,912 --> 01:33:59,797
At ease.

1227
01:34:45,489 --> 01:34:48,502
I'm sure
this will be better than those rags, Lisiek.

1228
01:34:50,012 --> 01:34:53,336
Herr Direktor,
I was just helping Lisiek to find something

1229
01:34:53,394 --> 01:34:55,860
to clean the stains
from the Herr Kommandant's bathtub.

1230
01:34:55,998 --> 01:34:56,935
Go and clean it.

1231
01:34:56,993 --> 01:34:58,280
Pardon me, Herr Direktor.

1232
01:35:02,846 --> 01:35:04,815
You don't have to report to me, Helen.

1233
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:07,238
You know who I am?

1234
01:35:08,095 --> 01:35:08,606
Hmm?

1235
01:35:16,473 --> 01:35:17,383
I'm Schindler.

1236
01:35:19,763 --> 01:35:22,044
Of course. I have heard and

1237
01:35:23,397 --> 01:35:25,151
you have been here before.

1238
01:35:28,276 --> 01:35:30,342
Here. Why don't you keep this some place?

1239
01:35:30,918 --> 01:35:32,013
Go on. Take it.

1240
01:35:32,834 --> 01:35:34,124
I get extra food here.

1241
01:35:34,183 --> 01:35:35,615
Well, if you don't want to eat it, trade it

1242
01:35:37,333 --> 01:35:38,562
or give it to Lisiek.

1243
01:35:41,276 --> 01:35:42,691
Why not build yourself up?

1244
01:35:47,967 --> 01:35:49,526
My first day here

1245
01:35:51,382 --> 01:35:54,610
he beat me
because I threw out the bones from dinner.

1246
01:35:58,770 --> 01:36:01,955
He came down
to the basement at midnight and

1247
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:04,745
he asked me where they were:

1248
01:36:08,116 --> 01:36:09,187
for his dogs

1249
01:36:10,427 --> 01:36:11,656
you understand.

1250
01:36:14,633 --> 01:36:16,155
I said to him... I

1251
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:18,360
I don't know how I say this.

1252
01:36:18,436 --> 01:36:21,423
I never could say it now. I said to him

1253
01:36:22,183 --> 01:36:23,959
"Why are you beating me?"

1254
01:36:27,745 --> 01:36:30,241
He said, "The reason I beat you now

1255
01:36:31,352 --> 01:36:34,266
"is because you ask why I beat you."

1256
01:36:36,673 --> 01:36:38,280
I know your sufferings, Helen.

1257
01:36:41,937 --> 01:36:43,049
It doesn't matter.

1258
01:36:45,833 --> 01:36:47,611
I have accepted them.

1259
01:36:48,824 --> 01:36:49,718
Accepted them?

1260
01:36:52,624 --> 01:36:54,392
One day he will shoot me.

1261
01:36:54,450 --> 01:36:56,538
No no no. He won't shoot you.

1262
01:36:57,235 --> 01:36:58,058
I know.

1263
01:36:58,660 --> 01:36:59,766
I see things.

1264
01:37:00,995 --> 01:37:02,471
We were on the roof on Monday

1265
01:37:03,102 --> 01:37:05,115
young Lisiek and I, and we saw

1266
01:37:05,481 --> 01:37:07,950
the Herr Kommandant
come out of the front door and

1267
01:37:08,526 --> 01:37:12,772
down the steps
by the patio, right there below us

1268
01:37:13,165 --> 01:37:16,772
and there
on the steps he drew his gun and he

1269
01:37:17,695 --> 01:37:19,758
shot a woman who was passing by

1270
01:37:21,794 --> 01:37:23,422
a woman carrying a bundle

1271
01:37:24,271 --> 01:37:25,026
through the throat...

1272
01:37:25,084 --> 01:37:28,790
just a woman on her way somewhere, you know?

1273
01:37:28,851 --> 01:37:29,995
She was no

1274
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:32,672
fatter or thinner or

1275
01:37:32,922 --> 01:37:34,767
slower or faster than anyone else

1276
01:37:34,825 --> 01:37:38,258
and I couldn't guess what had she done.

1277
01:37:43,141 --> 01:37:44,409
The more you see

1278
01:37:45,445 --> 01:37:48,249
of the Herr Kommandant,
the more you see there is no

1279
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:51,521
set rules that you can live by.

1280
01:37:51,674 --> 01:37:55,625
You can't say to yourself,
"If I follow these rules, I will be safe."

1281
01:37:59,632 --> 01:38:02,659
He won't
shoot you because he enjoys you too much.

1282
01:38:04,124 --> 01:38:07,195
He enjoys you
so much, he won't even let you wear the star.

1283
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:09,687
He doesn't want anyone else to know

1284
01:38:09,745 --> 01:38:11,673
it's a jew he's enjoying.

1285
01:38:15,794 --> 01:38:18,602
He shot the woman from the steps

1286
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:21,338
because she meant nothing to him.

1287
01:38:22,879 --> 01:38:24,325
She was one of a series

1288
01:38:24,383 --> 01:38:26,580
neither offending or pleasing him

1289
01:38:30,990 --> 01:38:32,468
but you, Helen...

1290
01:38:37,616 --> 01:38:38,459
It's all right.

1291
01:38:39,406 --> 01:38:40,937
It's not that kind of a kiss.

1292
01:38:47,508 --> 01:38:48,294
Thank you.

1293
01:38:48,355 --> 01:38:49,048
Shh

1294
01:38:54,620 --> 01:38:55,218
Here.

1295
01:39:01,004 --> 01:39:02,503
Right. The wine.

1296
01:39:10,388 --> 01:39:12,589
- A wonderful party, Amon.
- Thank you.

1297
01:39:21,387 --> 01:39:23,437
Why do you drink that motor oil?

1298
01:39:24,307 --> 01:39:26,370
Hmm? I send you good stuff all the time.

1299
01:39:27,535 --> 01:39:30,387
Your liver's
going to explode like a hand grenade.

1300
01:39:31,254 --> 01:39:32,339
You know, I look at you.

1301
01:39:34,111 --> 01:39:35,076
I watch you.

1302
01:39:38,946 --> 01:39:39,874
You're never drunk.

1303
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:41,637
Oh that's

1304
01:39:43,785 --> 01:39:45,075
that's real control.

1305
01:39:46,848 --> 01:39:47,995
Control is power.

1306
01:39:49,865 --> 01:39:51,093
That's power.

1307
01:39:55,705 --> 01:39:58,067
Is that why they fear us?

1308
01:40:00,807 --> 01:40:03,489
We have the fucking
power to kill, that's why they fear us.

1309
01:40:04,584 --> 01:40:07,383
They fear us because
we have the power to kill arbitrarily.

1310
01:40:08,223 --> 01:40:10,177
A man
commits a crime. He should know better.

1311
01:40:10,235 --> 01:40:12,379
We have him killed
and we feel pretty good about it

1312
01:40:13,022 --> 01:40:15,454
or we
kill him ourselves and we feel even better.

1313
01:40:17,905 --> 01:40:19,611
That's not power though.

1314
01:40:20,945 --> 01:40:22,031
That's justice.

1315
01:40:22,459 --> 01:40:23,897
It's different than power.

1316
01:40:27,665 --> 01:40:28,481
Power

1317
01:40:29,365 --> 01:40:31,727
is when we have every justification to kill

1318
01:40:32,942 --> 01:40:34,066
and we don't.

1319
01:40:35,343 --> 01:40:36,379
Do you think that's power?

1320
01:40:39,824 --> 01:40:41,333
That's what the emperors had.

1321
01:40:41,928 --> 01:40:42,910
A man stole something.

1322
01:40:42,982 --> 01:40:44,548
He's brought in before the emperor.

1323
01:40:44,607 --> 01:40:48,254
He throws himself
down on the ground. He begs for mercy.

1324
01:40:48,663 --> 01:40:50,700
He knows he's going to die.

1325
01:40:53,865 --> 01:40:54,870
And the emperor

1326
01:40:55,714 --> 01:40:56,776
pardons him.

1327
01:40:58,464 --> 01:40:59,508
This worthless man

1328
01:40:59,785 --> 01:41:00,718
he lets him go.

1329
01:41:05,031 --> 01:41:06,196
I think you are drunk.

1330
01:41:08,701 --> 01:41:10,348
That's power, Amon.

1331
01:41:11,663 --> 01:41:14,191
That is power.

1332
01:41:22,223 --> 01:41:24,491
Amon, the Good

1333
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:28,316
I pardon you.

1334
01:41:37,784 --> 01:41:38,588
What do they want?

1335
01:41:38,700 --> 01:41:42,106
I don't know but
they're in my office now reviewing our books.

1336
01:41:42,181 --> 01:41:43,217
As my accountant

1337
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:46,245
tell me:
Should I be alarmed that the auditors

1338
01:41:46,303 --> 01:41:47,883
- are reviewing my books?
- Well

1339
01:41:47,941 --> 01:41:49,401
...or have you done your job properly?

1340
01:41:49,459 --> 01:41:50,441
You needn't be alarmed.

1341
01:41:50,820 --> 01:41:51,870
I needn't be alarmed.

1342
01:41:57,092 --> 01:41:57,932
I'm sorry, sir.

1343
01:41:57,990 --> 01:41:59,263
Do you know how much this saddle is worth?

1344
01:42:00,142 --> 01:42:01,365
Do you know how much it costs?

1345
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:07,726
All right.

1346
01:42:10,660 --> 01:42:11,316
All right.

1347
01:42:15,936 --> 01:42:17,772
Stern, what the hell
are you doing following me around?

1348
01:42:28,192 --> 01:42:30,312
Barracks 1, 11

1349
01:42:30,370 --> 01:42:35,276
15 and 32 to the parade ground.

1350
01:43:04,279 --> 01:43:05,547
She was smoking on the job.

1351
01:43:09,503 --> 01:43:10,869
Tell her not to do it again.

1352
01:43:26,977 --> 01:43:28,352
I have to report, sir:

1353
01:43:30,418 --> 01:43:32,989
I've been unable
to remove the stains from your bathtub.

1354
01:43:37,736 --> 01:43:38,999
What are you using, Lisiek?

1355
01:43:39,374 --> 01:43:40,459
Soap, Commandant.

1356
01:43:43,415 --> 01:43:45,107
Soap? Not lye?

1357
01:43:54,857 --> 01:43:57,093
Go ahead. Go on. Leave leave. I pardon you.

1358
01:44:19,861 --> 01:44:20,781
I pardon you.

1359
01:46:09,048 --> 01:46:12,409
Although
I am not a rabbi, in these circumstances

1360
01:46:12,468 --> 01:46:15,075
I pray
to the Almighty that he will forgive me

1361
01:46:15,391 --> 01:46:17,531
if I intone the blessings.

1362
01:47:08,447 --> 01:47:09,112
So

1363
01:47:11,608 --> 01:47:13,991
this is where you come to hide from me.

1364
01:47:15,407 --> 01:47:16,800
I came to tell you

1365
01:47:18,789 --> 01:47:21,982
that you really are a wonderful cook

1366
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:24,139
and a well-trained servant.

1367
01:47:25,246 --> 01:47:26,072
I mean it.

1368
01:47:27,241 --> 01:47:30,013
If you need a reference after the war

1369
01:47:32,223 --> 01:47:33,432
I'd be happy to give you one.

1370
01:47:35,362 --> 01:47:37,063
It must get lonely down here

1371
01:47:37,250 --> 01:47:40,277
when you're listening
to everyone upstairs having such a good time.

1372
01:47:47,764 --> 01:47:48,416
Does it?

1373
01:47:51,727 --> 01:47:52,635
You can answer.

1374
01:47:55,807 --> 01:47:57,362
"But what's the right answer?"

1375
01:47:57,983 --> 01:47:59,030
That's what you're thinking.

1376
01:48:00,085 --> 01:48:01,451
What does he want to hear?

1377
01:48:08,005 --> 01:48:08,767
The truth

1378
01:48:09,322 --> 01:48:11,450
Helen, is always the right answer.

1379
01:48:14,786 --> 01:48:15,911
Yes, you're right.

1380
01:48:17,166 --> 01:48:18,367
Sometimes we're both lonely.

1381
01:48:20,648 --> 01:48:22,129
Yes. I...

1382
01:48:24,532 --> 01:48:25,063
I mean

1383
01:48:33,335 --> 01:48:34,933
I would like so much to

1384
01:48:36,804 --> 01:48:37,673
reach out

1385
01:48:38,871 --> 01:48:40,188
and touch you in your loneliness.

1386
01:48:41,285 --> 01:48:43,925
What would that be like, I wonder? I mean

1387
01:48:45,442 --> 01:48:46,938
What would be wrong with that?

1388
01:48:48,202 --> 01:48:49,817
I realize that you're not

1389
01:48:50,612 --> 01:48:53,710
a person
in the strictest sense of the word but

1390
01:48:56,259 --> 01:48:58,777
No. Maybe
you're right about that too, you know. Maybe

1391
01:48:59,518 --> 01:49:00,981
what's wrong isn't

1392
01:49:02,826 --> 01:49:03,666
It's not us.

1393
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:06,683
It's... No, it's this.

1394
01:49:09,844 --> 01:49:12,451
I mean, when they compare you to

1395
01:49:14,469 --> 01:49:16,844
vermin and to rodents and to lice

1396
01:49:20,723 --> 01:49:21,635
I just...

1397
01:49:25,599 --> 01:49:27,348
No. You make a good point.

1398
01:49:28,509 --> 01:49:29,804
You make a very good point.

1399
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:40,611
Is this the face of a rat?

1400
01:49:44,121 --> 01:49:46,339
Are these the eyes of a rat?

1401
01:49:49,702 --> 01:49:51,041
Hath not a jew eyes?

1402
01:49:52,599 --> 01:49:56,768
You will forgive everything

1403
01:49:57,759 --> 01:50:02,920
because my love is so sweet.

1404
01:50:07,048 --> 01:50:08,009
I feel

1405
01:50:09,504 --> 01:50:10,433
for you, Helen.

1406
01:50:14,599 --> 01:50:17,041
It's me.

1407
01:50:27,112 --> 01:50:28,116
No, I don't think so.

1408
01:50:31,273 --> 01:50:32,289
You're a jewish bitch.

1409
01:50:35,482 --> 01:50:36,978
You nearly talked me into it, didn't you?

1410
01:50:38,441 --> 01:50:39,161
Didn't you?

1411
01:50:44,635 --> 01:50:45,532
Bravo

1412
01:51:01,474 --> 01:51:05,402
High high high

1413
01:51:07,956 --> 01:51:09,277
- Bravo
- Bravo

1414
01:51:10,847 --> 01:51:13,728
High high high

1415
01:51:19,875 --> 01:51:21,933
On behalf of the workers, sir

1416
01:51:22,209 --> 01:51:25,492
I wish for you a happy birthday.

1417
01:51:26,036 --> 01:51:27,049
Happy birthday

1418
01:51:27,634 --> 01:51:29,240
Well, the staff, please

1419
01:51:29,451 --> 01:51:32,094
Thank you very much for the lovely cake.

1420
01:51:50,884 --> 01:51:54,170
Thank you
very much. Tell them, thank you from me.

1421
01:52:09,755 --> 01:52:13,566
The trains arrived 
and the people were driven out with clubs.

1422
01:52:14,264 --> 01:52:17,880
They were
lined up in front of two big warehouses.

1423
01:52:18,264 --> 01:52:21,794
One was marked,
"Cloak Room" and the other "Valuables"

1424
01:52:22,142 --> 01:52:23,594
and there they were made to undress.

1425
01:52:24,594 --> 01:52:28,768
A jewish boy handed them
pieces of string to tie their shoes together.

1426
01:52:29,593 --> 01:52:30,974
They shaved their hair.

1427
01:52:31,754 --> 01:52:32,956
They told them it was needed to

1428
01:52:33,014 --> 01:52:35,237
make something special for U-boat crews

1429
01:52:36,914 --> 01:52:38,041
and then they were

1430
01:52:38,661 --> 01:52:40,374
herded down a big corridor

1431
01:52:40,674 --> 01:52:44,308
to bunkers with stars of David on the doors

1432
01:52:44,633 --> 01:52:47,416
and
signs that said "Bath and Inhalation Room".

1433
01:52:48,576 --> 01:52:50,196
The SS gave them soap.

1434
01:52:50,526 --> 01:52:52,460
They told them to breathe all the time

1435
01:52:52,518 --> 01:52:54,121
because it's good for disinfecting

1436
01:52:56,472 --> 01:52:57,795
and then they gassed them.

1437
01:52:59,630 --> 01:53:01,683
Mila, why soaps?

1438
01:53:02,831 --> 01:53:04,429
So that they would agree to go in, I think.

1439
01:53:04,487 --> 01:53:05,576
Come on, Mila. Stop it.

1440
01:53:06,005 --> 01:53:08,192
Your bedtime stories are scaring everyone.

1441
01:53:08,271 --> 01:53:08,991
Yeah

1442
01:53:09,451 --> 01:53:10,736
You know it's ridiculous.

1443
01:53:11,231 --> 01:53:12,358
I cannot believe it.

1444
01:53:12,831 --> 01:53:15,018
I didn't say
I believed it. I said I heard it.

1445
01:53:15,349 --> 01:53:16,152
From who?

1446
01:53:16,432 --> 01:53:18,558
From somebody
who heard it from someone who was there.

1447
01:53:19,032 --> 01:53:19,683
You know

1448
01:53:20,456 --> 01:53:21,666
if they were there

1449
01:53:22,032 --> 01:53:23,481
they would have been gassed.

1450
01:53:23,817 --> 01:53:24,447
Yes

1451
01:53:25,201 --> 01:53:26,563
It doesn't make any sense.

1452
01:53:26,831 --> 01:53:28,286
We're their workforce.

1453
01:53:28,987 --> 01:53:32,072
What sense
does it make to kill your own workforce?

1454
01:53:32,590 --> 01:53:36,799
To go to all this
trouble of assembling a workforce, only to

1455
01:53:37,527 --> 01:53:38,934
No. It can't be true.

1456
01:53:40,795 --> 01:53:43,210
We are very, very important for them.

1457
01:53:43,813 --> 01:53:46,059
Yeah, we do know. Good night

1458
01:53:46,830 --> 01:53:47,481
Good night

1459
01:53:48,031 --> 01:53:49,384
Good night. Sweet dreams

1460
01:53:58,437 --> 01:54:00,120
<i>Attention attention</i>

1461
01:54:00,907 --> 01:54:02,526
<i>Everyone who is alive</i>

1462
01:54:03,509 --> 01:54:05,201
<i>is to come to the Appellplatz.</i>

1463
01:54:06,938 --> 01:54:08,126
<i>Attention, attention</i>

1464
01:54:08,723 --> 01:54:09,951
We have to go to the Appellplatz.

1465
01:54:10,009 --> 01:54:11,057
<i>Everyone who is alive</i>

1466
01:54:11,116 --> 01:54:12,161
The list makers are here.

1467
01:54:12,299 --> 01:54:13,331
<i>is to come to the Appellplatz.</i>

1468
01:54:13,389 --> 01:54:14,277
There is going to be a selection.

1469
01:54:15,102 --> 01:54:16,643
<i>Attention attention.</i>

1470
01:54:17,571 --> 01:54:19,291
<i>Everyone who is alive</i>

01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:21,830
<i>is to come to the Appellplatz.</i>

1472
01:54:37,487 --> 01:54:38,352
Gentlemen

1473
01:54:38,817 --> 01:54:39,559
- One
- Two

1474
01:54:39,692 --> 01:54:40,456
- One
- Two

1475
01:54:42,697 --> 01:54:44,268
hundreds of thousands
of Hungarians are coming.

1476
01:54:47,469 --> 01:54:50,032
Everyone, line up in a single row.

1477
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:52,826
You could afford to lose some weight, Amon

1478
01:54:54,825 --> 01:54:56,723
and you've got to cut down on the cognac.

1479
01:54:57,227 --> 01:54:57,840
Morning

1480
01:54:58,875 --> 01:54:59,751
What's going on?

1481
01:55:00,416 --> 01:55:02,585
It's another semi-annual physical.

1482
01:55:04,799 --> 01:55:05,414
There.

1483
01:55:05,826 --> 01:55:06,697
Oh I've

1484
01:55:07,468 --> 01:55:09,308
got another shipment coming in of

1485
01:55:09,558 --> 01:55:10,611
What are they this time?

1486
01:55:11,706 --> 01:55:13,294
- Hungarians.
- Yes ...hungarians.

1487
01:55:13,509 --> 01:55:16,956
We've got to separate
the sick from the healthy to make room.

1488
01:55:17,094 --> 01:55:18,896
Now now

1489
01:55:27,905 --> 01:55:32,201
<i>Good night, mother</i>

1490
01:55:32,465 --> 01:55:35,031
<i>Good night</i>

1491
01:55:38,299 --> 01:55:39,568
This is not allowed

1492
01:55:39,626 --> 01:55:40,933
until the evening.

1493
01:55:51,492 --> 01:55:52,661
Let me help you.

1494
01:55:57,170 --> 01:55:58,652
Quick quick quick

1495
01:56:04,683 --> 01:56:06,273
We've got to go out there.

1496
01:56:11,041 --> 01:56:11,844
Don't go.

1497
01:56:13,383 --> 01:56:14,545
Look alive, Rebeka.

1498
01:56:19,192 --> 01:56:20,960
<i>Good night, mother</i>

1499
01:56:21,741 --> 01:56:23,946
Run around. Faster faster

1500
01:56:29,548 --> 01:56:31,536
Run around. Run around.

1501
01:56:33,942 --> 01:56:35,666
<i>Good night</i>

1502
01:56:37,259 --> 01:56:38,563
That's my mechanic.

1503
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:41,505
Whose bright idea was it to get rid of him?

1504
01:56:49,478 --> 01:56:51,938
Move. Run around.

1505
01:56:53,223 --> 01:56:56,670
Hurry hurry. Keep your clothes.

1506
01:56:56,728 --> 01:56:58,911
<i>Good night</i>

1507
01:57:09,219 --> 01:57:11,527
Open your mouth. Let me see your throat.

1508
01:57:12,084 --> 01:57:15,344
Take a deep breath. Yes yes

1509
01:57:22,657 --> 01:57:23,701
Lift your arms.

1510
01:57:24,834 --> 01:57:25,733
Turn around.

1511
01:57:26,483 --> 01:57:27,340
Squat down.

1512
01:57:33,780 --> 01:57:35,340
Form a column.

1513
01:57:43,259 --> 01:57:45,813
No no no. Wait. Go away. She can work.

1514
01:57:45,874 --> 01:57:47,004
Come here. Look.

1515
01:57:48,260 --> 01:57:49,670
Separate the sick from the healthy:

1516
01:57:49,731 --> 01:57:51,728
those who can work
and those who can't. She can work.

1517
01:57:52,380 --> 01:57:53,687
You can work. You can come.

1518
01:57:54,580 --> 01:57:56,692
Move. Hurry up.

1519
01:59:17,894 --> 01:59:20,648
Those not selected for transport

1520
01:59:21,773 --> 01:59:22,948
put your clothes back on.

1521
01:59:23,006 --> 01:59:24,100
Go back to the barracks.

1522
01:59:25,207 --> 01:59:26,854
Return to the barracks.

1523
01:59:33,492 --> 01:59:34,609
Go back to the barracks.

1524
01:59:39,131 --> 01:59:40,281
Oh my God

1525
02:00:02,569 --> 02:00:04,131
Olek? Olek?

1526
02:00:04,935 --> 02:00:05,742
Danka?

1527
02:00:05,930 --> 02:00:07,774
Olek? Olek?

1528
02:00:10,332 --> 02:00:13,618
Olek Olek

1529
02:00:22,147 --> 02:00:22,689
Olek?

1530
02:00:22,747 --> 02:00:23,675
Danka?

1531
02:00:23,890 --> 02:00:25,658
- Danka?
- Olek?

1532
02:00:25,716 --> 02:00:27,523
Get into the barracks.

1533
02:00:27,738 --> 02:00:28,850
Into the barracks with you.

1534
02:00:28,908 --> 02:00:30,390
I didn't see him.

1535
02:00:30,448 --> 02:00:32,412
They're hiding.
I'm telling you, they're hiding.

1536
02:00:32,796 --> 02:00:36,224
I know Danka. She knows
a good place. She took all of them together.

1537
02:00:36,300 --> 02:00:38,960
Back to the barracks.

1538
02:00:57,761 --> 02:01:01,827
Find your own hiding place.
There's no room for you here. Go away, quick.

1539
02:01:25,505 --> 02:01:28,223
Get out. This is our place. Get out.

1540
02:01:50,966 --> 02:01:51,747
Oskar

1541
02:01:51,956 --> 02:01:53,291
Amon, gentlemen

1542
02:01:54,317 --> 02:01:55,184
why didn't you call me?

1543
02:01:55,242 --> 02:01:57,475
I tried to call you. Here, Hujar. Move.

1544
02:01:57,674 --> 02:01:59,564
Quite a picnic, huh? Madritsch, Oskar

1545
02:01:59,647 --> 02:02:00,907
they're running a little late, you know?

1546
02:02:00,966 --> 02:02:02,167
It's taking longer than I thought.

1547
02:02:03,100 --> 02:02:03,885
A drink?

1548
02:02:04,488 --> 02:02:05,850
Something cold. Bowle.

1549
02:02:05,926 --> 02:02:06,703
The Bowle.

1550
02:02:10,049 --> 02:02:12,225
Oh another beautiful day!

1551
02:02:15,867 --> 02:02:17,068
Silence. Quiet.

1552
02:02:25,688 --> 02:02:28,010
Loading of the transport wagons is finished.

1553
02:02:28,126 --> 02:02:29,086
We are ready for departure.

1554
02:02:30,384 --> 02:02:31,246
Water

1555
02:02:32,344 --> 02:02:33,890
Water

1556
02:02:35,323 --> 02:02:38,595
Water water

1557
02:02:43,206 --> 02:02:43,965
Well done

1558
02:02:44,444 --> 02:02:45,568
Oh thank you

1559
02:02:51,349 --> 02:02:53,219
What
do you say, we get your fire hoses out here

1560
02:02:53,363 --> 02:02:55,049
and hose down the cars? Thank you.

1561
02:02:59,283 --> 02:03:00,300
Indulge me.

1562
02:03:02,805 --> 02:03:04,024
- Hujar
- Yes, sir

1563
02:03:04,805 --> 02:03:06,185
Go and bring the fire hoses.

1564
02:03:06,942 --> 02:03:07,716
Where's the fire?

1565
02:03:12,153 --> 02:03:14,684
In the windows. That's it, that's it.

1566
02:03:14,742 --> 02:03:15,506
On the roof.

1567
02:03:15,926 --> 02:03:18,836
That's it.
Good good. In the window, in the window.

1568
02:03:21,801 --> 02:03:24,171
Come on. Come on.

1569
02:03:25,484 --> 02:03:26,609
That's it. More more.

1570
02:03:32,091 --> 02:03:34,805
That's it. That's it. More more.

1571
02:03:35,363 --> 02:03:38,457
This is really
cruel, Oskar. You are giving them hope.

1572
02:03:38,935 --> 02:03:40,037
You shouldn't do that.

1573
02:03:41,488 --> 02:03:42,559
That's cruel.

1574
02:03:42,764 --> 02:03:45,567
Come on. Try and reach the far end. Look out.

1575
02:03:45,626 --> 02:03:47,738
Water, more water

1576
02:03:52,082 --> 02:03:54,604
I've got some 200-meter hoses back in Emalia.

1577
02:03:54,716 --> 02:03:56,581
I have 20 meters at home in my garden.

1578
02:03:56,639 --> 02:03:57,997
We can reach the cars at the end.

1579
02:03:58,647 --> 02:03:59,318
What?

1580
02:04:00,131 --> 02:04:00,961
What?

1581
02:04:05,451 --> 02:04:06,010
Hujar

1582
02:04:06,243 --> 02:04:07,506
Yeah, sure

1583
02:04:26,238 --> 02:04:27,332
Don't forget the roof.

1584
02:04:28,040 --> 02:04:29,528
On the roof on the other side.

1585
02:04:37,359 --> 02:04:38,251
Scharfuhrer

1586
02:04:38,920 --> 02:04:40,242
every time the train stops

1587
02:04:40,399 --> 02:04:42,014
you open the doors
and you give them water, yeah?

1588
02:04:42,073 --> 02:04:42,609
Yes, sir

1589
02:04:43,117 --> 02:04:44,885
This car, this car

1590
02:05:08,685 --> 02:05:11,095
I'm not saying
you'll regret it but you might.

1591
02:05:11,881 --> 02:05:13,117
You should be aware of that.

1592
02:05:13,598 --> 02:05:15,250
We will have to risk regret.

1593
02:05:16,478 --> 02:05:19,599
All right. Sure. It's a nice day.
I'll go for a drive with you.

1594
02:05:54,796 --> 02:05:55,920
What about you?

1595
02:05:56,795 --> 02:05:58,805
I violated the Race and Resettlement Act

1596
02:06:00,193 --> 02:06:02,939
though I doubt anyone
can point out the actual provision to me.

1597
02:06:04,234 --> 02:06:06,001
I kissed a jewish girl.

1598
02:06:11,474 --> 02:06:12,680
Did your prick fall off?

1599
02:06:31,591 --> 02:06:33,033
He likes women.

1600
02:06:35,912 --> 02:06:38,242
He likes good-looking women.

1601
02:06:40,167 --> 02:06:43,211
He sees a beautiful woman, he doesn't think.

1602
02:06:46,229 --> 02:06:47,055
I mean

1603
02:06:47,113 --> 02:06:48,569
he has so many women

1604
02:06:48,996 --> 02:06:50,684
and they love him.

1605
02:06:51,796 --> 02:06:54,694
Yes, they love him.
I mean, he is married, yes but he's

1606
02:06:56,234 --> 02:06:57,314
All right. No.

1607
02:06:58,203 --> 02:06:59,868
She was jewish. He shouldn't have done it

1608
02:06:59,926 --> 02:07:02,394
but you didn't see this girl.

1609
02:07:03,434 --> 02:07:05,933
I saw this girl. This girl was, woof!

1610
02:07:06,737 --> 02:07:08,536
She was very good-looking.

1611
02:07:13,033 --> 02:07:14,782
They cast a spell on you, you know, the jews.

1612
02:07:15,434 --> 02:07:17,456
When you work
closely with them, like I do, you see this.

1613
02:07:17,555 --> 02:07:19,358
They have this power. It's like a virus.

1614
02:07:19,524 --> 02:07:21,278
Some of my men are infected with this virus.

1615
02:07:21,354 --> 02:07:23,616
They should be pitied,
not punished. They should receive treatment.

1616
02:07:23,674 --> 02:07:26,478
This is
as real as typhus. I see this all the time.

1617
02:07:26,591 --> 02:07:27,804
It's a matter of money?

1618
02:07:28,600 --> 02:07:29,210
Hmm?

1619
02:07:30,313 --> 02:07:31,550
You're offering me a bribe?

1620
02:07:34,073 --> 02:07:35,005
A bribe? No

1621
02:07:35,899 --> 02:07:36,492
No, please

1622
02:07:37,627 --> 02:07:38,613
It's a gratuity.

1623
02:07:39,809 --> 02:07:40,599
Heil Hitler

1624
02:07:45,032 --> 02:07:46,085
Hello, Amon

1625
02:07:50,692 --> 02:07:51,296
Sit down.

1626
02:07:54,430 --> 02:07:57,216
We give you
jewish girls at five marks a day, Oskar.

1627
02:07:57,951 --> 02:07:59,795
You should kiss us, not them.

1628
02:08:00,385 --> 02:08:03,473
God forbid,
you ever get a real taste for jewish skirt!

1629
02:08:04,069 --> 02:08:05,359
There's no future in it.

1630
02:08:05,505 --> 02:08:06,612
They don't have a future.

1631
02:08:08,149 --> 02:08:10,433
That's not just
good, old-fashioned, jew-hating talk.

1632
02:08:12,069 --> 02:08:13,001
It's policy now.

1633
02:08:16,997 --> 02:08:18,679
Yes, already caught. Good.

1634
02:08:25,747 --> 02:08:28,716
One more, yes, nice

1635
02:08:58,466 --> 02:08:59,951
Let's go then. Move.

1636
02:09:00,211 --> 02:09:03,577
Faster here. Quick quick quick

1637
02:09:03,747 --> 02:09:05,189
Move your ass.

1638
02:09:07,667 --> 02:09:09,314
Faster.

1639
02:09:09,426 --> 02:09:10,867
Move youselves.

1640
02:09:10,925 --> 02:09:11,885
Don't go to sleep.

1641
02:09:13,308 --> 02:09:14,988
Only the whole scraps, not the vegetables

1642
02:09:15,067 --> 02:09:16,345
Come on. You can do that with your hands.

1643
02:09:16,403 --> 02:09:18,573
Take the lead.

1644
02:09:22,426 --> 02:09:24,707
Leave the small pieces.

1645
02:09:51,265 --> 02:09:52,703
That's how it is: Valhalla.

1646
02:09:53,184 --> 02:09:55,104
Valhalla's calling here.

1647
02:09:59,783 --> 02:10:00,809
Can you believe this?

1648
02:10:01,703 --> 02:10:03,964
As if I don't
have enough to do, they come up with this!

1649
02:10:04,984 --> 02:10:07,991
I have to find
every rag buried up here and burn it.

1650
02:10:10,431 --> 02:10:12,064
The party's over, Oskar. They're closing

1651
02:10:12,123 --> 02:10:13,382
us down, sending everybody to Auschwitz.

1652
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:13,944
When?

1653
02:10:14,034 --> 02:10:15,949
I don't know.
As soon as I can arrange the shipments:

1654
02:10:16,007 --> 02:10:19,367
maybe 30, 40 days. That ought to be fun.

1655
02:10:39,668 --> 02:10:41,221
I've been talking to Goeth.

1656
02:10:41,279 --> 02:10:42,226
I know the destination.

1657
02:10:42,301 --> 02:10:44,043
These are the evacuation orders.

1658
02:10:45,065 --> 02:10:47,953
I'm to help organize the shipments
and put myself on the last train.

1659
02:10:48,019 --> 02:10:49,586
That's not what I was going to say.

1660
02:10:50,944 --> 02:10:53,422
I made Goeth
promise me, he'll put in a good word for you.

1661
02:10:54,743 --> 02:10:56,364
Nothing bad is going to happen to you there.

1662
02:10:56,422 --> 02:10:57,828
You'll receive special treatment.

1663
02:10:58,101 --> 02:10:59,829
The directives coming in from Berlin

1664
02:10:59,887 --> 02:11:01,791
mention
"special treatment" more and more often.

1665
02:11:01,863 --> 02:11:03,659
I'd like to think that's not what you mean.

1666
02:11:03,958 --> 02:11:05,645
..."preferential treatment", all right?

1667
02:11:06,221 --> 02:11:07,796
Do we have to invent a whole new language?

1668
02:11:08,382 --> 02:11:09,110
I think so.

1669
02:11:13,074 --> 02:11:14,239
You're staying, I take it.

1670
02:11:18,694 --> 02:11:20,538
In Krakow? What on Earth for?

1671
02:11:20,623 --> 02:11:22,123
What for? You have a business to run.

1672
02:11:24,592 --> 02:11:26,724
Of course, you'll
have to hire new workers... Poles, I guess.

1673
02:11:26,782 --> 02:11:28,011
They cost a little more, but...

1674
02:11:31,742 --> 02:11:32,632
What are you going to do?

1675
02:11:37,181 --> 02:11:38,613
You ran my business.

1676
02:11:42,779 --> 02:11:44,283
No. I'm going home.

1677
02:11:44,779 --> 02:11:46,189
I've done what I came here for.

1678
02:11:46,239 --> 02:11:48,778
I've got more money
than any man can spend in a lifetime.

1679
02:12:00,461 --> 02:12:01,601
Some day

1680
02:12:02,962 --> 02:12:05,078
this is all going to end, you know.

1681
02:12:09,337 --> 02:12:11,185
I was going to say, we'll have a drink then.

1682
02:12:15,849 --> 02:12:17,033
I think I'd better have it now.

1683
02:12:41,618 --> 02:12:45,340
<i>Bible says. And it still is news.</i>

1684
02:12:46,658 --> 02:12:52,224
<i>Mama may have. Papa may have.</i>

1685
02:12:53,137 --> 02:12:57,940
<i>But God bless the child
That's got his own</i>

1686
02:12:58,176 --> 02:13:00,784
<i>That's got his own.</i>

1687
02:13:04,578 --> 02:13:08,703
<i>Yes, the strong gets more</i>

1688
02:13:08,860 --> 02:13:11,587
<i>While the weak ones fade.</i>

1689
02:13:13,418 --> 02:13:18,864
<i>Empty pockets don't ever make the grade.</i>

1690
02:13:19,618 --> 02:13:24,779
<i>Mama may have. Papa may have.</i>

1691
02:13:27,016 --> 02:13:31,097
<i>But God bless the child
That's got his own</i>

1692
02:13:31,899 --> 02:13:34,779
<i>That's got his own.</i>

1693
02:13:39,936 --> 02:13:45,261
<i>Money, you've got lots of friends.</i>

1694
02:13:48,503 --> 02:13:50,792
<i>They're pounding on your</i>

1695
02:13:50,875 --> 02:13:51,601
I don't understand.

1696
02:13:53,485 --> 02:13:54,601
You want these people?

1697
02:13:54,735 --> 02:13:57,060
"These" people? My people! I want my people.

1698
02:13:57,136 --> 02:13:58,409
Who are you? Moses?

1699
02:13:59,003 --> 02:14:00,016
Come on. What is this?

1700
02:14:00,096 --> 02:14:01,637
Where's the money in this? Where's the scam?

1701
02:14:01,766 --> 02:14:03,065
It's good business.

1702
02:14:03,125 --> 02:14:04,779
It's good business in your opinion.

1703
02:14:04,855 --> 02:14:06,445
Look. You've got to move them

1704
02:14:06,908 --> 02:14:07,743
the equipment

1705
02:14:07,895 --> 02:14:09,257
everything to Czechoslovakia

1706
02:14:09,335 --> 02:14:11,333
pay for all that and build another camp.

1707
02:14:11,828 --> 02:14:13,284
- It doesn't make any sense.
- Look, Amon.

1708
02:14:13,342 --> 02:14:14,860
- You're not telling me something.
- It's good for me.

1709
02:14:15,895 --> 02:14:17,797
I know them. I'm familiar with them.
I don't have to train them.

1710
02:14:17,855 --> 02:14:18,703
You're not telling me something.

1711
02:14:18,761 --> 02:14:20,315
It's good for you. I'll compensate you.

1712
02:14:20,375 --> 02:14:21,917
That's right. It's good for the army.

1713
02:14:22,217 --> 02:14:23,101
Yeah, of course.

1714
02:14:23,159 --> 02:14:24,467
- Do you know what I'm going to make?
- What?

1715
02:14:25,815 --> 02:14:27,677
- Artillery shells.
- Everyone's making artillery shells.

1716
02:14:27,735 --> 02:14:29,317
- Tank shells. They need that.
- Tanks shells, yeah.

1717
02:14:29,373 --> 02:14:31,688
- Everybody's happy.
- Everyone's happy except me.

1718
02:14:32,204 --> 02:14:34,119
You're probably scamming me somehow.

1719
02:14:35,404 --> 02:14:37,708
If I'm making 100,
you've got to be making 300

1720
02:14:38,293 --> 02:14:40,563
and
if you admit to 300, then it's 400, actually.

1721
02:14:41,125 --> 02:14:41,686
But how?

1722
02:14:41,744 --> 02:14:42,547
I just told you.

1723
02:14:42,605 --> 02:14:43,896
You did but you didn't.

1724
02:14:47,253 --> 02:14:48,543
Yeah, all right. Don't tell me.

1725
02:14:49,413 --> 02:14:50,382
I'll go along with it.

1726
02:14:52,136 --> 02:14:53,554
It's just irritating. I can't work it out.

1727
02:14:53,612 --> 02:14:54,150
Look.

1728
02:14:54,993 --> 02:14:57,161
All you have to do
is tell me what it's worth to you.

1729
02:14:58,373 --> 02:15:00,587
- What's a person worth to you?
- No no no no

1730
02:15:00,851 --> 02:15:02,716
What's one worth to you?

1731
02:15:11,212 --> 02:15:14,614
Poldek Pfefferberg, Mila Pfefferberg

1732
02:15:15,411 --> 02:15:15,936
and

1733
02:15:18,583 --> 02:15:20,578
uh Stagel, Stagel...

1734
02:15:20,637 --> 02:15:22,181
Paul: Paul Stagel

1735
02:15:22,449 --> 02:15:23,317
Doctor

1736
02:15:25,730 --> 02:15:26,766
The investors

1737
02:15:28,103 --> 02:15:29,391
- I want all of them.
- Yes, sir

1738
02:15:30,331 --> 02:15:31,891
Fischer, Ismail Fischer

1739
02:15:32,011 --> 02:15:34,783
Fischer, Ismail

1740
02:15:35,409 --> 02:15:37,014
Josef Scharf

1741
02:15:37,074 --> 02:15:38,792
One moment, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

1742
02:15:38,851 --> 02:15:40,511
Come on, Stern. Scharf Scharf

1743
02:15:43,627 --> 02:15:45,926
the children, all the children

1744
02:15:51,012 --> 02:15:52,933
- Herbert Stier
- Thank you.

1745
02:15:53,574 --> 02:15:54,250
How many?

1746
02:15:54,962 --> 02:15:56,837
400, 450

1747
02:15:59,730 --> 02:16:00,605
More more

1748
02:16:24,846 --> 02:16:27,297
- Feigenbaum, Jakob
- Wolf: Wolf Wein

1749
02:16:33,804 --> 02:16:36,782
Feigenbaum, Lutek; Jakob... Nacha

1750
02:16:37,626 --> 02:16:38,304
- Yes?
- Necha

1751
02:16:38,751 --> 02:16:39,805
Necha, that's right.

1752
02:16:40,237 --> 02:16:41,049
...and Wolf

1753
02:16:42,353 --> 02:16:42,992
How many?

1754
02:16:46,184 --> 02:16:46,742
600

1755
02:16:48,212 --> 02:16:48,751
More

1756
02:16:50,887 --> 02:16:52,119
You can do the same thing I'm doing.

1757
02:16:52,179 --> 02:16:53,201
You might even make money at it.

1758
02:16:54,034 --> 02:16:54,679
I don't know.

1759
02:16:54,739 --> 02:16:57,679
Come on, Julius. I know about
the extra food and clothes you give them

1760
02:16:57,737 --> 02:16:59,063
paid for out of your own pocket.

1761
02:16:59,442 --> 02:17:00,617
If we make a combined approach

1762
02:17:00,677 --> 02:17:02,566
we could
get more than 4,000 out, mine and yours.

1763
02:17:02,625 --> 02:17:03,069
Oskar

1764
02:17:03,126 --> 02:17:05,369
We could relocate them
in something like safety, in Moravia.

1765
02:17:07,697 --> 02:17:08,340
I don't know.

1766
02:17:11,322 --> 02:17:12,986
How many cigarettes have you smoked tonight?

1767
02:17:13,607 --> 02:17:14,192
Too many.

1768
02:17:14,687 --> 02:17:15,450
For every one

1769
02:17:16,628 --> 02:17:17,787
you smoke, I smoke half.

1770
02:17:19,805 --> 02:17:21,573
- I've done all I can.
- I will not accept that.

1771
02:17:21,646 --> 02:17:23,186
No Oskar. I can't do any more.

1772
02:17:23,244 --> 02:17:24,427
I will not accept that.

1773
02:17:25,005 --> 02:17:25,715
No

1774
02:17:36,045 --> 02:17:37,117
How many? How many?

1775
02:17:37,278 --> 02:17:40,309
- 850, give or take
- Give or take what, Stern?

1776
02:17:40,451 --> 02:17:42,259
Give or take what? Count them. How many?

1777
02:17:52,835 --> 02:17:53,468
That's it.

1778
02:17:53,967 --> 02:17:55,073
You can finish that page.

1779
02:18:00,724 --> 02:18:04,236
What did Goeth say about this?

1780
02:18:04,295 --> 02:18:07,503
You just
told him how many people you needed and...

1781
02:18:11,192 --> 02:18:12,209
You're not buying them!

1782
02:18:15,842 --> 02:18:17,179
You're buying them?

1783
02:18:17,697 --> 02:18:18,812
You're paying him for each of these names?

1784
02:18:18,914 --> 02:18:20,032
If you were still working for me

1785
02:18:20,090 --> 02:18:21,473
I'd expect you to talk me out of it.

1786
02:18:21,804 --> 02:18:23,099
It's costing me a fortune.

1787
02:18:25,625 --> 02:18:27,865
Finish the page
and leave one space at the bottom.

1788
02:18:50,482 --> 02:18:50,981
You...

1789
02:18:58,148 --> 02:18:59,948
The list is an absolute good.

1790
02:19:02,228 --> 02:19:04,552
The list is life.

1791
02:19:06,450 --> 02:19:09,775
All around its margins lies the gulf.

1792
02:19:11,632 --> 02:19:13,821
Oskar, there's a clerical error here

1793
02:19:13,992 --> 02:19:15,438
at the bottom of the last page.

1794
02:19:15,561 --> 02:19:17,590
No.
There's one more name I want to put there.

1795
02:19:18,049 --> 02:19:20,526
I'll never find
a maid as well trained as her at Brinnlitz.

1796
02:19:20,778 --> 02:19:21,991
They are all country girls.

1797
02:19:23,869 --> 02:19:24,483
No

1798
02:19:33,998 --> 02:19:34,455
No

1799
02:19:35,795 --> 02:19:36,965
One hand of 21

1800
02:19:37,456 --> 02:19:37,843
No

1801
02:19:37,920 --> 02:19:40,644
- If you win, I pay you 7,400 reichsmarks.
- No

1802
02:19:40,705 --> 02:19:43,698
- Hit a natural and I'll make it 14,800.
- No

1803
02:19:44,438 --> 02:19:46,262
If I win, the girl goes on my list.

1804
02:19:47,800 --> 02:19:49,585
I can't wager Helen in a card game.

1805
02:19:49,644 --> 02:19:50,296
Why not?

1806
02:19:50,743 --> 02:19:51,608
It wouldn't be right.

1807
02:19:51,800 --> 02:19:53,470
She's just going to Auschwitz No. 2 anyway.

1808
02:19:53,529 --> 02:19:55,350
- What difference does it make?
- She's not going to Auschwitz.

1809
02:19:55,439 --> 02:19:56,495
I'd never do that to her.

1810
02:19:57,899 --> 02:19:59,963
No.
I want her to come back to Vienna with me.

1811
02:20:00,039 --> 02:20:01,046
I want her to come

1812
02:20:01,845 --> 02:20:04,367
to work
for me there. I want to grow old with her.

1813
02:20:05,010 --> 02:20:05,921
Are you mad?

1814
02:20:07,662 --> 02:20:08,270
Amon

1815
02:20:09,147 --> 02:20:10,591
you can't take her to Vienna with you.

1816
02:20:11,001 --> 02:20:12,335
No. Of course I can't.

1817
02:20:13,932 --> 02:20:15,012
That's what I'd like to do.

1818
02:20:16,416 --> 02:20:19,300
What I can do, if I'm any sort of a man

1819
02:20:20,336 --> 02:20:22,091
is the next most merciful thing.

1820
02:20:22,340 --> 02:20:23,573
I shall take her into the woods and

1821
02:20:23,828 --> 02:20:25,707
shoot her painlessly in the back of the head.

1822
02:20:35,856 --> 02:20:37,314
What was it you said for a

1823
02:20:38,162 --> 02:20:39,361
natural 21?

1824
02:20:40,287 --> 02:20:41,698
Was it 14,800?

1825
02:20:42,724 --> 02:20:45,762
Schindler jews
to these tables. Say your names clearly.

1826
02:20:45,822 --> 02:20:47,702
We are the family Dresner:

1827
02:20:47,966 --> 02:20:50,475
Juda, Jonas, Donata, and Chaja.

1828
02:20:51,957 --> 02:20:55,227
We are Rosners: Henry, Manci and Leo

1829
02:20:55,555 --> 02:20:56,975
- and our son.
- I am Olek.

1831
02:21:00,100 --> 02:21:00,939

Jakob Levartov

1838
02:21:19,675 --> 02:21:21,549
- Farber, Rosa
- Farber, Andrzej

1839
02:21:22,395 --> 02:21:22,992
Sara

1840
02:21:23,496 --> 02:21:24,420
Friehof, Fischel

1841
02:21:26,204 --> 02:21:27,087
Mietek Pemper

1842
02:21:28,154 --> 02:21:29,623
Poldek and Mila Pfefferberg

1843
02:21:30,754 --> 02:21:32,017

Adam Levy

1845
02:21:36,296 --> 02:21:37,216
Marcel Goldberg

1846

Klipstein, Isak David

1847
02:21:41,912 --> 02:21:42,887
Altmann, Eduard

1848
02:21:43,912 --> 02:21:44,921
Grunberg, Miriam

1849
02:21:45,796 --> 02:21:46,891
Luftig, Eliasz

1850
02:21:48,238 --> 02:21:49,101
Hilmann, Eduard

1851
02:21:49,915 --> 02:21:50,692
Erna Rothberg

1852
02:21:52,476 --> 02:21:53,612
Zuckermann, Jetti

1853
02:21:55,486 --> 02:21:56,440
Helen Hirsch

1854
02:21:59,074 --> 02:22:00,476
The worst is over.

1855
02:22:02,355 --> 02:22:05,015
Men to
this transport and women to this transport.

1856
02:22:06,476 --> 02:22:07,384
Be careful.

1857
02:22:07,940 --> 02:22:10,761
Men to
this transport and women to this transport.

1858
02:22:11,235 --> 02:22:14,904
Watch your step. Men to
this transport and women to this transport.

1859
02:22:51,952 --> 02:22:53,620
Wonderful, Olek

1860
02:22:55,065 --> 02:22:55,774
wonderful!

1861
02:22:56,115 --> 02:22:59,645
Do you know how we make ice into water?

1862
02:23:01,900 --> 02:23:03,176
Olek, get another one.

1863
02:23:40,306 --> 02:23:42,341
Everyone, stand in a single row.

1864
02:23:43,949 --> 02:23:45,112
You'll be pleased with the level

1865
02:23:45,171 --> 02:23:46,851
of efficiency I get from these workers.

1866
02:23:49,869 --> 02:23:51,741
Budzyn, under my command

1867
02:23:52,154 --> 02:23:54,538
was the envy of every other
commandant in the labour camp system.

1868
02:23:55,068 --> 02:23:56,332
- The prisoners, however
- Excuse me.

1869
02:23:56,413 --> 02:23:58,061
They would have rather been somewhere else...

1870
02:24:13,043 --> 02:24:16,042
The train
with the women has already left Plaszow

1871
02:24:16,320 --> 02:24:18,437
and will be arriving here very shortly.

1872
02:24:19,765 --> 02:24:21,636
I know you've had a long journey

1873
02:24:22,507 --> 02:24:25,235
but it's
only a short walk further to the factory

1874
02:24:25,543 --> 02:24:29,243
where hot soup and bread is waiting for you.

1875
02:24:31,059 --> 02:24:32,199
Welcome to Brinnlitz.

1876
02:24:42,266 --> 02:24:43,630
Beans in cholent?

1877
02:24:43,746 --> 02:24:45,342
Beans are the best part.

1878
02:24:45,440 --> 02:24:46,806
I don't like beans.

1879
02:24:47,707 --> 02:24:51,097
Beans and meat and potatoes and bread

1880
02:24:51,484 --> 02:24:53,667
That's not the way you make cholent.

1881
02:24:57,838 --> 02:24:58,918
Eggs in cholent?

1882
02:24:59,446 --> 02:25:00,296
Yes

1883
02:25:03,186 --> 02:25:04,266
I don't like cholent.

1884
02:25:04,386 --> 02:25:05,467
No, you don't.

1885
02:25:05,917 --> 02:25:06,964
What do you like?

1886
02:25:07,217 --> 02:25:08,186
I like caviar.

1887
02:25:10,880 --> 02:25:12,440
One day on the fire...

1888
02:26:16,578 --> 02:26:18,671
All cars are in position.

1889
02:26:20,143 --> 02:26:22,029
Everyone, stay together in the group.

1890
02:26:22,939 --> 02:26:24,498
Stay away from the car.

1891
02:26:26,127 --> 02:26:27,318
Stay away from the car.

1892
02:26:28,633 --> 02:26:30,383
Stay away from the car, I said.

1893
02:26:34,265 --> 02:26:37,627
Faster quick quick quick

1894
02:26:38,743 --> 02:26:39,973
What's going on here?

1895
02:26:43,732 --> 02:26:44,288
Quick

1896
02:26:49,763 --> 02:26:51,891
Get out. Quick quick quick. Out.

1897
02:26:53,248 --> 02:26:59,711
30, 35, 40, 45...

1898
02:27:00,908 --> 02:27:01,815
Get out.

1899
02:27:13,701 --> 02:27:15,202
Where are the list makers?

1900
02:27:15,305 --> 02:27:16,306
Where are the tables?

1901
02:27:21,940 --> 02:27:23,264
Get out.

1902
02:27:24,661 --> 02:27:25,424
Hopp hopp

1903
02:27:25,484 --> 02:27:26,731
...luggage in wagons

1904
02:27:28,582 --> 02:27:31,222
Quick. Get out. Faster.

1905
02:27:31,661 --> 02:27:33,984
Leave the luggage in the wagons.

1906
02:27:34,660 --> 02:27:35,442
Faster.

1907
02:27:36,051 --> 02:27:38,315
Go faster.

1908
02:27:38,636 --> 02:27:39,945
Mama, where are we?

1909
02:27:44,230 --> 02:27:45,424
They're in Auschwitz.

1910
02:27:45,638 --> 02:27:48,030
The train was
never routed here: a paperwork mistake.

1911
02:27:55,902 --> 02:27:57,240
Hurry. Fast.

1912
02:27:57,297 --> 02:27:59,098
Remove your shoes.

1913
02:28:12,181 --> 02:28:13,101
Faster faster

1914
02:28:13,160 --> 02:28:14,208
Fold your clothing.

1915
02:28:17,259 --> 02:28:18,119
To the shower.

1916
02:28:18,177 --> 02:28:19,702
Remove your clothes. Move.

1917
02:28:19,777 --> 02:28:20,430
Move.

1918
02:28:20,488 --> 02:28:22,386
Stand up and go out.

1919
02:28:22,458 --> 02:28:23,723
Undress faster.

1920
02:28:23,783 --> 02:28:24,544
Faster.

1921
02:28:26,937 --> 02:28:28,236
Undress quickly.

1922
02:28:29,777 --> 02:28:31,094
Get soap and towel

1923
02:28:31,152 --> 02:28:33,609
and go to the shower for disinfection.

1924
02:28:33,982 --> 02:28:35,270
Undress quickly.

1925
02:28:39,824 --> 02:28:40,495
Faster.

1926
02:28:40,553 --> 02:28:42,504
Take that soap quickly.

1927
02:28:42,665 --> 02:28:45,198
Move out faster. Move.

1928
02:28:51,875 --> 02:28:52,806
Quickly quickly

1929
02:28:52,864 --> 02:28:53,886
Get in immediately. Faster.

1930
02:28:54,936 --> 02:28:56,900
Into the shower. Quick.

1931
02:28:56,976 --> 02:28:58,044
Faster.

1932
02:28:58,896 --> 02:29:00,574
Into the bath. Faster.

1933
02:29:03,534 --> 02:29:06,415
Faster faster

1934
02:29:08,033 --> 02:29:09,713
Quickly quickly

1935
02:29:10,534 --> 02:29:11,342
Come in.

1936
02:31:31,527 --> 02:31:32,694
Look down.

1937
02:31:36,005 --> 02:31:37,461
Hands on shoulders.

1938
02:31:38,613 --> 02:31:39,815
How old are you, mother?

1939
02:31:40,088 --> 02:31:41,333
Sixty-eight.

1940
02:31:41,812 --> 02:31:42,524
Cough for me, mother.

1941
02:31:42,583 --> 02:31:46,351
They say,
to fall against the fence is a kindness.

1942
02:31:46,776 --> 02:31:49,505
Don't kill yourself against the fence, Clara.

1943
02:31:49,809 --> 02:31:52,177
If you do,
we'll never know what happened to you.

1944
02:31:55,408 --> 02:31:56,461
How old are you, mother?

1945
02:31:56,630 --> 02:31:57,886
66, sir.

1946
02:31:58,007 --> 02:31:58,526
Sir?

1947
02:31:59,178 --> 02:31:59,881
Good morning

1948
02:32:00,047 --> 02:32:02,748
A mistake has
been made. We are not supposed to be here.

1949
02:32:03,007 --> 02:32:04,587
We work for Oskar Schindler.

1950
02:32:05,112 --> 02:32:06,350
We are Schindler jews.

1951
02:32:06,726 --> 02:32:07,949
Who is Oskar Schindler?

1952
02:32:08,357 --> 02:32:09,824
He had a factory in Krakow:

1953
02:32:10,068 --> 02:32:10,757
enamelware.

1954
02:32:12,163 --> 02:32:13,494
A pot maker.

1955
02:32:14,797 --> 02:32:15,954
How old are you, mother?

1956
02:32:20,949 --> 02:32:24,020
You are not
the only industrialist who needs labour

1957
02:32:26,406 --> 02:32:27,284
Herr Schindler.

1958
02:32:28,967 --> 02:32:31,732
I remember,
earlier this year, IG Farben ordered

1959
02:32:31,792 --> 02:32:33,473
a trainload of Hungarians

1960
02:32:34,350 --> 02:32:35,871
for its chemical factory.

1961
02:32:37,527 --> 02:32:40,133
The train came in through the archway

1962
02:32:41,297 --> 02:32:45,159
and the officer in charge
of the selection went immediately to work

1963
02:32:46,757 --> 02:32:48,524
and sent 2,000 of them

1964
02:32:49,244 --> 02:32:51,012
straight away to special treatment.

1965
02:32:53,446 --> 02:32:55,472
It is not my task to interfere with

1966
02:32:55,531 --> 02:32:57,255
the processes that take place down here.

1967
02:32:59,845 --> 02:33:01,486
Why do you think I can help you

1968
02:33:02,156 --> 02:33:03,931
if I can't help IG Farben?

1969
02:33:04,913 --> 02:33:06,470
Allow me to express the reason.

1970
02:33:16,244 --> 02:33:18,234
I'm not making any judgement about you.

1971
02:33:19,404 --> 02:33:22,044
It's
just that I know that in the coming months

1972
02:33:22,101 --> 02:33:24,087
we're all going to need portable wealth.

1973
02:33:28,204 --> 02:33:30,022
I could have you arrested.

1974
02:33:30,843 --> 02:33:32,684
I'm protected by powerful friends.

1975
02:33:33,510 --> 02:33:34,309
You should know that.

1976
02:33:38,324 --> 02:33:40,556
I do not say I am accepting them.

1977
02:33:42,204 --> 02:33:45,061
All I say is,
I'm not comfortable with them on the table.

1978
02:34:00,204 --> 02:34:02,200
I have a shipment coming in tomorrow.

1979
02:34:03,479 --> 02:34:05,324
I'll cut you 300 units from it:

1980
02:34:05,602 --> 02:34:06,357
new ones.

1981
02:34:07,718 --> 02:34:08,704
These are fresh.

1982
02:34:13,282 --> 02:34:15,530
The train comes, we turn it around.

1983
02:34:15,588 --> 02:34:16,811
Mmm yes yes

1984
02:34:16,870 --> 02:34:18,182
- It's yours.
- I understand.

1985
02:34:18,833 --> 02:34:19,551
I want these.

1986
02:34:23,858 --> 02:34:25,727
You shouldn't get stuck on names.

1987
02:34:33,843 --> 02:34:34,733
That's right.

1988
02:34:35,593 --> 02:34:37,057
It creates a lot of paperwork.

1989
02:34:38,041 --> 02:34:39,968
Zoldinger, Ernestina

1990
02:34:40,157 --> 02:34:41,863
Waldergrun, Hilda

1991
02:34:42,001 --> 02:34:43,847
Waldergrun, Leonora

1992
02:34:44,041 --> 02:34:45,545
Laast, Anna

1993
02:34:45,685 --> 02:34:47,366
Pfefferberg, Mila

1994
02:34:47,521 --> 02:34:48,807
Dresner, Horsch

1995
02:34:49,230 --> 02:34:50,940
Dresner, Danka

1996
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:52,717
Nussbaum, Sidonia

1997
02:34:52,819 --> 02:34:54,343
Rosner, Manci

1998
02:34:54,560 --> 02:34:56,079
Hirsch, Helen

1999
02:34:56,138 --> 02:34:57,881
Grosz, Chaja Sara

2000
02:34:58,093 --> 02:34:59,874
Seelenfreund, Estella

2001
02:35:14,479 --> 02:35:15,446
Run faster.

2002
02:35:15,566 --> 02:35:17,777
Run faster. Faster.

2003
02:35:17,836 --> 02:35:20,373
Faster. Faster. Come on. Forward.

2004
02:35:21,681 --> 02:35:24,084
Go on. Go on. Go on. Faster.

2005
02:35:27,519 --> 02:35:28,682
Faster. Move.

2006
02:35:31,798 --> 02:35:33,363
Scare them. Scare them.

2007
02:35:38,998 --> 02:35:41,914
No no no

2008
02:35:44,420 --> 02:35:48,110
Girl, let's go now. Now, quickly.

2009
02:35:59,357 --> 02:36:02,806
Danka Danka Danka

2010
02:36:02,878 --> 02:36:05,200
No no no

2011
02:36:07,289 --> 02:36:10,884
Hey hey hey. What are you doing?

2012
02:36:11,277 --> 02:36:14,878
These are mine. These
are my workers. They should be on my train.

2013
02:36:15,837 --> 02:36:18,039
They're skilled
munitions workers. They're essential

2014
02:36:18,876 --> 02:36:20,057
essential girls.

2015
02:36:23,595 --> 02:36:27,240
Their fingers
polish the insides of shell metal casings.

2016
02:36:27,932 --> 02:36:29,537
How else am I to polish the inside

2017
02:36:29,595 --> 02:36:31,160
of a 45 millimetre shell casing?

2018
02:36:31,356 --> 02:36:33,298
You tell me. You tell me.

2019
02:36:36,235 --> 02:36:37,381
Back on the train.

2020
02:36:38,769 --> 02:36:39,742
Back on the train.

2021
02:38:29,990 --> 02:38:32,839
Under Department W provisions

2022
02:38:33,950 --> 02:38:36,754
it is unlawful
to kill a worker without just cause.

2023
02:38:38,271 --> 02:38:40,670
Under the Businesses Compensation Fund

2024
02:38:41,269 --> 02:38:43,997
I am entitled
to file damage claims for such deaths.

2025
02:38:45,465 --> 02:38:47,626
If you shoot without thinking

2026
02:38:48,429 --> 02:38:49,445
you go to prison

2027
02:38:50,704 --> 02:38:51,575
I get paid.

2028
02:38:52,628 --> 02:38:53,485
That's how it works.

2029
02:38:54,828 --> 02:38:55,366
So

2030
02:38:56,223 --> 02:38:58,454
there will be no summary executions here.

2031
02:39:00,628 --> 02:39:03,673
There will be
no interference of any kind with production.

2032
02:39:05,268 --> 02:39:06,444
In hopes of ensuring that,

2033
02:39:07,019 --> 02:39:09,749
guards will
no longer be allowed on the factory floor

2034
02:39:10,227 --> 02:39:11,918
without my authorization.

2035
02:39:18,409 --> 02:39:20,839
For your cooperation you have my gratitude.

2036
02:39:23,360 --> 02:39:24,492
Come on. Come.

2037
02:39:25,989 --> 02:39:27,875
Man! I haven't seen such a thing for years.

2038
02:39:27,987 --> 02:39:29,333
Come on, boys. Come.

2039
02:39:29,390 --> 02:39:31,175
Look at the men.

2040
02:39:55,744 --> 02:39:56,685
No doorman

2041
02:39:57,543 --> 02:40:00,003
or maitre d' will ever mistake you again.

2042
02:40:01,388 --> 02:40:02,146
I promise.

2043
02:40:07,409 --> 02:40:07,954
Itzhak

2044
02:40:10,237 --> 02:40:11,977
This is Itzhak Stern, my accountant. Itzhak

2045
02:40:12,035 --> 02:40:13,649
You must be Mrs. Schindler.

2046
02:40:13,744 --> 02:40:14,566
It's a pleasure to meet you.

2047
02:40:14,676 --> 02:40:16,246
Emilie has volunteered to work in the clinic.

2048
02:40:16,304 --> 02:40:18,116
- Very generous of you.
- I know.

2049
02:40:18,173 --> 02:40:19,664
We need to talk when you have a moment.

2050
02:40:20,944 --> 02:40:23,227
This is my wife, Stern.
I don't keep any secrets from my spouse.

2051
02:40:23,287 --> 02:40:25,848
Oskar, please, attend
to business. It's much more attractive.

2052
02:40:26,387 --> 02:40:27,371
- Madam
- Hello

2053
02:40:27,431 --> 02:40:29,203
- What is it?
- We've received an angry complaint

2054
02:40:29,262 --> 02:40:30,347
from the Armaments Board.

2055
02:40:30,944 --> 02:40:32,985
The artillery shells,
tank shells, rocket casings

2056
02:40:33,063 --> 02:40:35,565
apparently all of them
have failed quality control tests.

2057
02:40:35,623 --> 02:40:37,471
That's to be expected: start-up problems.

2058
02:40:37,664 --> 02:40:39,803
This isn't
pots and pans. This is a precise business.

2059
02:40:39,862 --> 02:40:41,644
- I'll write them a letter.
- They're withholding payment.

2060
02:40:41,702 --> 02:40:43,468
Sure. So would I. So would you.

2061
02:40:43,543 --> 02:40:45,806
I wouldn't worry about it.
We'll get it right one of these days.

2062
02:40:45,862 --> 02:40:48,771
There's a rumour, you've been
going around miscalibrating the machines.

2063
02:40:50,423 --> 02:40:52,735
They could
shut us down and send us back to Auschwitz.

2064
02:40:55,824 --> 02:40:57,907
I'll call around
and find out where we can buy shells

2065
02:40:58,044 --> 02:40:58,874
and pass them off as ours.

2066
02:40:58,932 --> 02:40:59,956
I don't see the difference

2067
02:41:00,015 --> 02:41:01,268
whether they're made here or somewhere else

2068
02:41:01,327 --> 02:41:02,804
You
don't see a difference? I see a difference.

2069
02:41:02,862 --> 02:41:03,709
You'll lose a lot of money.

2070
02:41:03,766 --> 02:41:05,021
Fewer shells will be made.

2071
02:41:05,718 --> 02:41:07,443
Stern, if this factory ever produces

2072
02:41:07,503 --> 02:41:09,043
a shell that can actually be fired

2073
02:41:09,432 --> 02:41:10,637
I'll be very unhappy.

2074
02:41:12,541 --> 02:41:14,440
- Hello, madam
- How do you do.

2075
02:41:28,543 --> 02:41:29,459
How are you doing, Rabbi?

2076
02:41:30,691 --> 02:41:31,380
Rabbi

2077
02:41:34,822 --> 02:41:35,997
Good, Herr Direktor

2078
02:41:38,482 --> 02:41:39,444
The sun's going down.

2079
02:41:42,863 --> 02:41:43,987
Yes, it is.

2080
02:41:46,113 --> 02:41:46,852
What day is this?

2081
02:41:47,449 --> 02:41:48,008
Friday?

2082
02:41:48,579 --> 02:41:49,587
It is Friday, isn't it?

2083
02:41:49,892 --> 02:41:50,459
Is it?

2084
02:41:55,262 --> 02:41:56,381
What's the matter with you?

2085
02:41:56,912 --> 02:41:58,673
You should be preparing for the sabbath

2086
02:42:00,012 --> 02:42:00,765
shouldn't you?

2087
02:42:08,661 --> 02:42:09,717
I've got some wine

2088
02:42:10,963 --> 02:42:12,363
in my office. Come.

2089
02:43:25,072 --> 02:43:25,647
What?

2090
02:43:28,069 --> 02:43:29,097
Do you have any money

2091
02:43:31,552 --> 02:43:34,031
hidden away
some place that I don't know about?

2092
02:43:38,730 --> 02:43:39,203
No

2093
02:43:45,376 --> 02:43:46,893
Why? Am I broke?

2094
02:43:49,294 --> 02:43:50,031
Uh

2095
02:43:52,039 --> 02:43:52,883
well...

2096
02:43:55,175 --> 02:43:56,668
<i>Yesterday morning</i>

2097
02:43:57,388 --> 02:44:00,230
<i>at 2:41 a.m.</i>

2098
02:44:01,254 --> 02:44:04,059
<i>at General Eisenhower's headquarters</i>

2099
02:44:05,093 --> 02:44:06,616
<i>General Jodl</i>

2100
02:44:07,677 --> 02:44:11,195
<i>signed the Act of Unconditional Surrender</i>

2101
02:44:11,784 --> 02:44:16,956
<i>of all German
land, sea and air forces in Europe</i>

2102
02:44:17,738 --> 02:44:20,182
<i>to the Allied Expeditionary Force</i>

2103
02:44:21,414 --> 02:44:25,343
<i>and simultaneously to the Soviet High Command.</i>

2104
02:44:26,138 --> 02:44:28,626
<i>The German war is therefore at an end.</i>

2105
02:44:29,854 --> 02:44:31,741
<i>But let us not forget for a moment...</i>

2106
02:44:31,815 --> 02:44:34,709
I think
it's time, the guards came into the factory.

2107
02:44:36,107 --> 02:44:37,955
<i>Japan, with all her treachery...</i>

2108
02:44:39,173 --> 02:44:41,485
The unconditional surrender of Germany

2109
02:44:41,909 --> 02:44:42,918
has just been announced.

2110
02:44:44,613 --> 02:44:45,901
At midnight tonight

2111
02:44:46,462 --> 02:44:48,334
the war is over.

2112
02:44:51,012 --> 02:44:51,673
Tomorrow

2113
02:44:52,289 --> 02:44:55,471
you'll begin the process
of looking for survivors of your families.

2114
02:44:59,102 --> 02:45:00,268
In most cases

2115
02:45:02,532 --> 02:45:03,600
you won't find them.

2116
02:45:05,572 --> 02:45:07,469
After six long years of murder

2117
02:45:08,373 --> 02:45:10,620
victims
are being mourned throughout the world.

2118
02:45:13,573 --> 02:45:14,451
We've survived.

2119
02:45:16,733 --> 02:45:18,855
Many of you
have come up to me and thanked me.

2120
02:45:22,772 --> 02:45:23,908
Thank yourselves.

2121
02:45:26,096 --> 02:45:27,552
Thank your fearless Stern

2122
02:45:29,131 --> 02:45:31,177
and others among you who worried about you

2123
02:45:31,236 --> 02:45:32,723
and faced death at every moment.

2124
02:45:38,007 --> 02:45:39,694
I'm a member of the Nazi Party.

2125
02:45:40,811 --> 02:45:42,531
I'm a munitions manufacturer.

2126
02:45:43,731 --> 02:45:45,379
I'm a profiteer of slave labour.

2127
02:45:46,370 --> 02:45:47,049
I am

2128
02:45:47,722 --> 02:45:48,377
a criminal.

2129
02:45:50,090 --> 02:45:52,430
At midnight
you'll be free and I'll be hunted.

2130
02:45:55,455 --> 02:45:58,088
I shall remain
with you until five minutes after midnight

2131
02:45:58,850 --> 02:46:01,393
after which time,
and I hope you'll forgive me

2132
02:46:02,022 --> 02:46:02,971
I have to flee.

2133
02:46:06,770 --> 02:46:09,438
I know
you have received orders from our commandant

2134
02:46:10,410 --> 02:46:12,239
which he has received from his superiors

2135
02:46:12,299 --> 02:46:14,339
to dispose of the population of this camp.

2136
02:46:15,691 --> 02:46:17,111
Now would be the time to do it.

2137
02:46:17,890 --> 02:46:19,182
Here they are. They're all here.

2138
02:46:21,111 --> 02:46:22,389
This is your opportunity.

2139
02:46:27,379 --> 02:46:28,983
Or you could leave

2140
02:46:31,088 --> 02:46:32,875
and return to your families as men

2141
02:46:33,585 --> 02:46:34,614
instead of murderers.

2142
02:47:15,969 --> 02:47:18,477
In memory
of the countless victims among your people

2143
02:47:19,826 --> 02:47:22,207
I ask us to observe three minutes of silence.

2144
02:48:16,392 --> 02:48:17,267
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

2145
02:48:17,778 --> 02:48:18,888
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

2146
02:48:19,404 --> 02:48:20,645
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

2147
02:48:20,703 --> 02:48:21,803
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

2148
02:48:21,861 --> 02:48:22,450
Open wide.

2149
02:48:25,299 --> 02:48:26,496
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

2150
02:48:45,058 --> 02:48:46,319
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

2151
02:49:10,549 --> 02:49:12,948
As soon as peace occurs, I want

2152
02:49:15,326 --> 02:49:17,332
I want that cloth distributed to the workers:

2153
02:49:18,523 --> 02:49:19,718
2½ meters each.

2154
02:49:21,163 --> 02:49:23,320
Also,
each person is to get a bottle of vodka.

2155
02:49:24,402 --> 02:49:26,231
They won't drink it. They know its value.

2156
02:49:27,201 --> 02:49:29,523
Likewise
those Egipshi cigarettes we organized.

2157
02:49:30,683 --> 02:49:32,710
It'll be done, everything you ask.

2158
02:49:53,156 --> 02:49:54,194
We've written a letter

2159
02:49:54,879 --> 02:49:56,209
trying to explain things

2160
02:49:57,310 --> 02:49:58,594
in case you are captured.

2161
02:50:01,480 --> 02:50:03,038
Every worker has signed it.

2162
02:50:14,237 --> 02:50:15,191
Thank you.

2163
02:50:42,007 --> 02:50:43,927
It is Hebrew, from the Talmud.

2164
02:50:44,033 --> 02:50:47,411
It says, "Whoever
saves one life, saves the world entire."

2165
02:51:27,078 --> 02:51:28,923
I could have got more out.

2166
02:51:31,692 --> 02:51:32,933
I could have got more.

2167
02:51:33,460 --> 02:51:34,135
I don't know.

2168
02:51:34,225 --> 02:51:35,145
If I'd just...

2169
02:51:37,554 --> 02:51:38,558
I could have got more.

2170
02:51:38,617 --> 02:51:42,745
Oskar, there are 1,100 people
who are alive because of you. Look at them.

2171
02:51:44,290 --> 02:51:45,608
If I'd made more money...

2172
02:51:50,401 --> 02:51:53,426
I threw away so much money.

2173
02:51:57,052 --> 02:51:58,299
You have no idea.

2174
02:51:59,865 --> 02:52:00,799
If I had just...

2175
02:52:01,650 --> 02:52:04,129
There will be
generations because of what you did.

2176
02:52:05,870 --> 02:52:07,286
I didn't do enough.

2177
02:52:08,557 --> 02:52:09,658
You did so much.

2178
02:52:14,424 --> 02:52:15,344
This car:

2179
02:52:17,145 --> 02:52:18,584
Goeth would have bought this car.

2180
02:52:19,234 --> 02:52:20,582
Why did I keep the car?

2181
02:52:21,081 --> 02:52:22,598
10 people right there

2182
02:52:26,234 --> 02:52:27,222
10 people

2183
02:52:29,713 --> 02:52:30,650
10 more people.

2184
02:52:33,953 --> 02:52:34,740
This pin:

2185
02:52:35,662 --> 02:52:36,544
2 people.

2186
02:52:39,977 --> 02:52:40,775
This is gold:

2187
02:52:41,832 --> 02:52:42,719
2 more people.

2188
02:52:43,581 --> 02:52:45,710
He
would have given me 2 for it. At least one.

2189
02:52:46,576 --> 02:52:48,463
He would have given me one, one more

2190
02:52:52,058 --> 02:52:52,997
one more person

2191
02:52:56,173 --> 02:52:57,553
a person, Stern

2192
02:52:59,770 --> 02:53:00,495
for this.

2193
02:53:03,808 --> 02:53:06,555
I could have gotten

2194
02:53:07,353 --> 02:53:08,412
one more person

2195
02:53:09,537 --> 02:53:10,413
and I didn't

2196
02:53:12,201 --> 02:53:13,450
and I didn't.

2197
02:54:40,576 --> 02:54:42,549
You have been liberated

2198
02:54:43,257 --> 02:54:45,090
by the Soviet Army.

2199
02:54:53,424 --> 02:54:54,755
Have you been in Poland?

2200
02:54:55,222 --> 02:54:56,635
I just came from Poland.

2201
02:54:59,705 --> 02:55:00,760
Are there any jews left?

2202
02:55:07,264 --> 02:55:08,540
Where should we go?

2203
02:55:09,683 --> 02:55:11,683
Don't go east. That's for sure.

2204
02:55:11,838 --> 02:55:12,730
They hate you there.

2205
02:55:15,103 --> 02:55:17,232
I wouldn't go west either, if I were you.

2206
02:55:19,782 --> 02:55:21,162
We could use some food.

2207
02:55:24,247 --> 02:55:26,368
Isn't that a town over there?

2208
02:56:38,184 --> 02:56:39,074
Heil Hitler
