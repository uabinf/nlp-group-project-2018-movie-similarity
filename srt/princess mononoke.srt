00:00:29,293 --> 00:00:41,280
<i>In ancient times, Japan was
covered in deep forests, within
which lived the gods of old.</i>

3
00:01:25,007 --> 00:01:30,608
PRINCESS MONONOKE

4
00:01:43,446 --> 00:01:44,751
Yakkuru!

5
00:01:50,742 --> 00:01:51,731
Ashitaka!

6
00:01:52,577 --> 00:01:55,547
Good Timing. Hii-sama says
we should get back to the village.

7
00:01:55,613 --> 00:01:56,907
Jii-ji said the same thing.

8
00:01:56,961 --> 00:01:57,579
Jii-ji?

9
00:01:57,734 --> 00:01:59,156
He says the moutain isn't right!

10
00:01:59,195 --> 00:02:01,258
- And the birds have gone!
- And the animals, too!

11
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:06,016
I see.  I'll go see Jii-ji myself.
You three hurry back to the village.

12
00:02:43,861 --> 00:02:45,920
Something's coming...

13
00:02:52,744 --> 00:02:54,143
Jii-ji, what's up?

14
00:02:54,213 --> 00:02:56,647
I don't know. But it's not human.

15
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:59,505
Hii-sama's called everyone in.

16
00:03:00,645 --> 00:03:02,078
Here it comes...

17
00:03:31,323 --> 00:03:32,674
It's a tatari-gami!

18
00:03:32,793 --> 00:03:33,518
Tatari-gami?

19
00:03:54,232 --> 00:03:55,631
Yakkuru, run!

20
00:04:21,325 --> 00:04:23,953
It's headed to the village!

21
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:25,475
Ashitaka!

22
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:29,299
A tatari-gami is a cursed spirit!
Don't let it touch you!

23
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:31,532
Yakkuru!

24
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:56,850
Calm! You must calm yourself!

25
00:04:56,961 --> 00:05:01,728
O noble god of the forest!
What spurned this rampage?

26
00:05:18,282 --> 00:05:20,716
- A demon!
- Run!

27
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,166
Stop!

28
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,315
Why do you attack our village!

29
00:05:25,535 --> 00:05:27,435
Stop! Calm yourself!

30
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,947
- It's down!
- Ashitaka!

31
00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:33,450
- Bring Hii-sama!
- Keep the fires going!

32
00:06:35,126 --> 00:06:36,252
Ashitaka!

33
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:42,365
Kaya, don't touch it!
It's no ordinary wound!

34
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:45,425
Ashitaka is hurt! Where's Hii-sama?!

35
00:06:45,536 --> 00:06:48,198
Everybody, don't get any closer!

36
00:06:48,706 --> 00:06:49,832
Hii-sama!

37
00:06:49,907 --> 00:06:53,308
Pour this water, slowly,
over the wound.

38
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,141
Right.

39
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:10,749
O raging god from parts unknown...

40
00:07:10,828 --> 00:07:13,661
...l must respectfully speak to you now.

41
00:07:14,765 --> 00:07:19,327
Where you have fallen we will
raise a mound and perform rites.

42
00:07:19,403 --> 00:07:22,167
Bear us no hate, and be at peace.

43
00:07:23,808 --> 00:07:27,073
Foul humans...

44
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:32,006
...you shall feel my suffering,
and my hatred.

45
00:08:11,188 --> 00:08:14,589
The situation is grim.

46
00:08:14,658 --> 00:08:18,594
The boar came from a land
far to the west.

47
00:08:18,662 --> 00:08:22,758
He was wounded by something
that ate away at his flesh.

48
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:28,829
He ran, growing with pain and hatred,
until he became a tatari-gami.

49
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,176
My dear Ashitaka...

50
00:08:31,605 --> 00:08:32,280
Yes?

51
00:08:32,584 --> 00:08:34,916
Show everyone your right arm.

52
00:08:43,421 --> 00:08:44,410
Hii-sama!

53
00:08:45,757 --> 00:08:50,717
My dear Ashitaka, are you prepared
to accept your fate?

54
00:08:50,882 --> 00:08:51,641
Yes.

55
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:54,415
I accepted it the moment
I let loose my arrow.

56
00:08:56,768 --> 00:09:01,000
...that mark is a curse that
will seep into your bones and kill you.

57
00:09:05,777 --> 00:09:07,972
Hii-sama, what can we do?

58
00:09:08,046 --> 00:09:11,413
Ashitaka protected the girls
and saved the village!

59
00:09:11,482 --> 00:09:13,677
To sit and wait for death...

60
00:09:14,452 --> 00:09:17,012
You cannot change your fate.

61
00:09:17,088 --> 00:09:21,525
You can, though, rise to meet it.

62
00:09:21,593 --> 00:09:23,083
Look...

63
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:28,088
This was inside the boar's body.

64
00:09:28,766 --> 00:09:34,204
He was in agony. It shattered
his bones, tore at his entrails...

65
00:09:34,272 --> 00:09:38,106
...without it, he would not
have become a tatari-gami.

66
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:43,076
So what is happening in the weastern lands,
that a boar-god could be so injured?

67
00:09:43,147 --> 00:09:48,133
Perhaps by going west,
to see with eyes unclouded...

68
00:09:48,353 --> 00:09:52,187
...you may at least find answers.

69
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:57,022
For more than 500 years now,
our tribe has hidden in this place...

70
00:09:57,048 --> 00:10:01,187
...after our defeat in the war
against the Yamato regime.

71
00:10:01,232 --> 00:10:04,998
These days, we hear the influence
of the Yamato has withered...

72
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:08,835
...and even the Shogun's
samurai are losing control.

73
00:10:08,906 --> 00:10:13,570
...and yet with each generation,
our tribe also grows weaker.

74
00:10:14,112 --> 00:10:19,209
And now, bitter fate, the young man who
should have grown to be our chieftain...

75
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:22,481
...must journey far to the west.

76
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:42,729
The law forbids that we watch
as you go. Farewell.

77
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:13,896
Ashitaka!

78
00:11:13,971 --> 00:11:16,132
Kaya, you should not be here.

79
00:11:16,808 --> 00:11:20,642
I will accept punishment.
Please, take this to remember me by.

80
00:11:25,483 --> 00:11:27,383
But isn't this your beloved crystal dagger?

81
00:11:28,152 --> 00:11:30,484
I breathed a charm on it
to protect you.

82
00:11:30,555 --> 00:11:35,117
I will never forget you.
And maybe, some day...some day...

83
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:38,457
I'll always remember you, Kaya.

84
00:13:07,985 --> 00:13:09,247
Fighting?

85
00:13:17,962 --> 00:13:18,986
Move up!

86
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,793
Here's another one!

87
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:25,892
His head is mine!

88
00:13:36,514 --> 00:13:37,708
Stop!

89
00:13:45,957 --> 00:13:47,618
What is going on with my arm?

90
00:13:48,826 --> 00:13:51,260
Don't let him get away!

91
00:13:51,395 --> 00:13:53,829
I'm coming through! Let me pass!

92
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:10,269
Demon!

93
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:25,461
The mark is spreading...

94
00:14:36,807 --> 00:14:39,537
This soup is really terrible...

95
00:14:43,714 --> 00:14:45,705
There he is!

96
00:14:52,188 --> 00:14:53,450
Will this do?

97
00:14:53,524 --> 00:14:55,651
What the hell?
This isn't money!

98
00:14:56,327 --> 00:14:58,022
Give me back my rice!

99
00:14:58,596 --> 00:15:01,087
Just a moment, may I see that?

100
00:15:02,066 --> 00:15:03,328
Hm?!

101
00:15:03,401 --> 00:15:07,531
Woman, this is pure gold!

102
00:15:08,872 --> 00:15:13,304
Is it coins you want? I can pay you!

103
00:15:13,977 --> 00:15:17,640
Hey everyone, is there
a money house nearby?

104
00:15:17,715 --> 00:15:19,842
No?

105
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:23,346
I'm just a simple monk, but I'd say
this is worth a whole bag of rice!

106
00:15:23,372 --> 00:15:25,771
...no, three whole bags of rice!

107
00:15:25,823 --> 00:15:27,051
Wait, young sir!

108
00:15:27,124 --> 00:15:28,819
Hey, that's mine! Give it back!

109
00:15:29,693 --> 00:15:33,185
Hey! Don't be in such a rush!

110
00:15:33,913 --> 00:15:37,062
Now, now...there's no
need to thank me.

111
00:15:37,088 --> 00:15:39,638
It is I who should
be thanking you!

112
00:15:39,677 --> 00:15:43,807
You saved me back there
when those samurai attacked.

113
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:48,543
You fight like one possessed!

114
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:55,985
So you've spotted them... That's what
you get for flashing gold around.

115
00:15:56,687 --> 00:15:59,823
Indeed, people's hearts harden
and become rough like hemp.

116
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:04,494
It would be rather annoying to
be robbed in our sleep.  Shall we run?

117
00:16:14,737 --> 00:16:18,002
Oh...so the boar became a tatari-gami.

118
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:23,550
I followed the boar's trail back here,
but I lost it just outside the village.

119
00:16:23,813 --> 00:16:25,303
That's to be expected.

120
00:16:25,381 --> 00:16:27,042
Look over there.

121
00:16:27,784 --> 00:16:33,552
The last time I was here,
that was a village.

122
00:16:33,656 --> 00:16:38,025
There was a flood, maybe,
or a landslide. I'm sure many died.

123
00:16:39,696 --> 00:16:43,393
War, poverty, sickness, starvation...

124
00:16:43,466 --> 00:16:47,903
The land teems with those who
died swallowing their resentment.

125
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:52,168
You want to speak of curses?
This whole world is, in itself, a curse.

126
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,337
Ah, this is good!

127
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,016
I shouldn't have gotten involved
in the fighting. I killed two men.

128
00:17:02,084 --> 00:17:04,814
But you saved me.

129
00:17:04,888 --> 00:17:07,789
Give me your bowl.
You shall eat first.

130
00:17:07,857 --> 00:17:09,154
Everyone dies.

131
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:11,919
Some now, some later.

132
00:17:11,995 --> 00:17:14,657
Hmm, what an elegant bowl...

133
00:17:14,731 --> 00:17:19,168
You remind me of legends
of an acient people...

134
00:17:19,969 --> 00:17:22,767
...people who used stone arrowheads
and rode strange red elk.

135
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:26,400
They were the brave Emishi tribe,
said to live far off to the East.

136
00:17:33,015 --> 00:17:36,348
First, though,
avoid the jaws of death.

137
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:39,616
Or so my old teacher used to say.

138
00:17:39,689 --> 00:17:42,123
Eat up, it's your rice!

139
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:46,295
Would you know what this is?

140
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,789
This?

141
00:17:52,368 --> 00:17:57,772
It was in the body of the boar.
It's what gave him his wounds.

142
00:18:07,717 --> 00:18:10,914
As you travel west from here,
farther into the mountains...

143
00:18:10,987 --> 00:18:15,048
...there is a deep forest that
is not safe for humans to enter.

144
00:18:15,124 --> 00:18:16,751
This is the Shishi-Gami's forest.

145
00:18:16,826 --> 00:18:18,350
The Shishi-Gami's forest?

146
00:18:18,428 --> 00:18:23,422
They say the creatures there are giants,
just as they were in ancient times.

147
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,365
I knew it, he's going west.

148
00:19:31,496 --> 00:19:34,829
It's not far now!
Stay on your guard!

149
00:19:35,972 --> 00:19:37,371
Here they come!

150
00:19:37,481 --> 00:19:38,701
It's the wolves!

151
00:19:46,349 --> 00:19:49,807
Calm the oxen! Don't rush!
Form your ranks!

152
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,819
Keep your powder dry!

153
00:19:52,488 --> 00:19:54,319
Let them come in range!

154
00:20:01,864 --> 00:20:04,059
Number 1...Fire!

155
00:20:21,584 --> 00:20:23,745
Number 2...Fire!

156
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:32,655
They weren't much, as demons go.

157
00:20:32,728 --> 00:20:35,856
Those were just the pups.
Where's the mother?

158
00:20:42,905 --> 00:20:44,031
It's Moro!

159
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:51,937
Moro! Over here!

160
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:07,051
Got her!

161
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,463
She's a god.
She won't die from that.

162
00:21:18,407 --> 00:21:20,238
We took quite the beating.

163
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:21,742
We leave immediately.

164
00:21:21,811 --> 00:21:23,608
What about the ones who fell?

165
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,442
Form up and move out!

166
00:21:45,635 --> 00:21:46,932
He's breathing!

167
00:21:47,837 --> 00:21:49,168
Hang on!

168
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:55,536
I am Ashitaka! I have come
from far to the east!

169
00:22:55,605 --> 00:22:59,234
Are you the ancient gods said
to live in the Shishi-Gami's forest?

170
00:23:15,725 --> 00:23:16,817
Leave!

171
00:23:37,113 --> 00:23:39,775
A kodama...?  So kodama
live in these forests as well.

172
00:23:42,051 --> 00:23:44,645
Keep still, or you'll make
your wounds worse.

173
00:23:49,992 --> 00:23:53,985
If you leave them be, the are harmless.
They're a sign of a healthy forest.

174
00:23:54,063 --> 00:23:56,156
But they might call the Shishi-Gami.

175
00:23:56,232 --> 00:23:58,601
Shishi-Gami?  You mean like a large wolf?

176
00:23:58,734 --> 00:24:02,636
No, something much worse!
A demon lord!

177
00:24:05,107 --> 00:24:06,506
It's gone!

178
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,078
Yakkuru's not afraid.
There's no danger here.

179
00:24:17,719 --> 00:24:21,382
We beg passage
through your woods.

180
00:24:33,235 --> 00:24:35,032
Let's go back! Please!

181
00:24:35,904 --> 00:24:40,102
There's a trail across the river.
We'll never get through these woods!

182
00:24:40,643 --> 00:24:42,975
The current's too strong.

183
00:24:43,045 --> 00:24:46,606
And this man's wounds are serious.
We have to move quickly.

184
00:24:51,987 --> 00:24:55,423
So are you guiding us?
Or leading us astray?

185
00:25:10,072 --> 00:25:14,133
Sir! These things
are not helping us get home...

186
00:25:14,209 --> 00:25:16,006
...and more and more
of them keep appearing!

187
00:25:35,998 --> 00:25:39,866
This is your mother? A fine tree!

188
00:26:21,009 --> 00:26:25,412
The tracks of that girl and those wolves...
Is this their domain?

189
00:26:26,014 --> 00:26:30,849
Sir, this really is dangerous.
This is the gate to another world!

190
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:32,944
I think you're right.
I'll only be a moment.

191
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,028
Tracks...

192
00:26:52,174 --> 00:26:56,372
Three toes...and still fresh.

193
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:51,459
S-sir! What's wrong?

194
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:28,796
Are you all right, sir?
Your face has gone white...

195
00:28:29,872 --> 00:28:31,641
...do you feel it, too?

196
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,453
Did you see that just now?

197
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,666
- What?
- No, never mind...

198
00:28:36,979 --> 00:28:39,743
We're almost there.  Just hold on.

199
00:28:39,815 --> 00:28:41,578
Thank you.

200
00:28:47,956 --> 00:28:49,753
It's gone...

201
00:28:52,027 --> 00:28:55,622
Strange...this man
feels less heavy now...

202
00:28:55,731 --> 00:28:58,632
Hey! It doesn't hurt!

203
00:29:00,035 --> 00:29:02,503
It's healed! ...ow!
No, no, it's still broken.

204
00:29:08,143 --> 00:29:12,477
Sir! You were right!
We've arrived at Tatara Ba!

205
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,011
It's a fort!

206
00:29:46,081 --> 00:29:48,242
That's Lady Eboshi's ironworks.

207
00:29:48,317 --> 00:29:51,309
We melt iron and make steel!

208
00:29:51,753 --> 00:29:53,084
Hey!

209
00:29:54,122 --> 00:29:56,113
Hey!

210
00:29:57,259 --> 00:30:00,194
- Something's coming from the woods!
- Is it the Mononoke?

211
00:30:01,028 --> 00:30:04,464
It's me! Koroku the ox-driver!

212
00:30:05,122 --> 00:30:08,461
- Kouroku? Is it a ghost?
- Someone find his wife!

213
00:30:08,603 --> 00:30:10,888
It's true! He's crossing
the lake right now!

214
00:30:11,183 --> 00:30:12,498
You're sure it's him?

215
00:30:12,606 --> 00:30:17,270
What's all this noise?!
Be quiet when I'm writing!

216
00:30:17,346 --> 00:30:20,110
Koruku's come back from the dead!

217
00:30:20,182 --> 00:30:21,240
What?!

218
00:30:33,328 --> 00:30:35,125
You're not a ghost.

219
00:30:35,197 --> 00:30:38,189
- Where are the others?
- Four of you fell...

220
00:30:38,734 --> 00:30:40,258
Only the two of us were saved.

221
00:30:43,505 --> 00:30:45,837
The ones that die
are always the ox-drivers...

222
00:30:45,907 --> 00:30:47,238
Move!

223
00:30:47,843 --> 00:30:51,301
Who's the man in the hood, sir?

224
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,904
I've no idea...

225
00:30:54,282 --> 00:31:00,187
Gunner troops, listen to me...this man
carried your comrade on his back!

226
00:31:00,255 --> 00:31:01,984
Thank him.

227
00:31:02,424 --> 00:31:05,882
Ow! Don't grab me there!

228
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:09,930
Hey, you! Wait!

229
00:31:21,717 --> 00:31:24,550
First, my thanks
for bringing back our men.

230
00:31:24,646 --> 00:31:27,137
But the situation is suspicious...

231
00:31:27,214 --> 00:31:30,809
You show up less than an hour
after our own party.

232
00:31:30,886 --> 00:31:34,117
And you emerged from the
Shishi-Gami's forest, carrying...huh?

233
00:31:34,189 --> 00:31:36,521
Koroku! You're alive!

234
00:31:36,591 --> 00:31:38,183
Toki!

235
00:31:39,766 --> 00:31:40,960
What is this!?

236
00:31:41,569 --> 00:31:42,760
Good for nothing!

237
00:31:42,852 --> 00:31:45,755
An ox-driver with a broken leg?
How are we supposed to eat?

238
00:31:45,801 --> 00:31:47,029
But...but...

239
00:31:47,102 --> 00:31:50,970
You're always making me worry.
Maybe the wolves should've eaten you!

240
00:31:51,073 --> 00:31:53,337
Then I could find a better husband!

241
00:31:53,408 --> 00:31:56,206
Toki! Please forgive me!

242
00:31:56,311 --> 00:31:59,178
Toki, save your domestic squabbling
for some other time.

243
00:32:00,315 --> 00:32:02,784
And you! Leaving them there to die!

244
00:32:02,917 --> 00:32:06,614
Some escort you are!
You don't do any real work here.

245
00:32:06,687 --> 00:32:08,678
Put yourself in harm's way
once in a while!

246
00:32:08,756 --> 00:32:10,724
It couldn't be helped...

247
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:14,227
Thank you. My husband's an idiot,
but I'm glad he's safe.

248
00:32:14,836 --> 00:32:18,397
Oh, good. I was afraid maybe
I shouldn't have brought him back.

249
00:32:22,671 --> 00:32:26,598
Hey, I bet you are handsome.
Let's see your face!

250
00:32:26,674 --> 00:32:27,868
Gonza...

251
00:32:29,043 --> 00:32:33,104
He may stay and rest.  Later on,
I'd like to thank him personally.

252
00:32:33,181 --> 00:32:34,170
Koroku...

253
00:32:35,683 --> 00:32:38,709
It's good you're back. I'm so sorry.

254
00:32:39,753 --> 00:32:44,156
Don't say that, Lady Eboshi!
He's already so spoiled.

255
00:32:44,892 --> 00:32:49,158
Forgive me, Toki. I was there,
and I failed to save him.

256
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:52,271
Oh no, without you
watching over all our men...

257
00:32:52,297 --> 00:32:55,145
...they'd all be resting comfortably
in the pit of the wolves' stomachs!

258
00:32:56,094 --> 00:32:57,482
-So true!
-No mistake!

259
00:32:57,605 --> 00:33:00,904
Go and rest, traveler.

260
00:33:05,746 --> 00:33:07,976
Hey! I was right!

261
00:33:35,576 --> 00:33:38,909
We had to fight off Moro herself
to bring back this rice!

262
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,470
Hurry up!

263
00:33:42,048 --> 00:33:43,777
Where is he?

264
00:33:43,885 --> 00:33:45,409
Is that Him?

265
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,851
Toki was right!

266
00:33:47,922 --> 00:33:49,890
- He is handsome!
- He's a bit young...

267
00:33:49,991 --> 00:33:52,653
Oh, that never stopped you before!

268
00:33:53,327 --> 00:33:55,625
Quiet out there!
We lost two men today!

269
00:33:55,695 --> 00:33:57,890
But if you want good looking men,
look no further!

270
00:33:57,999 --> 00:34:00,024
You kidding? You lot?

271
00:34:00,101 --> 00:34:04,936
Hey Traveler, come over to our place!
Forget this pig sty!

272
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,635
Hey! We risk our lives for the rice
you eat.  Show some respect!

273
00:34:09,744 --> 00:34:12,975
And who made the steel
that bought that rice?

274
00:34:13,047 --> 00:34:15,413
We work those bellows
all night long!

275
00:34:16,284 --> 00:34:19,412
I would like to see where you work,
if you don't mind...

276
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:20,508
Really?

277
00:34:20,588 --> 00:34:22,783
We'll have to dress up!

278
00:34:22,857 --> 00:34:24,518
And wear makeup!

279
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:28,494
Don't forget! We'll be waiting!

280
00:34:29,864 --> 00:34:32,765
Don't mind them, sir.

281
00:34:33,868 --> 00:34:36,486
Lady Eboshi spoils them.

282
00:34:36,564 --> 00:34:38,772
I've heard healthy women
make a healthy village.

283
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,568
But...women of that sort,
living in Tatara Ba?

284
00:34:42,643 --> 00:34:45,510
We shouldn't have them around.
Their presence defiles the steel.

285
00:34:46,013 --> 00:34:50,211
Lady Eboshi brings back all
the working girls she can find.

286
00:34:50,284 --> 00:34:52,411
She's kind, that's all.

287
00:34:52,485 --> 00:34:54,453
Keep your rice in your mouth, old man.

288
00:34:54,522 --> 00:34:58,652
But she's also hard as nails! She's
picked more than one fight with demons!

289
00:34:58,725 --> 00:35:01,660
That's right, the wolves are nothing.

290
00:35:01,729 --> 00:35:04,562
You should've seen her bring down Nago!

291
00:35:04,632 --> 00:35:05,737
Nago?

292
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,531
A massive boar!
He was a terrifying presence!

293
00:35:09,637 --> 00:35:12,606
...and he wouldn't let us near the mountains.

294
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,911
Moutains full of trees and ore!
Just sitting there!

295
00:35:17,311 --> 00:35:19,779
Yeah, we'd used up the ironsand
from the lower reaches...

296
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:25,112
We all wanted at those mountains!
But there was no way!

297
00:35:25,186 --> 00:35:29,054
Even so, we needed trees, so
we kept pushing further out...

298
00:35:29,557 --> 00:35:31,081
...and then Nago struck.

299
00:35:47,675 --> 00:35:49,506
Oh, there he goes again!

300
00:35:51,879 --> 00:35:55,542
That's when Lady Eboshi
and the gun troops stepped in!

301
00:36:22,877 --> 00:36:24,640
Sir? What's wrong?

302
00:36:28,215 --> 00:36:30,115
Does your arm hurt?

303
00:36:30,207 --> 00:36:33,199
No, I was just thinking about Nago...

304
00:36:33,521 --> 00:36:36,888
He must have died full of hate.

305
00:36:43,097 --> 00:36:45,964
Ashitaka, or whoever you are,
I'm sorry for keeping you waiting.

306
00:36:46,033 --> 00:36:47,625
...this is fine.

307
00:36:48,102 --> 00:36:50,764
There is so much to do before
the morning shipment goes out.

308
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,729
Let's take a break.
Please let everyone know.

309
00:36:55,854 --> 00:36:56,954
Sure.

310
00:36:57,344 --> 00:37:00,973
Some suspect you are a spy.
Perhaps for the samurai, or Mononoke.

311
00:37:02,183 --> 00:37:05,175
Tatara Ba's success
brings a lot of attention.

312
00:37:05,252 --> 00:37:07,220
May I ask why you're here?

313
00:37:13,694 --> 00:37:15,594
I believe this iron is yours.

314
00:37:16,597 --> 00:37:19,478
It shattered the bones and tore
the flesh of a giant boar.

315
00:37:19,517 --> 00:37:21,582
...turning him into a tatari-gami.

316
00:37:22,269 --> 00:37:25,217
And when I finally killed him,
he gave me this mark.

317
00:37:25,771 --> 00:37:27,129
It will slowly kill me.

318
00:37:27,675 --> 00:37:31,076
Where are you from?
You ride a strange beast...

319
00:37:31,979 --> 00:37:35,415
Between north and east.
Beyond that I cannot say.

320
00:37:35,483 --> 00:37:39,476
You will answer her question,
or I'll cut you down!

321
00:37:39,987 --> 00:37:42,421
And if I tell you about that ball of iron,
what would you do?

322
00:37:43,858 --> 00:37:46,326
I will see with eyes unclouded.
And decide.

323
00:37:47,161 --> 00:37:49,152
'Eyes unclouded'?

324
00:37:54,001 --> 00:37:55,366
I see.

325
00:37:55,436 --> 00:37:57,870
I will show you my secret.
Follow me.

326
00:37:57,938 --> 00:37:59,166
Lady Eboshi...?

327
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,140
Gonza, please continue without me.

328
00:39:02,336 --> 00:39:05,032
My garden, where none dare come.

329
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:07,971
My secret is just ahead,
if you still want to know it.

330
00:39:16,183 --> 00:39:17,616
Good evening.

331
00:39:25,025 --> 00:39:27,493
Here's one we just finished!

332
00:39:28,996 --> 00:39:30,327
It's still heavy.

333
00:39:30,397 --> 00:39:32,991
And yet you hold it so lightly...

334
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,001
Too light, and it will fall apart!

335
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:40,904
It's not just for me... I intend for
the other women to carry them as well.

336
00:39:41,508 --> 00:39:43,339
Won't that be a sight!

337
00:39:43,444 --> 00:39:47,210
These people here designed
and built this new gun for me.

338
00:39:47,281 --> 00:39:49,340
The Chinese ones are heavy
and hard to use.

339
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:53,349
With these, we can take on anyone,
be they demons or samurai.

340
00:39:53,988 --> 00:39:57,719
Scary, scary!  Our Lady Eboshi
is ready to conquer the world!

341
00:39:58,634 --> 00:40:01,924
I'm sorry to rush you.
I'll have some sake sent up.

342
00:40:01,996 --> 00:40:03,563
That'll be splendid!

343
00:40:05,398 --> 00:40:09,266
So ravaging the forests and turning
boar-gods into tatari-gami isn't enough?

344
00:40:09,335 --> 00:40:12,498
You would birth a whole new
era of hatred and suffering?

345
00:40:13,573 --> 00:40:15,666
I regret that you suffer.

346
00:40:15,741 --> 00:40:18,574
I fired that shot.

347
00:40:19,053 --> 00:40:22,511
That foolish boar... if someone was
to be cursed, it should have been me.

348
00:40:40,366 --> 00:40:43,233
Your right arm seems
to be trying to kill me...

349
00:40:43,903 --> 00:40:46,303
If I thought it would lift my curse,
I would let it.

350
00:40:46,372 --> 00:40:48,806
But I don't believe it would
stop with just you.

351
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:52,377
Must it kill us all to be at peace?

352
00:40:52,445 --> 00:40:56,779
Lady Eboshi, our elder wishes to speak.

353
00:40:57,183 --> 00:41:01,984
Lady Eboshi, do not scorn
the young man's strength.

354
00:41:03,055 --> 00:41:06,957
Young man, I also carry a curse.

355
00:41:07,026 --> 00:41:10,553
So I can sympathize
with your grief and your rage.

356
00:41:10,663 --> 00:41:15,566
...yet I beg you
not to kill this woman.

357
00:41:15,635 --> 00:41:21,596
She is the only one
who looked upon us as human.

358
00:41:22,541 --> 00:41:25,169
Without fear of our disease...

359
00:41:25,244 --> 00:41:29,806
...she washed our rotting flesh,
tended to our bandages...

360
00:41:32,751 --> 00:41:33,877
Elder?

361
00:41:33,953 --> 00:41:37,582
Life is suffering. Life is hard.

362
00:41:37,689 --> 00:41:42,388
Curse this world, curse humanity,
and yet we all still wish to live...

363
00:41:42,483 --> 00:41:45,111
Please consider my
humble words...

364
00:42:04,684 --> 00:42:06,345
They're back.

365
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:11,786
At night they come to plant trees
and take back the mountain.

366
00:42:11,891 --> 00:42:15,258
Ashitaka, would you consider
staying here to help us?

367
00:42:16,195 --> 00:42:18,629
Do you intend to invade
the Shishi-Gami's forest?

368
00:42:18,731 --> 00:42:23,191
Without ancient gods, even
the Mononoke will become simple beasts.

369
00:42:23,703 --> 00:42:28,716
If we cut light into the forest, and tame
the wolves, this shall be a bountiful land.

370
00:42:28,793 --> 00:42:30,731
Princess Mononoke may even
become human again.

371
00:42:31,877 --> 00:42:32,866
Who?

372
00:42:33,479 --> 00:42:36,880
A lost girl whose heart
was stolen by the wolves.

373
00:42:36,949 --> 00:42:39,247
She lives to kill me.

374
00:42:44,824 --> 00:42:48,590
I have heard that the blood of
the Shishi-Gami can cure any illness.

375
00:42:48,661 --> 00:42:54,099
It could cure these lepers...
and perhaps your curse as well...

376
00:42:54,166 --> 00:42:58,034
Lady Eboshi, what do you think?

377
00:42:58,537 --> 00:43:01,686
Well done. Just right
to conquer the world!

378
00:43:01,756 --> 00:43:03,776
...but it is still too heavy.

379
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,434
Ha, ha! Scary, scary!

380
00:43:33,248 --> 00:43:34,464
You made it!

381
00:43:34,974 --> 00:43:36,942
Toki, may I give it a try?

382
00:43:37,009 --> 00:43:38,806
Huh? Hey, wait!

383
00:43:41,714 --> 00:43:43,204
May I try?

384
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:46,711
He's come all this way...let him try!

385
00:43:53,463 --> 00:43:55,463
What strength!

386
00:43:59,098 --> 00:44:01,293
Hey, he's here!

387
00:44:01,367 --> 00:44:03,301
See? Handsome, right?

388
00:44:03,368 --> 00:44:06,462
Quick, fix your robe before it falls off!

389
00:44:07,506 --> 00:44:09,701
You'll never keep that pace.

390
00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:12,076
It's hard work.

391
00:44:12,178 --> 00:44:14,840
Yep. And shifts run
for five days and nights.

392
00:44:15,648 --> 00:44:17,445
Is life hard here?

393
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:22,180
Yeah, but it's better than
the lives we used to have!

394
00:44:22,254 --> 00:44:25,951
We get to eat our fill,
and the men know their place!

395
00:44:26,525 --> 00:44:27,856
I see...

396
00:45:13,258 --> 00:45:14,583
You're leaving tomorrow?

397
00:45:14,634 --> 00:45:15,932
You should stay longer!

398
00:45:15,975 --> 00:45:17,567
You could work here!

399
00:45:17,643 --> 00:45:20,806
Thank you, but there is someone
I must meet.

400
00:45:27,353 --> 00:45:28,513
She's coming!

401
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,884
It's Princess Mononoke!

402
00:46:13,766 --> 00:46:14,755
It's her!

403
00:46:15,734 --> 00:46:17,258
Stop!

404
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:19,203
I don't want to fight you!

405
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:26,050
She's heading to the Hall!

406
00:46:26,204 --> 00:46:27,880
None of the wolves got in!

407
00:46:37,156 --> 00:46:41,388
Build up the fires! Gunners to
the stockade! Keep her inside!

408
00:46:41,493 --> 00:46:44,690
Stay at your posts!
Stay Alert!

409
00:46:45,264 --> 00:46:47,596
She's up on the roof!.

410
00:46:47,665 --> 00:46:50,498
Don't get excited! Keep working!

411
00:46:50,569 --> 00:46:52,196
The fire mustn't go out!

412
00:46:53,305 --> 00:46:57,071
- Is she alone?
- Yes. We have her cornered.

413
00:46:57,141 --> 00:46:59,371
I assume she's come
for you, Lady Eboshi.

414
00:46:59,445 --> 00:47:01,777
It can't be helped...follow me!

415
00:47:10,589 --> 00:47:14,286
Princess Mononoke.
Can you hear me?  I'm right here.

416
00:47:15,661 --> 00:47:17,925
If you would take revenge upon us...

417
00:47:18,831 --> 00:47:22,995
...here are some who seek
vengeance for husbands...

418
00:47:23,068 --> 00:47:25,161
...killed by wolves.

419
00:47:25,237 --> 00:47:27,728
Come on out!
We have a score to settle!

420
00:47:37,883 --> 00:47:39,612
There she is!

421
00:47:42,688 --> 00:47:45,919
Out of the way!
You're in the line of fire!

422
00:47:52,731 --> 00:47:54,596
It's a trap! Stop!

423
00:47:55,733 --> 00:47:58,265
Princess of the Wolves!
Return to the woods!

424
00:47:58,348 --> 00:47:59,435
Don't die for nothing!

425
00:48:03,208 --> 00:48:05,904
To survive is also courage!
Go home to your forest!

426
00:48:06,678 --> 00:48:07,975
I knew it!

427
00:48:08,047 --> 00:48:10,277
Let him do as he likes.

428
00:48:31,136 --> 00:48:33,400
Got her! She's falling!

429
00:48:33,472 --> 00:48:34,905
Stay back!

430
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:37,831
Even cut off, a wolf's head can still bite.

431
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:41,774
Aim where she falls.

432
00:49:00,466 --> 00:49:01,990
Fire!

433
00:49:10,542 --> 00:49:12,373
Stay back!

434
00:49:21,235 --> 00:49:22,224
Get up!

435
00:49:27,993 --> 00:49:29,153
Wait!

436
00:49:48,714 --> 00:49:51,578
She's trapped now!
Don't let her escape!

437
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:52,844
Kill her!

438
00:49:56,588 --> 00:49:58,749
Are you all right, sir?

439
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,532
Don't worry about me, go!

440
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:19,401
You...you're Mononoke, too!

441
00:50:22,214 --> 00:50:23,374
Halt!

442
00:50:27,452 --> 00:50:28,851
Please step aside.

443
00:50:45,804 --> 00:50:47,829
What are you doing, Ashitaka?!

444
00:50:47,906 --> 00:50:49,703
I'm taking this girl.

445
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:53,671
I'm sure she'll make a lovely wife.

446
00:50:54,179 --> 00:50:57,273
There is a demon inside you.
It's inside her, as well.

447
00:51:02,988 --> 00:51:03,748
Look on this!

448
00:51:03,774 --> 00:51:07,848
 It is the manifestation of the hatred
that haunts my cursed body!

449
00:51:08,327 --> 00:51:10,727
It rots my flesh, and ushers me
towards death!

450
00:51:11,964 --> 00:51:13,761
Do not foster such
hatred anymore!

451
00:51:13,865 --> 00:51:16,891
Don't push your misfortunes on us.

452
00:51:16,969 --> 00:51:18,561
I'll take care of that arm for you...

453
00:51:23,816 --> 00:51:25,336
Lady Eboshi!

454
00:51:28,113 --> 00:51:29,842
Someone come and take her.

455
00:51:36,021 --> 00:51:38,683
Don't worry. She'll wake up shortly.

456
00:51:43,762 --> 00:51:45,753
The girl leaves with me.

457
00:51:46,632 --> 00:51:49,795
Wait! I won't let you leave!
Why did you hurt Lady Eboshi like that!

458
00:51:53,005 --> 00:51:54,165
Don't move!

459
00:52:06,218 --> 00:52:07,879
Kiyo, stop it!

460
00:52:13,285 --> 00:52:14,723
How does he still walk?

461
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,828
- What about Lady Eboshi?
- Sh-she's fine!

462
00:52:23,903 --> 00:52:27,999
Bring me my gun!
Gunners, assemble here!

463
00:52:28,073 --> 00:52:29,665
They won't get away!

464
00:52:31,177 --> 00:52:32,838
Toki, quick!

465
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:39,781
Ashitaka?

466
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,495
Please, we can't let you pass.

467
00:52:57,036 --> 00:52:59,561
We will not raise this gate.

468
00:53:03,142 --> 00:53:04,609
Turn back, please...

469
00:53:04,675 --> 00:53:07,938
We are greatful for your help.
We don't want you as an enemy.

470
00:53:08,026 --> 00:53:08,803
We beg you...

471
00:53:09,481 --> 00:53:13,474
I entered this morning on my own two feet.
Now I shall leave the same way.

472
00:53:14,954 --> 00:53:17,787
What are you doing?  It takes
ten men to open that gate!

473
00:53:25,831 --> 00:53:27,799
Sir, no! You're killing yourself!

474
00:53:37,312 --> 00:53:38,432
It moved!

475
00:53:45,484 --> 00:53:47,281
Move aside!

476
00:53:51,123 --> 00:53:52,556
Wolves!

477
00:53:52,625 --> 00:53:53,649
Fire, I need fire!

478
00:53:54,193 --> 00:53:56,661
Stop! Your princess is safe!

479
00:53:59,665 --> 00:54:00,996
I'm coming out now!

480
00:54:01,066 --> 00:54:02,465
Yakkuru, let's go!

481
00:54:07,373 --> 00:54:08,863
I thank you.

482
00:54:15,748 --> 00:54:17,147
He's gone...

483
00:54:40,205 --> 00:54:41,365
Wait!

484
00:54:43,208 --> 00:54:44,835
That one's mine.

485
00:54:56,355 --> 00:54:59,950
They attacked you?
Are you going to die?

486
00:55:03,729 --> 00:55:06,960
Why did you interfere?!
Speak while you still live!

487
00:55:08,834 --> 00:55:11,496
I couldn't let you die...

488
00:55:11,603 --> 00:55:15,733
I'm not afraid to die!  If it would
stop the humans, I would happily die!

489
00:55:16,542 --> 00:55:19,238
I could see that in your eyes
when I first saw you.

490
00:55:19,345 --> 00:55:22,781
And now your meddling
will cost you your life!

491
00:55:26,852 --> 00:55:30,015
Cutting your throat should
stop you from saying stupid things.

492
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:32,479
You must survive...

493
00:55:32,591 --> 00:55:35,151
Shut up!  I don't take orders from humans!

494
00:55:37,096 --> 00:55:39,587
You are beautiful...

495
00:55:43,002 --> 00:55:46,699
What's wrong, San?
Shall I snap his neck?

496
00:55:58,684 --> 00:56:00,015
Apes?!

497
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:05,789
Apes! Do you mean disrespect
to the tribe of Moro?

498
00:56:06,792 --> 00:56:08,987
This is our forest.

499
00:56:09,061 --> 00:56:11,222
Give us human.

500
00:56:11,296 --> 00:56:14,663
Give us human and go.

501
00:56:14,733 --> 00:56:17,065
Leave, before my fangs find you.

502
00:56:17,569 --> 00:56:19,230
Go, go...

503
00:56:19,304 --> 00:56:21,534
We eat man.

504
00:56:21,707 --> 00:56:23,072
We eat the human.

505
00:56:23,575 --> 00:56:25,304
Let us eat the man.

506
00:56:25,377 --> 00:56:29,609
Noble Apes...are you not
the guardians of the forest?

507
00:56:29,681 --> 00:56:32,047
Why would you wish to eat a human?

508
00:56:32,651 --> 00:56:37,088
We eat human. We receive his power.

509
00:56:37,156 --> 00:56:40,592
We need power to drive humans
away. So we eat.

510
00:56:40,692 --> 00:56:45,254
It won't work! Such power
will not come from eating humans!

511
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:49,323
Eating humans will taint your blood!
You will destroy yourselves!

512
00:56:49,835 --> 00:56:53,857
We planted trees.
We plant and we plant.

513
00:56:53,927 --> 00:56:56,989
Humans rip it up.
Forest not return.

514
00:56:57,083 --> 00:56:58,862
We kill humans.

515
00:56:59,511 --> 00:57:03,607
The Shishi-Gami is with us.
Keep planting the trees!

516
00:57:03,682 --> 00:57:05,843
The Moro tribe will fight
alongside you until the end!

517
00:57:06,418 --> 00:57:10,445
Shishi-Gami will not fight.
We all die.

518
00:57:10,522 --> 00:57:13,855
Wolf girl not care.
Wolf girl is human.

519
00:57:15,527 --> 00:57:19,019
You insolent monkey!
I shall break your neck!

520
00:57:22,134 --> 00:57:23,465
Stop it!

521
00:57:32,144 --> 00:57:33,941
I'm fine, don't worry about me...

522
00:57:34,012 --> 00:57:38,142
You go ahead. I'll deal
with the human.

523
00:57:38,217 --> 00:57:40,708
What about that one?
Can we eat him?

524
00:57:44,456 --> 00:57:46,981
No, you can't. Now, get going.

525
00:57:54,399 --> 00:57:56,799
Come here. Let's make peace.

526
00:57:57,469 --> 00:58:00,529
Please.  I'll need your help
to carry your master.

527
00:59:56,121 --> 01:00:00,057
You're smart. You know
not to set foot on this island.

528
01:00:01,627 --> 01:00:03,117
I stink of human...

529
01:00:13,205 --> 01:00:15,867
Go where you like,
and live as you please.

530
01:01:48,167 --> 01:01:49,964
There he is!

531
01:01:50,803 --> 01:01:53,636
The Daidarabotchi! At last!

532
01:01:54,139 --> 01:01:55,629
Quick! Come and look!

533
01:01:56,575 --> 01:01:59,601
This is whole reason we've been
wearing these stinking pelts!

534
01:02:00,346 --> 01:02:02,312
If you look at the Shishi-Gami,
you will go blind!

535
01:02:02,981 --> 01:02:05,882
And yet you consider yourselves
among the best hunters in the west?

536
01:02:05,951 --> 01:02:08,749
Have you not seen our orders,
signed by the Emporer himself?

537
01:02:08,821 --> 01:02:11,551
We have permission to exterminate
the Shishi-Gami! So move!

538
01:02:17,329 --> 01:02:20,264
The Daidarabotchi is
the Shishi-Gami's nighttime form.

539
01:02:20,332 --> 01:02:23,096
Very soon it should turn back...

540
01:02:23,168 --> 01:02:25,373
This is the Shishi-Gami's den.

541
01:02:25,622 --> 01:02:27,596
Oh, it's vanishing...look!

542
01:03:50,289 --> 01:03:51,483
Jiko!

543
01:03:51,557 --> 01:03:53,286
I know.

544
01:03:54,092 --> 01:03:55,582
Over there...

545
01:04:08,807 --> 01:04:11,173
There's hundreds of them.

546
01:04:11,243 --> 01:04:13,643
They're not from these woods.

547
01:04:13,712 --> 01:04:16,078
But each is a renowned lord
from other mountains.

548
01:04:23,856 --> 01:04:25,824
It's Okkoto of Chinzei island!

549
01:04:25,891 --> 01:04:28,621
Chinzei? Are you saying he crossed the sea?

550
01:04:28,694 --> 01:04:30,719
There's no mistaking those tusks.

551
01:04:31,530 --> 01:04:33,964
And the bastard brought his
whole tribe with him!

552
01:04:37,102 --> 01:04:39,093
We're discovered! Fall back, quickly!

553
01:04:52,517 --> 01:04:54,678
Come on! Jump! Jump!

554
01:05:48,073 --> 01:05:49,836
My wound is gone!

555
01:06:00,052 --> 01:06:01,383
Yakkuru...

556
01:06:24,876 --> 01:06:29,142
If you're awake, thank Yakkuru.
He watched you the whole time.

557
01:06:31,083 --> 01:06:32,914
How do you know his name?

558
01:06:33,952 --> 01:06:39,049
He's told me all about you,
your village, your forest...

559
01:06:39,825 --> 01:06:43,488
The Shishi-Gami brought you
back to life, so I will help you.

560
01:06:45,163 --> 01:06:48,860
I had a strange dream...a golden deer...

561
01:06:48,934 --> 01:06:50,094
Eat.

562
01:06:55,574 --> 01:06:56,563
Chew.

563
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:30,096
We're here to kill the humans
and save the forest.

564
01:08:30,169 --> 01:08:32,103
Why are there humans here?

565
01:08:32,205 --> 01:08:34,673
The girl is San, my daughter.

566
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:40,337
The humans are everywhere. Go back
to your mountain and kill them there.

567
01:08:41,047 --> 01:08:44,574
We kill for the forest
of the Shishi-Gami.

568
01:08:44,650 --> 01:08:47,050
Why are there humans here?

569
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:51,756
The Shishi-Gami healed this man.
Therefore we will not kill him.

570
01:08:51,858 --> 01:08:57,296
The Shishi-Gami saved him?
The Shishi-Gami healed his wounds?!

571
01:08:58,331 --> 01:09:01,266
Why did he not save Nago?

572
01:09:01,367 --> 01:09:04,768
Is the Shishi-Gami not
the guardian of the forest?!

573
01:09:04,871 --> 01:09:09,103
The Shishi-Gami not only gives life,
he also takes it away.

574
01:09:09,175 --> 01:09:12,872
Have you boars forgotten even that?

575
01:09:13,379 --> 01:09:17,602
No, the wolves monopolize the Shishi-Gami!
You pull his attention from the rest of us!

576
01:09:17,650 --> 01:09:19,641
And by not saving Nago,
you've betrayed us!

577
01:09:20,286 --> 01:09:24,484
Nago feared his own death...
...and I now understand...

578
01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:28,822
...as I carry inside me
a similar poison stone.

579
01:09:28,895 --> 01:09:33,354
Nago fled, but I remain,
and contemplate my death.

580
01:09:33,432 --> 01:09:35,332
Moro! You must ask the Shishi-Gami...

581
01:09:35,401 --> 01:09:38,666
San, I have already lived long enough.

582
01:09:38,738 --> 01:09:42,003
The Shishi-Gami will probably
take my life, rather than heal me.

583
01:09:42,508 --> 01:09:45,238
No! Mother, you're here
to protect the Shishi-Gami!

584
01:09:45,811 --> 01:09:50,839
We are not fooled! Nago was beautiful
and strong. Our brother would not run!

585
01:09:51,484 --> 01:09:54,078
You wolves must have eaten him!

586
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:57,453
Silence! My mother shall not be slandered
by the likes of you!

587
01:09:57,790 --> 01:10:00,588
Wild gods of the mountains, please hear me.

588
01:10:01,527 --> 01:10:04,360
It was I who killed Nago.

589
01:10:05,082 --> 01:10:08,984
A tatari-gami attacked my village,
and to save my people, I felled it.

590
01:10:09,487 --> 01:10:13,082
It was a large boar-god.
And here is my proof...

591
01:10:18,896 --> 01:10:23,094
I came to this land to ask
the Shishi-Gami to lift my curse.

592
01:10:24,001 --> 01:10:27,596
He healed my injuries,
but did not remove the mark.

593
01:10:29,273 --> 01:10:33,607
He told me to live on in pain,
until the curse destroys me.

594
01:10:38,115 --> 01:10:41,983
Okkoto! At last, someone with some sense!

595
01:10:46,791 --> 01:10:47,815
Okkoto, wait!

596
01:10:48,392 --> 01:10:50,053
You mustn't eat him!

597
01:10:52,129 --> 01:10:56,463
You are Moro's daughter.
I have heard of you.

598
01:10:58,035 --> 01:10:59,468
Your eyes...

599
01:11:00,071 --> 01:11:02,972
Stand back. I will not eat him.

600
01:11:03,341 --> 01:11:04,467
Wolf Princess...

601
01:11:05,343 --> 01:11:09,177
Do not fear. I must pass along
the final moments of Nago's life.

602
01:11:22,426 --> 01:11:25,987
My thanks to you, young one.

603
01:11:26,063 --> 01:11:32,400
It is a sad thing for a tatari-gami
to have come from one of our tribe.

604
01:11:34,071 --> 01:11:37,802
Lord Okkoto...do you know
how I may lift my curse?

605
01:11:39,110 --> 01:11:44,548
Leave this forest. When next we meet,
I will have to kill you.

606
01:11:45,048 --> 01:11:49,542
You cannot win against
the guns of the humans.

607
01:11:49,654 --> 01:11:55,217
Moro, look on my tribe.
We grow small, and we grow stupid.

608
01:11:55,292 --> 01:11:57,590
To go on in this manner...

609
01:11:57,662 --> 01:12:01,291
...is to end as nothing more
than meat for the humans to hunt.

610
01:12:01,399 --> 01:12:06,234
To risk all on a final battle
is to play into human hands.

611
01:12:06,871 --> 01:12:10,238
I do not ask for the help of wolves.

612
01:12:10,675 --> 01:12:17,171
Even if we all perish in the fight,
we boars will have our vengence.

613
01:12:42,606 --> 01:12:44,096
The Shishi-Gami!

614
01:13:00,190 --> 01:13:02,681
Keep the oxen together!

615
01:13:06,096 --> 01:13:07,927
Hold your fire...let them come!

616
01:13:09,132 --> 01:13:10,292
Fire!

617
01:13:16,339 --> 01:13:17,738
Reload! Quick!

618
01:13:32,823 --> 01:13:36,520
That damned Eboshi's fighting
the wrong enemy!

619
01:13:36,601 --> 01:13:39,263
You men go on ahead, and keep hidden.

620
01:14:00,617 --> 01:14:02,847
I see them!
They're coming back!

621
01:14:08,492 --> 01:14:09,411
Chief...

622
01:14:09,466 --> 01:14:11,359
Oh, good, you are here.

623
01:14:12,062 --> 01:14:15,225
Let them know, we'll be moving soon.

624
01:14:19,803 --> 01:14:21,395
Hello, Jiko.

625
01:14:21,471 --> 01:14:26,101
The Emporer wishes us to act. Now is not
the time to spar with the local samurai.

626
01:14:26,777 --> 01:14:30,269
Lord Asano sets them against me.

627
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:33,513
Asano, eh? A powerful man.

628
01:14:33,583 --> 01:14:35,949
He demanded half our iron.

629
01:14:36,019 --> 01:14:37,748
Greedy, isn't he.

630
01:14:38,588 --> 01:14:41,455
But now is no time to fight men.

631
01:14:41,525 --> 01:14:44,392
The boars gather in the forest.
They'll be coming here soon.

632
01:14:45,328 --> 01:14:47,558
I suggest you give Asano what he wants.

633
01:14:47,631 --> 01:14:51,397
And after the Emporer's wishes are met,
you can fight whomever you like.

634
01:14:51,501 --> 01:14:55,028
Laby Eboshi! Hurry!
More samurai are coming!

635
01:15:00,377 --> 01:15:03,369
Speak of the devil! Asano's messengers...

636
01:15:03,446 --> 01:15:06,279
Messengers!
Remember your manners, ladies!

637
01:15:09,186 --> 01:15:10,847
Welcome back!

638
01:15:13,657 --> 01:15:15,750
Hey, don't you want to hear them out?

639
01:15:19,196 --> 01:15:24,395
Eboshi of Tatara Ba, your battle
with the local samurai was magnificent!

640
01:15:25,602 --> 01:15:30,369
We bring a message from the Chief Warlord.
Respectfully open your gates!

641
01:15:30,473 --> 01:15:33,442
We can hear you just fine where you are!

642
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:36,377
Lady Eboshi slaved to free this land
from the Mononoke.

643
01:15:36,446 --> 01:15:38,676
And now that it's worth something,
you show up!

644
01:15:38,782 --> 01:15:40,249
Leave here immediately!

645
01:15:40,317 --> 01:15:42,945
Insolent women!
Show some respect!

646
01:15:43,086 --> 01:15:44,610
Insolent women!?

647
01:15:44,688 --> 01:15:49,591
We haven't had any respect
since the day we were born!

648
01:15:49,659 --> 01:15:52,150
You want iron?  Here you go!

649
01:16:00,070 --> 01:16:03,096
They're really something!

650
01:16:03,173 --> 01:16:05,869
Samurai or forest god,
they don't care.

651
01:16:06,577 --> 01:16:09,978
Eboshi's women don't lack courage.

652
01:16:11,882 --> 01:16:13,747
What good is this paper?

653
01:16:14,384 --> 01:16:17,683
Well, it's been impressive enough
to get me the resources I need...

654
01:16:17,755 --> 01:16:20,690
...after all, we are going to kill a god!

655
01:16:22,092 --> 01:16:23,923
Yes, Lady Eboshi?

656
01:16:24,109 --> 01:16:26,608
Does this paper mean anything to you?

657
01:16:27,292 --> 01:16:28,865
It is from the Imperial Court.

658
01:16:28,932 --> 01:16:31,230
- The Imperial Court?
- What's that?

659
01:16:31,692 --> 01:16:33,767
- And signed by the Emporer.
- The Emporer...?

660
01:16:33,971 --> 01:16:37,065
OK, you got me there.

661
01:16:37,508 --> 01:16:38,941
You may go.

662
01:16:40,644 --> 01:16:45,081
Each day that we cut trees and make
our steel, the forest grows weaker.

663
01:16:45,149 --> 01:16:47,208
My way, there are fewer casualties.

664
01:16:48,052 --> 01:16:50,543
We gave you plenty of money and steel.

665
01:16:50,621 --> 01:16:54,580
And we didn't lend you guns and troops
just so you could make more of both.

666
01:16:54,658 --> 01:16:57,650
Of course, I'm sure you know that.

667
01:16:57,761 --> 01:17:00,267
Could it be someone has
led the Emporer to think...

668
01:17:00,293 --> 01:17:02,746
...that the Shishi-Gami's head
will bestow immortality?

669
01:17:02,833 --> 01:17:07,023
I'm sure I don't know what
the Emporer thinks.

670
01:17:07,078 --> 01:17:08,499
I'm just a simple monk, afterall.

671
01:17:09,807 --> 01:17:11,331
I will keep my promises.

672
01:17:11,408 --> 01:17:15,777
The boars will be easier
than Moro and her tribe.

673
01:17:16,780 --> 01:17:20,511
And bring out those suspicious troops
you've got 'hidden' down in the ravine.

674
01:17:21,185 --> 01:17:25,383
So I'm found out, am l?

675
01:17:25,456 --> 01:17:27,788
Oh, and one more thing...

676
01:17:28,192 --> 01:17:30,285
Did a young man pass through your land?

677
01:17:30,994 --> 01:17:33,792
Riding a strange red elk?

678
01:17:34,364 --> 01:17:35,695
He's already left.

679
01:17:55,285 --> 01:17:57,253
They make my skin crawl!

680
01:17:57,321 --> 01:18:01,155
They're not ordinary hunters.
They're Jibashiri.

681
01:18:01,959 --> 01:18:03,950
Let us go with you!

682
01:18:04,027 --> 01:18:05,654
We can't trust them!

683
01:18:06,330 --> 01:18:09,128
We can't help you from here
if anything happens!

684
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:10,894
And you've taught us to shoot!

685
01:18:11,568 --> 01:18:14,765
And that's why I need you here.

686
01:18:15,272 --> 01:18:18,139
I fear humans more than Mononoke.

687
01:18:19,343 --> 01:18:22,630
After the Shishi-Gami is dead,
you just watch.

688
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:27,039
It isn't just the Shishi-Gami's head
that those umbrella-toting monks want.

689
01:18:28,018 --> 01:18:31,613
And even the gunner troops they've
sent us may become our enemies.

690
01:18:32,689 --> 01:18:36,125
We can't trust men.
Stay on your toes.

691
01:18:36,727 --> 01:18:40,891
Don't worry about Lady Eboshi.
I'll protect her with my life.

692
01:18:40,964 --> 01:18:43,330
- If only that were true!
- What?!

693
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,800
Maybe if you were a woman...

694
01:19:55,839 --> 01:19:57,170
Do you suffer?

695
01:19:59,375 --> 01:20:03,072
You could end it all
by jumping, you know.

696
01:20:03,146 --> 01:20:06,377
Even as your strength returns,
the mark will continue to spread.

697
01:20:07,584 --> 01:20:10,018
I feel like I've slept for days.

698
01:20:10,754 --> 01:20:13,382
I dreamt that San was watching over me.

699
01:20:13,490 --> 01:20:20,419
I hoped you would cry out in your sleep,
so I could bite off your head.

700
01:20:20,497 --> 01:20:22,488
What a beautiful forest...

701
01:20:22,566 --> 01:20:24,397
Are the boars moving yet?

702
01:20:25,002 --> 01:20:28,938
Go back into the cave, boy.
You can't hear it...

703
01:20:29,006 --> 01:20:31,907
The cry of the woods
trampled under by boars...

704
01:20:33,010 --> 01:20:37,913
I sit here listening to it,
and to the crumbling of my body...

705
01:20:37,981 --> 01:20:40,381
...and wait for that woman...

706
01:20:40,450 --> 01:20:43,977
How I yearn to crush
her head in my jaws!

707
01:20:44,621 --> 01:20:48,079
Moro, is there no way for the forest
and the humans to live in peace?

708
01:20:48,492 --> 01:20:50,016
Must this end in fighting?!

709
01:20:50,127 --> 01:20:52,721
The humans spread farther
and farther.

710
01:20:52,796 --> 01:20:55,390
In time, they'll spread even to here.

711
01:20:55,498 --> 01:20:58,899
And what about San?
When you die, is she left alone?

712
01:20:59,002 --> 01:21:02,904
Typical human.  Irrational, selfish...

713
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:09,442
She is a daughter of the forest.
She shall live and die with the forest.

714
01:21:09,546 --> 01:21:12,140
Set her free! She's human!

715
01:21:12,816 --> 01:21:14,249
Silence, boy!

716
01:21:14,318 --> 01:21:17,310
You know nothing of what she is!

717
01:21:18,221 --> 01:21:24,160
Humans who violated our forest
threw her in my path to slow me down!

718
01:21:24,261 --> 01:21:27,628
She cannot be human,
nor can she become wolf.

719
01:21:27,698 --> 01:21:31,190
She is my dear, ugly,
furless child...

720
01:21:31,301 --> 01:21:33,792
How can you hope to save her?!

721
01:21:35,706 --> 01:21:38,539
I don't know.
But together we could survive.

722
01:21:40,844 --> 01:21:45,713
And how will you do that?
Side by side, fighting the humans?

723
01:21:46,483 --> 01:21:49,213
No. That would only spurn more
hatred and pain!

724
01:21:49,786 --> 01:21:54,246
There is nothing you can do, boy.

725
01:21:54,324 --> 01:21:57,521
Soon that mark will kill you.

726
01:21:57,594 --> 01:21:59,926
Leave here when the sun rises.

727
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:15,168
Were you able to walk?

728
01:22:17,981 --> 01:22:20,677
Only thanks to you and the Shishi-Gami.

729
01:23:21,878 --> 01:23:24,472
Yakkuru! Sorry for worrying you!

730
01:23:29,352 --> 01:23:31,582
My legs are so weak!

731
01:24:03,285 --> 01:24:05,913
It's too quiet...where are the kodama?

732
01:24:12,628 --> 01:24:15,358
We're close enough to
smell Tatara Ba's forge...

733
01:24:22,271 --> 01:24:26,105
Thank you for your help.
I have one favor to ask of you.

734
01:24:28,062 --> 01:24:30,201
Please give this to San.

735
01:24:38,787 --> 01:24:40,118
Let's go.

736
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:13,786
What a terrible smell!
It makes me sick!

737
01:25:13,855 --> 01:25:18,622
That's not normal smoke.
It's to confuse our sense of smell.

738
01:25:18,694 --> 01:25:19,683
That woman has arrived.

739
01:25:29,538 --> 01:25:31,028
...and she knows we're here!

740
01:25:31,106 --> 01:25:34,337
- Such an obvious trap.
- A trap?

741
01:25:34,843 --> 01:25:38,973
She's trying to lure the boars
into leaving the forest.

742
01:25:39,048 --> 01:25:40,845
She's has something big planned...

743
01:25:40,950 --> 01:25:44,886
Then we must warn them!
They'll all be killed!

744
01:25:45,688 --> 01:25:48,156
Okkoto is no fool.

745
01:25:48,223 --> 01:25:52,751
He will realize it is a trap,
but the boars will charge anyways.

746
01:25:52,828 --> 01:25:55,388
They are a proud race.

747
01:25:56,131 --> 01:26:00,124
The last one alive
will still be charging forward.

748
01:26:05,107 --> 01:26:06,631
They've begun cutting trees.

749
01:26:06,709 --> 01:26:08,540
More bait.

750
01:26:11,146 --> 01:26:13,706
Mother, I must go.

751
01:26:13,782 --> 01:26:16,478
I must help Okkoto.

752
01:26:16,552 --> 01:26:18,042
I can be his eyes.

753
01:26:18,988 --> 01:26:20,785
As you will.

754
01:26:20,856 --> 01:26:25,020
Although there is another path...
a life with that human boy...

755
01:26:25,361 --> 01:26:27,261
I hate humans!

756
01:26:39,208 --> 01:26:41,699
From Ashitaka? For me?

757
01:26:45,447 --> 01:26:46,471
It's beautiful...

758
01:26:47,249 --> 01:26:49,012
You two go with San.

759
01:26:49,118 --> 01:26:51,807
I will stay with the Shishi-Gami.

760
01:26:52,145 --> 01:26:52,985
Let's go.

761
01:27:14,009 --> 01:27:17,877
The tribe of Moro fights with you!
Where is Okkoto?

762
01:27:20,983 --> 01:27:22,280
Thank you.

763
01:28:47,902 --> 01:28:49,267
It's coming from Tatara Ba!

764
01:28:55,039 --> 01:28:56,199
Let's go!

765
01:29:00,114 --> 01:29:01,138
Who goes there?!

766
01:29:01,449 --> 01:29:02,438
Samurai!

767
01:29:04,519 --> 01:29:05,508
Halt!

768
01:29:06,587 --> 01:29:08,077
Let me pass!

769
01:29:24,705 --> 01:29:26,172
Who was that?!

770
01:29:30,178 --> 01:29:32,669
- He's stopping them!
- What!?

771
01:29:33,314 --> 01:29:35,043
Don't waste your arrows!

772
01:29:59,407 --> 01:30:00,533
Come quick!

773
01:30:00,608 --> 01:30:02,200
You're right! It is him!

774
01:30:02,276 --> 01:30:03,265
Is it a ghost!?

775
01:30:03,344 --> 01:30:05,642
Ashitaka!

776
01:30:05,713 --> 01:30:06,702
Toki?

777
01:30:07,215 --> 01:30:08,512
Is everyone all right?

778
01:30:08,583 --> 01:30:09,948
More or less...

779
01:30:10,050 --> 01:30:14,578
As soon as our men were out of sight,
the samurai moved in to attack!

780
01:30:14,654 --> 01:30:18,124
They've taken the lower ward!
But we're holding them off!

781
01:30:18,383 --> 01:30:19,215
Where's Lady Eboshi?

782
01:30:19,293 --> 01:30:23,923
She took every man who could move
and went to kill the Shishi-Gami!

783
01:30:23,998 --> 01:30:25,989
We've no way to call
her back for help!

784
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:29,501
Hunt the Shishi-Gami?!
So that sound before...

785
01:30:29,604 --> 01:30:32,232
Sir! I've still got your bow!

786
01:30:32,306 --> 01:30:34,866
What about his saddle and cloak?!

787
01:30:34,942 --> 01:30:36,466
- But...
- Useless!

788
01:30:37,111 --> 01:30:38,772
Koroku, thanks!

789
01:30:38,846 --> 01:30:41,508
I'll bring help. Can you hold out?

790
01:30:41,615 --> 01:30:45,073
If worse comes to worse, we can
always pour hot iron on them!

791
01:30:45,168 --> 01:30:46,692
Hurry, Ashitaka!

792
01:30:46,754 --> 01:30:48,779
Bring Lady Eboshi back quickly!

793
01:30:53,961 --> 01:30:55,155
Missed!

794
01:30:55,228 --> 01:30:57,219
They're bringing boats. Hurry!

795
01:30:57,298 --> 01:31:01,200
We entrust Lady Eboshi's safety to you!
And in the meantime, we will fight, too!

796
01:31:02,936 --> 01:31:04,836
I'll be back! Good luck!

797
01:31:07,675 --> 01:31:09,905
Be careful!

798
01:31:13,147 --> 01:31:14,512
There he is!  Signal ahead!

799
01:31:24,492 --> 01:31:26,426
They're after us, Yakkuru!

800
01:32:09,402 --> 01:32:11,393
Burning flesh...

801
01:32:17,478 --> 01:32:18,775
Yakkuru!

802
01:32:57,685 --> 01:32:58,777
Stay back!

803
01:33:11,581 --> 01:33:13,556
Yakkuru, show me your wound...

804
01:33:15,469 --> 01:33:18,063
I'm sorry, I need you to wait here.
I will return.

805
01:33:21,008 --> 01:33:22,498
I said wait!

806
01:33:33,487 --> 01:33:35,045
Just a little further...

807
01:34:19,467 --> 01:34:20,729
Who goes there?!

808
01:34:21,402 --> 01:34:24,838
This is a place for the dead.
You must leave immediately!

809
01:34:25,706 --> 01:34:28,854
I have an urgent message from
the people of Tatara Ba.

810
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:30,361
I must see Lady Eboshi.

811
01:34:30,845 --> 01:34:34,611
She's not here. You will
tell me, instead.

812
01:34:35,316 --> 01:34:37,477
I will speak only to her! Where is she?!

813
01:34:37,585 --> 01:34:41,316
Young sir...you're alive!?

814
01:34:41,922 --> 01:34:43,787
What a mess this has all become.

815
01:34:43,858 --> 01:34:45,723
There's still men buried.

816
01:34:45,793 --> 01:34:46,953
It was horrible...

817
01:34:47,628 --> 01:34:49,619
Tatara Ba is under siege by samurai.

818
01:34:50,364 --> 01:34:54,630
The women are holding the inner stockade.
There is still hope if you go now!

819
01:34:54,702 --> 01:34:56,033
The bastards!

820
01:34:56,102 --> 01:34:58,468
Asano waited untill we left!

821
01:34:59,006 --> 01:35:00,769
Is Lady Eboshi here?

822
01:35:00,839 --> 01:35:03,571
No, she's gone to kill the Shishi-Gami!

823
01:35:03,644 --> 01:35:05,475
We must call her back!
There's no time!

824
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:08,546
If you are done spouting
nonsense, then leave.

825
01:35:08,615 --> 01:35:09,604
Everyone back to work!

826
01:35:09,717 --> 01:35:11,412
Are you serious?

827
01:35:11,485 --> 01:35:13,214
Now wait a minute!

828
01:35:13,621 --> 01:35:15,890
Do you intend to leave
those at Tatara Ba to die?

829
01:35:16,690 --> 01:35:18,658
If we wait we'll be too late!

830
01:35:18,726 --> 01:35:20,387
Send a messenger to find Eboshi!

831
01:35:20,461 --> 01:35:23,589
The woods are huge.
How could we find Eboshi in time?

832
01:35:23,731 --> 01:35:26,598
Aren't you supposed to be
good trackers?  Help us!

833
01:35:27,234 --> 01:35:29,896
Lady Eboshi's being used.

834
01:35:30,604 --> 01:35:33,869
Tell me, when the boars came,
did you see any wolves among them?

835
01:35:33,941 --> 01:35:36,239
Or San, the Mononoke princess?

836
01:35:36,310 --> 01:35:39,837
I don't know...it was pitch black
when they came at us.

837
01:35:39,914 --> 01:35:41,848
She was there.

838
01:35:42,249 --> 01:35:45,184
I was in the front...

839
01:35:45,252 --> 01:35:46,344
What happened?

840
01:35:46,420 --> 01:35:50,550
I...I can't remember.
Everything just happened so fast!

841
01:35:50,624 --> 01:35:53,923
Jiko's monks put us out there
to lure the boars in.

842
01:35:53,994 --> 01:35:56,121
They must have laid explosives
under the ground...

843
01:35:56,196 --> 01:35:58,391
...everything just exploded around us!

844
01:36:51,952 --> 01:36:53,442
Where's San?!

845
01:36:57,124 --> 01:37:00,252
Be still! I want to help you.

846
01:37:03,831 --> 01:37:07,082
A wolf! There's a wolf
still alive over here!

847
01:37:07,442 --> 01:37:08,728
Sir! What are you doing?!

848
01:37:13,207 --> 01:37:14,196
Sir!

849
01:37:14,274 --> 01:37:16,469
Move!  Boy, what are you doing!?

850
01:37:17,544 --> 01:37:21,207
I need this wolf to guide me.
If you will not look for Eboshi, I will.

851
01:37:21,315 --> 01:37:24,216
So you're with them, are you?

852
01:37:24,718 --> 01:37:26,083
Move.

853
01:37:26,787 --> 01:37:30,450
What's more important, the head of
the Shishi-Gami, or Tatara Ba?

854
01:37:31,125 --> 01:37:32,319
Poison darts!

855
01:37:38,532 --> 01:37:39,760
Stop!

856
01:37:46,306 --> 01:37:48,399
Everyone together!

857
01:37:58,652 --> 01:38:00,142
He's free!

858
01:38:11,731 --> 01:38:14,859
Go through the swamp
and hide near the lake.

859
01:38:15,269 --> 01:38:17,931
The gunners are with them.
Be careful.

860
01:38:18,539 --> 01:38:21,667
Take this. My last arrow's broken.

861
01:38:23,811 --> 01:38:25,142
You go with them.

862
01:38:25,212 --> 01:38:26,907
Take care of Yakkuru for me!

863
01:38:30,617 --> 01:38:32,744
Find San! That's where Eboshi will be!

864
01:38:44,698 --> 01:38:48,099
Don't fall behind the Jibashiri.
Today we finish this!

865
01:38:50,971 --> 01:38:52,097
Jiko...

866
01:38:52,172 --> 01:38:54,140
Well? How does it look?

867
01:38:54,241 --> 01:38:59,144
Okkoto's hurt. He and the girl
are moving deeper into the forest.

868
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:03,187
They go to the Shishi-Gami
for help. Follow them!

869
01:39:03,810 --> 01:39:06,444
But the Shishi-Gami will not appear
if they suspect you are human!

870
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:08,613
Not a problem.

871
01:39:09,490 --> 01:39:12,482
Is that boar's blood on his face?

872
01:39:12,893 --> 01:39:15,623
That's the Jibashiri, for you.
Disgusting, isn't it?

873
01:39:23,704 --> 01:39:27,162
Keep going! We're almost to
the Shishi-Gami's waters.

874
01:39:44,625 --> 01:39:46,115
Something's coming!

875
01:39:48,896 --> 01:39:52,059
Okkoto, something's wrong!
We're so close.  Hang in there!

876
01:39:52,799 --> 01:39:54,664
Something unnatural is approaching.

877
01:39:54,735 --> 01:39:57,727
There's too much blood.
I can't smell what it is.

878
01:40:02,643 --> 01:40:03,701
The apes!

879
01:40:03,810 --> 01:40:05,505
You did this.

880
01:40:05,579 --> 01:40:07,945
It is your fault. Forest will die.

881
01:40:08,515 --> 01:40:12,451
Is this how you thank those
who fought for your forest?

882
01:40:12,553 --> 01:40:14,714
You've brought something unspeakable!

883
01:40:14,788 --> 01:40:17,450
Things neither animal nor human!

884
01:40:18,058 --> 01:40:20,549
Neither animal nor human?

885
01:40:26,667 --> 01:40:29,067
- They're here!
- It's the end!

886
01:40:48,522 --> 01:40:49,580
Warriors!

887
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:54,587
They've returned...

888
01:40:55,963 --> 01:41:01,833
They've returned!  My warriors have
returned from the land of the dead!

889
01:41:05,806 --> 01:41:10,971
Forward, my warriors!
To the Shishi-Gami's waters!

890
01:41:17,317 --> 01:41:21,219
Okkoto, no! The dead
cannot come back to life!

891
01:41:26,660 --> 01:41:29,151
They wear boar skins
to hide their scent!

892
01:41:29,263 --> 01:41:30,594
They're men!

893
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:37,066
Stop! You must not bring them
to the Shishi-Gami!

894
01:41:41,541 --> 01:41:43,509
Shishi-Gami! Show yourself!

895
01:41:43,577 --> 01:41:49,413
If you are lord of this forest, revive
my warriors and we shall slay the humans!

896
01:41:51,351 --> 01:41:53,410
Okkoto! You must calm yourself!

897
01:41:54,254 --> 01:41:57,417
We're surrounded!
Okkoto's done for! Leave him!

898
01:41:57,516 --> 01:42:00,417
No! He'll end up a tatari-gami!

899
01:42:01,194 --> 01:42:04,925
Go and warn Mother of
what the humans have done!

900
01:42:05,465 --> 01:42:07,899
We need her strength!

901
01:42:09,703 --> 01:42:11,967
Hurry, the Moro tribe must not die!

902
01:42:13,407 --> 01:42:14,635
Go!

903
01:42:33,994 --> 01:42:35,734
I will kill the first
one that moves.

904
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:39,013
And your true form will be
exposed for all the forest to see!

905
01:42:49,976 --> 01:42:51,466
Ashitaka?

906
01:42:57,851 --> 01:42:58,840
Stay Back!

907
01:43:06,026 --> 01:43:10,292
I burn! A flame bursts from within me!

908
01:43:11,765 --> 01:43:13,145
No!

909
01:43:13,667 --> 01:43:16,568
Okkoto! You mustn't become a tatari-gami!

910
01:43:18,505 --> 01:43:20,029
Okkoto!

911
01:43:22,709 --> 01:43:23,733
An answer!

912
01:43:27,648 --> 01:43:28,672
What is it?

913
01:43:28,749 --> 01:43:30,410
- San's in danger!
- Let's go!

914
01:43:58,946 --> 01:44:00,379
It burns!

915
01:44:09,356 --> 01:44:10,482
No!

916
01:44:10,557 --> 01:44:13,651
I don't want to become a tatari-gami!
Please, Okkoto!

917
01:44:25,305 --> 01:44:26,670
Too slow! Get on!

918
01:44:41,088 --> 01:44:42,680
A wolf!

919
01:44:45,292 --> 01:44:46,281
Eboshi!

920
01:44:53,233 --> 01:44:54,894
Dammit! You go on ahead!

921
01:44:56,269 --> 01:44:58,362
Eboshi, listen!

922
01:44:58,472 --> 01:44:59,837
Stop!

923
01:44:59,906 --> 01:45:00,895
Ashitaka?

924
01:45:01,742 --> 01:45:06,406
The samurai are attacking Tatara Ba!
Stop this futile hunt and return at once!

925
01:45:06,947 --> 01:45:08,175
The women are fighting!

926
01:45:09,149 --> 01:45:12,949
The men are heading back now!
Your people need you!

927
01:45:13,553 --> 01:45:15,885
What proof do you have?

928
01:45:15,956 --> 01:45:19,448
None! I would have stayed
and fought if I could!

929
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:23,587
So it's 'don't kill the Shishi-Gami,
kill the samurai,' is it?

930
01:45:24,131 --> 01:45:28,227
Why can't the forest and the
people of Tatara Ba live together?

931
01:45:30,637 --> 01:45:32,468
Which side is he on?

932
01:45:32,539 --> 01:45:33,665
Let's go back!

933
01:45:34,474 --> 01:45:39,673
I've done all I can for the women.
They can defend themselves.

934
01:45:41,956 --> 01:45:44,754
We've reached water.
The Shishi-Gami won't be far.

935
01:45:46,086 --> 01:45:48,316
The moment of truth!
Don't let down your guard!

936
01:45:49,389 --> 01:45:51,016
Why don't we get rid of her now?

937
01:45:51,091 --> 01:45:54,618
Killing gods is scary business.
Let her do it.

938
01:46:21,455 --> 01:46:23,252
Moro! Are you alive?

939
01:46:23,323 --> 01:46:24,688
San!

940
01:46:24,758 --> 01:46:26,089
San, where are you?

941
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:28,291
San!

942
01:46:35,969 --> 01:46:37,027
Ashitaka!

943
01:46:44,644 --> 01:46:45,633
Okkoto...

944
01:46:53,954 --> 01:46:54,943
Leave, boy.

945
01:46:56,256 --> 01:46:58,781
If we fight, the Shishi-Gami
will not appear.

946
01:47:03,430 --> 01:47:06,297
Okkoto! Be still!

947
01:47:10,437 --> 01:47:14,237
Okkoto! Return San to me.
Where is she?

948
01:47:15,075 --> 01:47:18,101
San, can you hear me?
It's me, Ashitaka!

949
01:47:24,417 --> 01:47:25,679
San!

950
01:47:32,659 --> 01:47:34,320
Shut him up!

951
01:47:38,999 --> 01:47:40,899
Kill him! Kill him!

952
01:48:05,125 --> 01:48:06,353
San!

953
01:48:08,995 --> 01:48:10,326
San!

954
01:48:13,166 --> 01:48:14,656
Ashitaka!

955
01:48:18,738 --> 01:48:20,035
San!

956
01:48:20,140 --> 01:48:21,198
Ashitaka!

957
01:48:29,015 --> 01:48:35,352
And here I thought I was saving my
last bit of strength for Eboshi...

958
01:48:35,455 --> 01:48:37,480
Close ranks!

959
01:48:55,074 --> 01:48:57,599
Do not let him touch you.

960
01:48:57,677 --> 01:48:59,440
It's curse is not for you to carry.

961
01:49:08,989 --> 01:49:10,684
Have you lost your power of speech?

962
01:49:11,892 --> 01:49:16,386
Well done. Fall back
and tend to the wounded.

963
01:49:17,797 --> 01:49:20,322
My, my, what a horrible sight!

964
01:49:28,708 --> 01:49:29,697
There he is!

965
01:49:42,455 --> 01:49:44,543
Give me back my daughter!

966
01:50:06,913 --> 01:50:08,437
Ashitaka...

967
01:50:08,515 --> 01:50:10,915
Will you save San?

968
01:50:20,427 --> 01:50:22,156
The Shishi-Gami...

969
01:50:33,006 --> 01:50:34,337
Eboshi! Don't shoot!

970
01:50:48,288 --> 01:50:52,486
Eboshi! The Shishi-Gami
is not your enemy!

971
01:50:53,026 --> 01:50:54,323
Your gun was ineffective.

972
01:50:54,394 --> 01:50:55,759
That was only my first try.

973
01:51:05,605 --> 01:51:06,594
San!

974
01:51:16,782 --> 01:51:18,113
Don't die!

975
01:51:45,444 --> 01:51:48,174
What?! Why did
the Shishi-Gami kill them?

976
01:52:08,474 --> 01:52:10,499
He's transitioning to the Daidarabotchi!

977
01:52:10,568 --> 01:52:12,092
Everyone! Watch closely.

978
01:52:12,772 --> 01:52:14,831
I will show you how you kill a god.

979
01:52:14,941 --> 01:52:17,535
The Shishi-Gami may be
a god of life and death...

980
01:52:18,077 --> 01:52:20,238
...but that is no excuse to cower in fear!

981
01:52:36,662 --> 01:52:38,323
Stop!

982
01:52:41,367 --> 01:52:42,356
Eboshi!

983
01:52:54,580 --> 01:52:57,242
Goddammit, you demon!

984
01:53:07,259 --> 01:53:09,557
Got him! Go grab the head!

985
01:53:48,801 --> 01:53:51,565
Jiko! Bring the box!

986
01:53:52,171 --> 01:53:55,163
The porters are all dead!
Quickly, quickly!

987
01:53:56,776 --> 01:54:00,337
Do not touch the Shishi-Gami's body.
It will steal your life away!

988
01:54:04,383 --> 01:54:06,578
As promised, one head!

989
01:54:15,227 --> 01:54:16,854
Lady Eboshi!

990
01:54:16,929 --> 01:54:19,329
Moro, you bitch!  Just a head,
and still a wolf can bite!

991
01:54:19,865 --> 01:54:23,528
Come on, come on!
Hurry, hurry!

992
01:54:23,602 --> 01:54:24,591
Jiko!

993
01:54:27,873 --> 01:54:29,636
Run!

994
01:54:46,358 --> 01:54:47,518
To the island!

995
01:54:47,625 --> 01:54:49,024
But I can't swim!

996
01:54:49,095 --> 01:54:50,756
Then walk along the bottom!

997
01:55:18,958 --> 01:55:21,188
Give her to me! I'll rip her apart!

998
01:55:21,260 --> 01:55:24,388
Moro's already taken her revenge.
Eboshi is punished.

999
01:55:24,930 --> 01:55:25,988
Lady Eboshi!

1000
01:55:26,065 --> 01:55:27,293
Give me a hand!

1001
01:55:30,769 --> 01:55:33,237
I don't need your help.

1002
01:55:33,772 --> 01:55:36,741
I promised Toki and the others
that I would bring you back.

1003
01:55:42,615 --> 01:55:45,413
He's looking for his head.
We can't stay here.

1004
01:55:45,484 --> 01:55:46,473
San!

1005
01:55:47,052 --> 01:55:48,144
I need your help.

1006
01:55:48,220 --> 01:55:50,882
No! You're on the side of the humans!

1007
01:55:50,956 --> 01:55:52,856
Take that woman and leave!

1008
01:55:56,028 --> 01:55:58,053
You humans did this,
and I hate you all!

1009
01:55:59,265 --> 01:56:00,772
I am human.

1010
01:56:00,835 --> 01:56:02,589
...and so are you.

1011
01:56:02,668 --> 01:56:05,603
Silence! I am wolf!

1012
01:56:06,485 --> 01:56:08,462
- San...
- Stay away from me!

1013
01:56:14,246 --> 01:56:17,443
I'm sorry. I tried to stop this.

1014
01:56:24,623 --> 01:56:28,684
It's over. Everything.
The forest is dead.

1015
01:56:38,003 --> 01:56:42,463
Nothing is over.  We're still alive.
Please, San, help me.

1016
01:57:08,434 --> 01:57:10,299
Wait! Help us!

1017
01:57:10,402 --> 01:57:13,166
A little crisis and they're useless!

1018
01:57:16,508 --> 01:57:18,271
No, no, no!

1019
01:57:23,882 --> 01:57:25,577
The head's moving!

1020
01:57:28,687 --> 01:57:30,450
It's calling him here!

1021
01:58:13,866 --> 01:58:14,992
It's fixed.

1022
01:58:15,067 --> 01:58:16,329
Thanks.

1023
01:58:16,669 --> 01:58:18,227
It's very quiet...

1024
01:58:18,304 --> 01:58:19,931
They're waiting for dawn.

1025
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:24,339
I wonder if that young man
found Lady Eboshi...

1026
01:58:24,410 --> 01:58:29,404
Of course he did! They'll be
marching over that hill any minute now.

1027
01:58:31,684 --> 01:58:34,075
Oh, look at that scruffy face.

1028
01:58:34,101 --> 01:58:35,736
Hey! Koroku!

1029
01:58:35,787 --> 01:58:38,779
Oh, let him sleep while he can.

1030
01:58:48,834 --> 01:58:51,394
I don't like the sound of that...

1031
01:59:03,982 --> 01:59:05,210
The Daidarabotchi!

1032
01:59:19,064 --> 01:59:21,362
Don't leave your posts!

1033
01:59:21,900 --> 01:59:23,868
What do we do?!
It's coming this way!

1034
01:59:23,936 --> 01:59:24,925
It's no good! We run!

1035
01:59:25,637 --> 01:59:29,334
We guard Tatara Ba!
That's what we promised Lady Eboshi!

1036
01:59:35,414 --> 01:59:37,541
Down there! It's Ashitaka!

1037
01:59:42,888 --> 01:59:43,877
Everyone run!

1038
01:59:44,690 --> 01:59:47,523
The Shishi-Gami is searching
for its stolen head!

1039
01:59:48,160 --> 01:59:50,287
Touch that black muck, and you will die!

1040
01:59:50,963 --> 01:59:53,557
Head into the lake!
The water will slow it down!

1041
01:59:54,399 --> 01:59:57,960
Eboshi and the men are on
the other side, heading this way!

1042
01:59:58,036 --> 02:00:00,267
We'll try to return the Shishi-Gami's head!

1043
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:02,162
- Ashitaka...
- Please hurry!

1044
02:00:02,674 --> 02:00:04,539
It's coming this way!

1045
02:00:04,610 --> 02:00:06,100
What should we do, Toki?

1046
02:00:06,178 --> 02:00:07,236
Don't Panic!

1047
02:00:07,746 --> 02:00:09,236
Everyone into the water.

1048
02:00:09,448 --> 02:00:11,848
Stay calm! And help the injured!

1049
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:23,557
No, not that way!

1050
02:00:39,945 --> 02:00:41,708
Oh no...the roof...

1051
02:00:47,419 --> 02:00:51,048
It's no use. Tatara Ba is lost.
This is the end!

1052
02:00:51,857 --> 02:00:55,349
As long as we're alive, we have hope!
To deeper water!  Quickly!

1053
02:01:13,512 --> 02:01:15,173
There they are!

1054
02:01:27,292 --> 02:01:28,350
Go!

1055
02:01:29,328 --> 02:01:30,693
Stop!

1056
02:01:32,331 --> 02:01:34,458
Oh, you're alive! Thank goodness!

1057
02:01:35,148 --> 02:01:37,997
We must return the head.
Put it down and back away.

1058
02:01:38,103 --> 02:01:41,172
Fool! We're so close!
The sun is about to rise!

1059
02:01:41,243 --> 02:01:43,684
It's bloated and slow...look...

1060
02:01:43,710 --> 02:01:48,469
...and when the sun's rays touch it,
it will vanish like a bad dream!

1061
02:01:49,014 --> 02:01:50,879
Jiko, it's coming! Hurry!

1062
02:01:50,990 --> 02:01:55,859
Look, everyone wants everything, that's
human nature...but I'm about to get it!

1063
02:01:56,388 --> 02:01:57,719
I don't want to kill you...

1064
02:01:58,557 --> 02:02:00,218
Of course...

1065
02:02:00,325 --> 02:02:02,953
Don't look so stern...

1066
02:02:09,634 --> 02:02:10,999
Run!

1067
02:02:30,322 --> 02:02:31,311
Ashitaka!

1068
02:02:39,498 --> 02:02:40,556
Uh-oh...

1069
02:02:43,402 --> 02:02:44,926
We're surrounded!

1070
02:02:45,937 --> 02:02:47,598
Morning sun, rise!

1071
02:02:47,672 --> 02:02:48,730
Open it!

1072
02:02:48,807 --> 02:02:50,832
Don't you get it?  It's too late!

1073
02:02:51,476 --> 02:02:54,070
Ashitaka, don't bother talking to humans...

1074
02:02:54,146 --> 02:02:56,137
I wish to return it with human hands.

1075
02:02:57,049 --> 02:02:59,882
Dammit, I don't think this is a good idea.

1076
02:03:14,699 --> 02:03:16,030
Noble Shishi-Gami!

1077
02:03:16,168 --> 02:03:18,033
We return your head!

1078
02:03:18,837 --> 02:03:20,828
Take it in peace!

1079
02:03:31,583 --> 02:03:33,551
Here he comes!

1080
02:04:04,748 --> 02:04:06,045
It's stopped...

1081
02:04:06,118 --> 02:04:07,278
The men!

1082
02:04:20,365 --> 02:04:22,026
Lady Eboshi!

1083
02:04:22,100 --> 02:04:23,761
Mind her wounds!

1084
02:04:52,931 --> 02:04:54,330
It's falling!

1085
02:05:00,539 --> 02:05:02,302
Hang on! Don't let go!

1086
02:06:09,374 --> 02:06:12,935
Amazing.  The Shishi-Gami brings
life, even in the face of death.

1087
02:06:44,309 --> 02:06:46,209
San, look!

1088
02:07:16,741 --> 02:07:19,733
Even if it all grows back, this is
no longer the Shishi-Gami's forest.

1089
02:07:20,645 --> 02:07:22,340
The Shishi-Gami is dead.

1090
02:07:23,080 --> 02:07:26,607
The Shishi-Gami can't die.
He is life itself.

1091
02:07:26,684 --> 02:07:29,084
Life and death, he lives on in both.

1092
02:07:29,821 --> 02:07:31,379
And he's told me to live.

1093
02:07:40,031 --> 02:07:44,092
Ashitaka, you mean a lot to me.
But I haven't forgiven humans.

1094
02:07:44,168 --> 02:07:47,865
That's all right. You return to the forest.
And I will help rebuild Tatara Ba.

1095
02:07:48,706 --> 02:07:49,866
I'll always be near.

1096
02:07:50,675 --> 02:07:53,166
Yakkuru and I will visit you.
As often as we can.

1097
02:08:05,022 --> 02:08:09,686
Can you believe it?
Saved by wolves!

1098
02:08:10,328 --> 02:08:14,230
Someone bring Ashitaka.
I want to thank him.

1099
02:08:14,298 --> 02:08:18,325
We'll start over again.
We'll build a good village.

1100
02:08:19,036 --> 02:08:22,597
Well, I give up!
You can't win against fools...

1101
02:13:26,779 --> 02:13:32,789
The End
