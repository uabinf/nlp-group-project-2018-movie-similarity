1
00:00:14,613 --> 00:00:18,379
<i>"I'll miss you, Chihiro.
Your best friend, Rumi."</i>

2
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,442
<i>Chihiro.
Chihiro, we're almost there.</i>

3
00:00:23,488 --> 00:00:26,184
<i>This really is in
the middle of nowhere.</i>

4
00:00:26,258 --> 00:00:28,988
<i>I'm gonna have to
go to the next town to shop.</i>

5
00:00:29,061 --> 00:00:31,291
<i>We'll just have to learn to like it.</i>

6
00:00:33,498 --> 00:00:37,332
Look, Chihiro, there's your new school.
Looks great, doesn't it?

7
00:00:37,402 --> 00:00:40,530
<i>It doesn't look so bad.</i>

8
00:00:47,613 --> 00:00:51,913
It's gonna stink.
I liked my old school.

9
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,354
Mom! My flowers are dying.

10
00:00:57,422 --> 00:01:00,084
I told you not to
smother them like that.

11
00:01:00,158 --> 00:01:04,219
We'll put them in water
when we get to our new home.

12
00:01:04,296 --> 00:01:07,993
I finally get a bouquet, and it's
a good-bye present. That's depressing.

13
00:01:08,066 --> 00:01:11,433
Daddy bought you a rose for
your birthday. Don't you remember?

14
00:01:11,503 --> 00:01:14,495
Yeah, one.
Just one rose isn't a bouquet.

15
00:01:14,573 --> 00:01:17,337
Hold on to your card.
I'm opening the window.

16
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:21,038
<i>And quit whining.
It's fun to move to a new place.</i>

17
00:01:21,113 --> 00:01:23,104
<i>It's an adventure.</i>

18
00:01:57,515 --> 00:02:00,313
Wait. Did I take the wrong turn?

19
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,710
This can't be right.

20
00:02:03,788 --> 00:02:06,222
- Look, there's our house.
- Huh?

21
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,724
<i>It's that blue one on the end.</i>

22
00:02:08,793 --> 00:02:12,559
Oh, you're right.
I must have missed the turnoff.

23
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,064
<i>This road should get us there.</i>

24
00:02:15,132 --> 00:02:17,464
<i>Don't take a shortcut.
You always get us lost.</i>

25
00:02:17,535 --> 00:02:20,504
<i>- Trust me. It's gonna work.
- What are those stones?</i>

26
00:02:20,571 --> 00:02:23,506
- They look like little houses.
- They're shrines.

27
00:02:23,574 --> 00:02:26,543
Some people think
little spirits live there.

28
00:02:31,015 --> 00:02:35,475
- Dad, I think we're lost.
- We're fine. I've got four-wheel drive.

29
00:02:35,553 --> 00:02:37,646
Sit down, please, sweetie.

30
00:02:54,872 --> 00:02:56,703
<i>Honey! Honey!</i>

31
00:02:56,774 --> 00:03:00,141
Slow down! You're gonna kill us.

32
00:03:01,779 --> 00:03:04,270
What's that?

33
00:03:17,662 --> 00:03:21,860
- What's this old building?
- It looks like an entrance.

34
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:25,562
Honey, get back in the car.
We're going to be late.

35
00:03:25,636 --> 00:03:27,695
Chihiro.

36
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:29,706
Oh, for heaven's sake.

37
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:32,470
This building's not old. It's fake.

38
00:03:32,543 --> 00:03:34,807
These stones are
just made of plaster.

39
00:03:44,255 --> 00:03:46,189
The wind's pulling us in.

40
00:03:46,257 --> 00:03:50,193
- What is it?
- Let's go in. I want to see what's on the other side.

41
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:52,923
I'm not going.
It gives me the creeps.

42
00:03:52,997 --> 00:03:55,693
Don't be such
a scaredy-cat, Chihiro.

43
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:59,702
- Let's just take a look.
- The movers will get to our house before we do.

44
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,501
It's all right. They've got the keys.
They can start without us.

45
00:04:03,574 --> 00:04:07,135
- All right. Just a quick look.
- Forget it. I'm not going.

46
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,811
Come on, you guys.
Let's get out of here.

47
00:04:10,881 --> 00:04:12,815
Come on, honey. It'll be fun.

48
00:04:12,883 --> 00:04:15,317
I'm not going!

49
00:04:22,693 --> 00:04:25,594
Chihiro, just wait in the car then.

50
00:04:25,663 --> 00:04:28,723
But, Mom!

51
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:32,496
Wait for me!

52
00:04:37,608 --> 00:04:40,008
Everybody, watch your step.

53
00:04:40,077 --> 00:04:43,137
Chihiro, don't cling like that.
You'll make me trip.

54
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:16,469
What is this place?

55
00:05:16,547 --> 00:05:20,381
Oh, do you hear that?

56
00:05:26,991 --> 00:05:30,483
- It sounds like a train.
- We must be near a train station.

57
00:05:30,561 --> 00:05:32,859
Come on. Let's go check it out.

58
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:12,625
- What are those weird buildings?
<i>- I knew it.</i>

59
00:06:12,703 --> 00:06:16,434
It's an abandoned theme park. See?

60
00:06:16,507 --> 00:06:20,102
<i>They built them
everywhere in the early '90s.</i>

61
00:06:20,177 --> 00:06:24,079
<i>Then the economy went bad,
and they all went bankrupt.</i>

62
00:06:24,148 --> 00:06:26,048
This must be one of them.

63
00:06:26,117 --> 00:06:29,109
Where are you going?
You said just a quick look.

64
00:06:29,186 --> 00:06:31,814
Now let's go back.

65
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,153
Hey!

66
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:47,637
Did you hear that building?
It was moaning.

67
00:06:47,705 --> 00:06:49,639
It's just the wind.

68
00:06:49,707 --> 00:06:51,607
Oh, what a beautiful place.

69
00:06:51,675 --> 00:06:54,610
We should have brought our lunch.
We could have had a picnic.

70
00:06:56,981 --> 00:06:59,643
Look. They were planning
to put a river here.

71
00:07:00,718 --> 00:07:03,585
Hmm?

72
00:07:03,654 --> 00:07:07,522
Hey, you smell that?

73
00:07:07,591 --> 00:07:10,458
- Something smells delicious.
- Yeah, and I'm starving.

74
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:13,395
Maybe this theme park's
still in business. Let's go.

75
00:07:13,464 --> 00:07:15,398
Chihiro, hurry it up.

76
00:07:15,466 --> 00:07:17,457
Wait a minute.

77
00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:35,944
Hmm.

78
00:07:39,123 --> 00:07:41,114
Over there.

79
00:07:50,434 --> 00:07:52,425
This way.

80
00:07:56,874 --> 00:07:59,672
How strange.
They're all restaurants.

81
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,007
Where is everybody?

82
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,149
Ah, there it is.

83
00:08:10,221 --> 00:08:13,190
Hey, I found it!

84
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,260
Hey, you gotta see this. In here.

85
00:08:27,638 --> 00:08:29,663
Ahh, look at this.

86
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,039
Hello in there!
Does anybody work here?

87
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,874
- Come in, Chihiro. It looks delicious.
- Mm-mmm.

88
00:08:35,946 --> 00:08:37,937
Anybody?

89
00:08:41,552 --> 00:08:44,988
Don't worry, honey. We can pay the bill
when they get back.

90
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,455
Good plan. Hey, that looks great.

91
00:08:47,524 --> 00:08:51,460
I wonder what this is called.

92
00:08:51,528 --> 00:08:54,691
Oh, it's delicious. Chihiro,
you have to taste this.

93
00:08:54,765 --> 00:08:59,327
I don't want any. We're gonna get
in trouble. Let's just get out of here.

94
00:08:59,403 --> 00:09:02,372
Don't worry.
You've got Daddy here.

95
00:09:02,439 --> 00:09:05,101
He's got credit cards and cash.

96
00:09:05,175 --> 00:09:07,166
Mmm.

97
00:09:09,046 --> 00:09:13,380
- Chihiro, you have to try this. It's so tender.
- Mm-mmm.

98
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,441
- Mustard?
- Thank you.

99
00:09:17,288 --> 00:09:20,280
<i>Mmm.</i>

100
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:29,730
Come on, you guys. You can't.

101
00:10:37,801 --> 00:10:39,701
That's weird.

102
00:10:49,913 --> 00:10:52,313
<i>It's a bathhouse.</i>

103
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:12,195
There's the train.

104
00:11:20,411 --> 00:11:23,744
You shouldn't be here. Get out of here now!

105
00:11:23,814 --> 00:11:25,748
- What?
- It's almost night.

106
00:11:25,816 --> 00:11:27,750
Leave, before it gets dark.

107
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,614
They're lighting the lamps.
Get out of here.

108
00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:36,250
You've gotta get across the river. Go!
I'll distract them.

109
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:51,773
What's up with him?

110
00:11:59,349 --> 00:12:01,283
Mom! Dad!

111
00:12:01,351 --> 00:12:05,845
Come on! Quit eating.
Let's get out of here!

112
00:12:32,349 --> 00:12:36,683
Mom! Dad! Where are you?

113
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,227
Mommy!

114
00:13:08,785 --> 00:13:10,582
Water?

115
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:25,058
What?

116
00:13:25,135 --> 00:13:27,330
I'm dreaming!
I'm dreaming!

117
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:31,607
Come on. Wake up! Wake up!

118
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:35,439
Wake up.

119
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:43,543
It's just a dream.
It's just a dream. Go away.

120
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,612
Away. Disappear.

121
00:13:54,464 --> 00:13:58,457
I'm see-through!

122
00:13:58,535 --> 00:14:01,504
It's just a bad dream.

123
00:14:34,171 --> 00:14:36,605
Oh!

124
00:14:41,011 --> 00:14:44,503
<i>You're thriving. Ah, yes.</i>

125
00:14:44,581 --> 00:14:47,778
- Looking forward to a relaxing time.
- Quite a long journey.

126
00:14:47,851 --> 00:14:51,810
<i>I hope they have...</i>

127
00:14:54,691 --> 00:14:57,125
Don't be afraid.
I just want to help you.

128
00:14:57,194 --> 00:14:59,253
No! No! No!

129
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:01,422
Open your mouth and eat this.

130
00:15:01,498 --> 00:15:05,161
You have to eat some food from
this world, or else you'll disappear.

131
00:15:05,235 --> 00:15:06,930
No!

132
00:15:09,973 --> 00:15:12,669
Don't worry.
It won't turn you into a pig.

133
00:15:12,743 --> 00:15:16,179
Chew it and swallow.

134
00:15:25,155 --> 00:15:27,487
There you go. You're all better.

135
00:15:27,557 --> 00:15:29,548
See for yourself.

136
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,730
- I'm okay.
- You see?

137
00:15:39,803 --> 00:15:42,499
- Now, come with me.
- Where are my mom and dad?

138
00:15:42,572 --> 00:15:44,870
They... didn't really
turn into pigs, did they?

139
00:15:44,941 --> 00:15:47,603
You can't see them now,
but you will.

140
00:15:48,979 --> 00:15:51,846
Don't move.

141
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,298
That bird's looking for you.
You've gotta get out of here.

142
00:16:14,371 --> 00:16:16,999
My legs! I can't stand up.

143
00:16:17,074 --> 00:16:19,008
Help! What do I do?

144
00:16:19,076 --> 00:16:22,011
Calm down.
Take a deep breath.

145
00:16:24,081 --> 00:16:28,984
In the name of the wind
and water within thee, unbind her.

146
00:16:29,052 --> 00:16:31,748
Get up.

147
00:17:02,285 --> 00:17:04,981
<i>Welcome. Welcome.</i>

148
00:17:05,055 --> 00:17:08,786
<i>Always nice to see you.
Welcome back.</i>

149
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:11,760
<i>Welcome. Welcome.</i>

150
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:15,889
<i>You have to hold your breath
while we cross the bridge.</i>

151
00:17:15,966 --> 00:17:21,302
Even the tiniest breath will break the
spell, and then everyone will see you.

152
00:17:21,371 --> 00:17:24,067
<i>Wonderful to see you.</i>

153
00:17:24,141 --> 00:17:26,200
<i>- Nice to see you.
- Welcome back.</i>

154
00:17:26,276 --> 00:17:28,301
I'm scared.

155
00:17:28,378 --> 00:17:30,312
Now just stay calm.

156
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,281
Welcome. Welcome.
Always nice to see you.

157
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,818
Welcome back.
Welcome. Welcome.

158
00:17:35,886 --> 00:17:38,286
- I'm back from my mission.
- Ahh, welcome.

159
00:17:38,355 --> 00:17:40,289
Welcome back, Master Haku.

160
00:17:40,357 --> 00:17:43,224
Take a deep breath.

161
00:17:43,293 --> 00:17:45,352
Hold it.

162
00:18:01,144 --> 00:18:03,374
Welcome. Welcome.

163
00:18:03,447 --> 00:18:06,245
Welcome back.
Good to see you.

164
00:18:06,316 --> 00:18:08,307
Hang on. Almost there.

165
00:18:08,385 --> 00:18:10,819
Master Haku!

166
00:18:10,887 --> 00:18:13,219
Where have you been?

167
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:16,418
Wha... A human?

168
00:18:16,493 --> 00:18:18,552
Let's go!

169
00:18:27,838 --> 00:18:31,535
Huh? Huh? Huh?

170
00:18:35,111 --> 00:18:39,741
Master Haku!
Master Haku!

171
00:18:39,816 --> 00:18:42,614
<i>Hurry. Boy, boy, boy,
it stinks up the place.</i>

172
00:18:42,686 --> 00:18:45,484
- They know you're here.
- I'm sorry. I took a breath.

173
00:18:45,555 --> 00:18:47,580
No, Chihiro, you did very well.

174
00:18:47,657 --> 00:18:50,091
Listen carefully to
what I tell you to do.

175
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,094
You can't stay here.
They'll find you...

176
00:18:52,162 --> 00:18:54,153
and you'll never get
to rescue your parents.

177
00:18:54,231 --> 00:18:56,222
I'll create a diversion
while you escape.

178
00:18:56,299 --> 00:18:58,529
No! Don't leave me.
I don't wanna be alone.

179
00:18:58,602 --> 00:19:02,060
You don't have any choice if you want
to help your parents.

180
00:19:02,138 --> 00:19:04,129
This is what you have to do.

181
00:19:04,207 --> 00:19:08,405
They did turn into pigs.
I wasn't dreaming.

182
00:19:08,478 --> 00:19:10,469
Don't worry.

183
00:19:10,547 --> 00:19:14,415
<i>Now, when things quiet down,
go out through the back gate.</i>

184
00:19:14,484 --> 00:19:17,783
<i>Go all the way down the stairs
until you reach the boiler room...</i>

185
00:19:17,854 --> 00:19:20,118
<i>where they stoke the fires.</i>

186
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,250
<i>There you'll find Kamajii,
the boiler man.</i>

187
00:19:23,326 --> 00:19:25,590
Kamajii?

188
00:19:25,662 --> 00:19:28,324
Tell him you want to work here.

189
00:19:28,398 --> 00:19:30,889
Even if he refuses, you must insist.

190
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:34,869
If you don't get a job,
Yubaba will turn you into an animal.

191
00:19:34,938 --> 00:19:36,872
Yubaba. Huh?

192
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,340
You'll see. She's the witch who
rules the bathhouse.

193
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:42,606
Kamajii will try to turn you away
or trick you into leaving...

194
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:44,613
but just keep asking for work.

195
00:19:44,681 --> 00:19:48,048
It'll be hard work,
but you'll be able to stay here.

196
00:19:48,118 --> 00:19:50,609
- Then, even Yubaba can't harm you.
- Mm-hmm.

197
00:19:50,687 --> 00:19:53,622
- Master Haku?
- Master Haku, where are you?

198
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:57,387
I have to go. Don't forget, Chihiro,
I'm your friend.

199
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,360
How did you know
my name's Chihiro?

200
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:01,863
I've known you
since you were very small.

201
00:20:01,932 --> 00:20:04,867
Good luck, and whatever you do,
don't make a sound.

202
00:20:04,935 --> 00:20:06,869
<i>Master Haku.</i>

203
00:20:06,937 --> 00:20:08,928
Calm down. I'm coming.

204
00:20:10,974 --> 00:20:13,101
<i>Master Haku,
Yubaba wants to see you.</i>

205
00:20:13,176 --> 00:20:17,203
I know. It's about
my mission, right?

206
00:20:28,024 --> 00:20:30,788
There's a human someplace.
We must find him.

207
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,522
Let's go this way.

208
00:20:33,597 --> 00:20:36,532
Wait for me.
Wait for me. Wait.

209
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,625
Come on. Everything's fine.

210
00:24:24,527 --> 00:24:28,258
Uh, hello. Excuse me.

211
00:24:35,271 --> 00:24:37,967
Uh, hello?

212
00:24:43,479 --> 00:24:45,777
Uh, hello. Are you Kamajii?

213
00:24:45,849 --> 00:24:48,340
Eh?

214
00:24:48,418 --> 00:24:51,182
Huh?

215
00:24:51,254 --> 00:24:56,089
Haku told me to come here
and ask you for work.

216
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,650
Could you give me a job?

217
00:25:00,964 --> 00:25:05,526
Four bath tokens at once.

218
00:25:05,602 --> 00:25:07,968
Come on. Get to work, you little runts.

219
00:25:08,037 --> 00:25:10,733
<i>Yeah, I'm Kamajii...</i>

220
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:14,402
slave to the boiler
that heats the baths.

221
00:25:14,477 --> 00:25:17,241
Move it, ya stupid soot balls.

222
00:25:17,313 --> 00:25:19,907
Please, I've gotta get a job here.

223
00:25:19,983 --> 00:25:21,917
I don't need any help.

224
00:25:21,985 --> 00:25:25,614
The place is full of soot.
I just cast a spell on them...

225
00:25:25,688 --> 00:25:28,384
<i>and I've got all
the workers I need.</i>

226
00:25:41,437 --> 00:25:44,201
Oh. Sorry.

227
00:25:47,076 --> 00:25:49,510
Wait. Just a second.

228
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:03,550
Out of the way.

229
00:26:56,045 --> 00:26:58,479
What should I do with this?

230
00:27:04,187 --> 00:27:06,587
Should I leave it here?

231
00:27:06,656 --> 00:27:09,124
Finish what you started, human.

232
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:57,005
Hmm?

233
00:28:08,785 --> 00:28:12,949
Hey, you runts. You wanna turn
back into soot?

234
00:28:13,022 --> 00:28:16,549
And you, back off. You can't just take
someone else's job.

235
00:28:16,626 --> 00:28:20,027
If they don't work, the spell wears off.
They turn back into soot.

236
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:24,430
There's no work for you here, got it?
Try somewhere else.

237
00:28:32,108 --> 00:28:36,511
You soot balls got a problem?
Get back to work!

238
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:40,310
Chow time. What's going on?

239
00:28:40,383 --> 00:28:42,647
Are you guys fighting again?

240
00:28:42,718 --> 00:28:45,448
Where's your other bowl?

241
00:28:45,521 --> 00:28:47,455
- Oh. Ahh.
- From yesterday?

242
00:28:47,523 --> 00:28:50,253
I keep telling you
to leave it out, Kamajii.

243
00:28:50,326 --> 00:28:52,351
Meal time! Take a break.

244
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:13,510
A human! You're in trouble.
You're the one everyone's looking for.

245
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:16,211
- She's my granddaughter.
- Granddaughter?

246
00:29:17,787 --> 00:29:19,721
She said she wants to work here...

247
00:29:19,789 --> 00:29:21,916
but I've got all the help I need.

248
00:29:21,991 --> 00:29:25,256
Will you take her to see Yubaba?
She's a tough little girl.

249
00:29:25,328 --> 00:29:27,262
I think she can handle it.

250
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,958
No way.
I'm not gonna risk my life.

251
00:29:30,032 --> 00:29:34,196
What if I give you
this roasted newt? Hmm?

252
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,534
It's a good one.

253
00:29:36,606 --> 00:29:40,633
If you want a job, you'll have to
make a deal with Yubaba.

254
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:43,110
She's the head honcho here.

255
00:29:43,179 --> 00:29:47,115
Give me that! Come on, little girl.
You better follow me.

256
00:29:53,156 --> 00:29:57,149
- Can't you even manage a "Yes, ma'am" or a "Thank you"?
- Yes, ma'am.

257
00:29:57,226 --> 00:29:59,160
What a dope. Hurry up.

258
00:29:59,228 --> 00:30:01,492
Yes, ma'am.

259
00:30:01,564 --> 00:30:04,362
<i>You don't need
your shoes or your socks.</i>

260
00:30:04,433 --> 00:30:06,367
<i>- Just leave 'em.</i>
- Yes, ma'am.

261
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:16,804
Thank the boiler man, you idiot.
You know, he's really sticking his neck out for you.

262
00:30:16,879 --> 00:30:20,610
Thank you, Mr. Boiler Man.

263
00:30:20,683 --> 00:30:23,447
Good luck.

264
00:30:31,761 --> 00:30:36,926
We have to go all the way to the
top floor. That's where Yubaba lives.

265
00:30:49,312 --> 00:30:52,076
<i>Get over here.</i>

266
00:30:56,419 --> 00:30:59,354
You wanna lose your nose?

267
00:31:09,532 --> 00:31:12,524
<i>More appetizers.</i>

268
00:31:12,602 --> 00:31:14,536
<i>Not spicy enough.</i>

269
00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:25,773
- We're halfway there. Just stay close.
- Okay.

270
00:31:29,418 --> 00:31:31,784
<i>Here we go.</i>

271
00:31:34,056 --> 00:31:36,524
The radish spirit.

272
00:31:42,164 --> 00:31:44,189
Sorry, sir. This elevator
doesn't go any higher.

273
00:31:44,267 --> 00:31:47,668
You'll have to take
another one. Thank you.

274
00:32:09,425 --> 00:32:12,394
- He's following us.
- Just don't look at him.

275
00:32:27,576 --> 00:32:29,976
Step out to the right, please, gentlemen.

276
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,981
I don't think they're big enough.

277
00:32:35,051 --> 00:32:36,985
Your rooms are right this way.

278
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:41,217
- Hmm. Rin?
- What?

279
00:32:43,392 --> 00:32:45,587
What's that smell?

280
00:32:45,661 --> 00:32:49,188
- It's human. You smell just like a human.
- Oh, really?

281
00:32:49,265 --> 00:32:53,429
<i>Where's it coming from, Rin?
Come on.</i>

282
00:32:53,502 --> 00:32:56,903
You're hiding something, aren't you?

283
00:32:56,972 --> 00:32:59,941
- Show it to me.
- Is this what you smell?

284
00:33:00,009 --> 00:33:02,705
Roasted... newt!

285
00:33:02,778 --> 00:33:06,145
No way, frog.
I'm saving every last bite for myself.

286
00:33:06,215 --> 00:33:09,207
Please, just a little bit.
Just give me a leg.

287
00:33:09,285 --> 00:33:13,381
If you wanna go up, pull the lever on your right.

288
00:33:13,456 --> 00:33:18,291
<i>Gimme, gimme, gimme.
How could you be so cruel?</i>

289
00:33:18,361 --> 00:33:21,888
<i>Can't you share?</i>

290
00:33:21,964 --> 00:33:24,899
<i>Let me suck on the tail. Please!</i>

291
00:33:24,967 --> 00:33:28,528
- Let me...
- Mmm.

292
00:34:58,694 --> 00:35:00,719
Aren't you even going to knock?

293
00:35:00,796 --> 00:35:04,562
You're the most pathetic little girl
I've ever seen.

294
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,769
Well, come in.

295
00:35:19,849 --> 00:35:23,250
I said, come in.

296
00:35:48,878 --> 00:35:52,041
Quiet down.
You're making a racket.

297
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,800
Excuse me. I was wondering
if you could give me a job?

298
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:26,006
I don't want to hear
such a stupid request.

299
00:36:26,081 --> 00:36:29,744
You're just a stinking,
useless weakling.

300
00:36:29,818 --> 00:36:35,085
And this is certainly
no place for humans.

301
00:36:35,157 --> 00:36:38,354
It's a bathhouse for the spirits.

302
00:36:38,427 --> 00:36:42,124
It's where they come
to replenish themselves.

303
00:36:42,197 --> 00:36:45,598
<i>And you humans
always make a mess of things.</i>

304
00:36:45,668 --> 00:36:50,605
<i>Like your parents, who gobbled up
the food of the spirits like pigs.</i>

305
00:36:50,673 --> 00:36:54,973
They got what they deserved,
and you should be punished too.

306
00:36:55,044 --> 00:37:00,949
Hmm.

307
00:37:01,016 --> 00:37:03,007
You could be a piglet.

308
00:37:03,085 --> 00:37:07,385
Or, maybe you'd prefer
a lump of coal?

309
00:37:15,464 --> 00:37:19,901
I can see you shaking. Actually,
I'm impressed you made it this far.

310
00:37:19,969 --> 00:37:23,928
But I'm sure
you didn't do it on your own.

311
00:37:24,006 --> 00:37:26,804
Let's thank whoever helped you.

312
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:31,039
Just who was it, dear?
Why don't you tell me.

313
00:37:31,113 --> 00:37:35,573
Please! Can't you give me a job?

314
00:37:35,651 --> 00:37:38,779
- Don't start that again.
- Please, I just want to work.

315
00:37:38,854 --> 00:37:43,052
Don't say that!

316
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:51,725
Why in world do you think
I should give you a job?

317
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,167
Anyone can see you're
a lazy, spoiled crybaby...

318
00:37:55,237 --> 00:37:57,797
and you have no manners.

319
00:37:57,873 --> 00:38:01,104
This is a high-class place
I'm running here.

320
00:38:01,176 --> 00:38:07,115
So there's no job for you. Now get out.
I've got all the lazy bums I need.

321
00:38:07,182 --> 00:38:12,950
Or maybe I'll give you the most difficult job I've got...

322
00:38:13,022 --> 00:38:15,456
and work you until you breathe...

323
00:38:15,524 --> 00:38:20,052
your very last breath.

324
00:38:32,007 --> 00:38:35,272
Oh, dear, you woke up the baby.

325
00:38:35,344 --> 00:38:39,075
Mommy's here.
Be a good boy now.

326
00:38:39,148 --> 00:38:41,810
Why are you still here?
I told you to leave.

327
00:38:41,884 --> 00:38:43,852
I want you to give me a job, please!

328
00:38:43,919 --> 00:38:46,513
Quiet down! You're scaring the baby.

329
00:38:46,588 --> 00:38:50,285
Ooh! Hi, sweetie. Don't be angry.

330
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:54,819
That's a good boy.

331
00:38:54,897 --> 00:38:57,229
I'm not leaving
till you give me a job.

332
00:38:57,299 --> 00:38:59,733
Okay. Okay. Just be quiet.

333
00:38:59,802 --> 00:39:04,671
Here comes Mommy.
I'm coming to get you.

334
00:39:25,194 --> 00:39:27,162
<i>That's your contract.</i>

335
00:39:27,229 --> 00:39:32,826
Sign your name away,
and I'll put you to work.

336
00:39:32,901 --> 00:39:34,926
If I hear one little
complaint out of you...

337
00:39:35,003 --> 00:39:38,200
you'll be joining
your parents in the pigpen.

338
00:39:38,273 --> 00:39:40,673
So I...
Do I sign my name here?

339
00:39:40,743 --> 00:39:44,144
<i>Just sign it.
Do you want the job or not?</i>

340
00:39:49,284 --> 00:39:51,479
I can't believe I took that oath.

341
00:39:51,553 --> 00:39:54,545
Give a job to anyone who asks.

342
00:39:56,158 --> 00:40:00,686
Ridiculous. I hate being
so nice all the time. Ha!

343
00:40:00,763 --> 00:40:03,323
<i>Are you done yet?</i>

344
00:40:07,336 --> 00:40:10,897
- So, your name's Chihiro.
<i>- Yes, ma'am.</i>

345
00:40:10,973 --> 00:40:13,771
What a pretty name.

346
00:40:22,918 --> 00:40:26,081
And it belongs to me now.

347
00:40:26,155 --> 00:40:29,181
<i>From now on, your name is Sen.
You got that?</i>

348
00:40:29,258 --> 00:40:32,056
<i>- Answer me, Sen!</i>
- Yes, ma'am.

349
00:40:32,127 --> 00:40:36,894
<i>You called for me?</i>

350
00:40:36,965 --> 00:40:40,366
<i>This girl signed a contract.
Set her up with a job.</i>

351
00:40:40,435 --> 00:40:43,268
Right. What's your name?

352
00:40:43,338 --> 00:40:47,001
What? Chih... Oh. It's Sen.

353
00:40:47,075 --> 00:40:49,475
Okay, Sen. Follow me.

354
00:40:57,152 --> 00:40:59,313
Haku, uh...

355
00:40:59,388 --> 00:41:03,586
Don't talk to me,
and address me as Master Haku.

356
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:24,502
- I don't care if Yubaba gets angry with us.
- We're not taking humans.

357
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,980
- She's already under contract.
- What?

358
00:41:27,049 --> 00:41:31,247
- I promise to work very hard.
- We are not gonna take her in our department.

359
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,398
- She'll stink up the whole place.
- We don't want her.

360
00:41:33,422 --> 00:41:36,619
Three days of eating our food,
and her smell will go away.

361
00:41:36,692 --> 00:41:42,028
If she doesn't work hard, roast her,
boil her, do whatever you want.

362
00:41:42,097 --> 00:41:44,622
Now get back to work.
Where is Rin?

363
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,134
What? Don't you dump her on me.

364
00:41:47,202 --> 00:41:50,035
- You said you wanted an assistant.
- That's perfect.

365
00:41:50,105 --> 00:41:52,300
- Give the girl to Rin.
<i>- Oh, great.</i>

366
00:41:52,374 --> 00:41:55,207
- Sen, get going.
- Right.

367
00:41:55,277 --> 00:41:58,713
Why are you picking on me?
You owe me one, Haku. You hear me?

368
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:02,546
- Have a nice day.
- Hmph.

369
00:42:02,618 --> 00:42:04,882
Come on.

370
00:42:12,895 --> 00:42:14,886
I can't believe you pulled it off.

371
00:42:14,963 --> 00:42:17,659
- Huh?
<i>- You're such a dope. I was really worried.</i>

372
00:42:17,733 --> 00:42:22,466
Now, keep on your toes,
and if you need anything, ask me. Okay?

373
00:42:22,537 --> 00:42:25,165
- Okay.
- Hmm? What's wrong?

374
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,175
I don't feel so good.

375
00:42:32,381 --> 00:42:35,373
So, this is our room.

376
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:38,044
A little food and some sleep
and you'll be fine.

377
00:42:40,389 --> 00:42:44,348
Here's your apron. You have to
wash it yourself. Your pants.

378
00:42:44,426 --> 00:42:48,226
You're so puny.

379
00:42:48,297 --> 00:42:50,390
Way too big.

380
00:42:50,465 --> 00:42:54,060
- Rin, you know Haku?
<i>- What about him?</i>

381
00:42:54,136 --> 00:42:56,400
There aren't two of him
here, are there?

382
00:42:56,471 --> 00:43:01,272
Two Hakus?
I can barely stand one. Too big.

383
00:43:01,343 --> 00:43:04,574
He's Yubaba's henchman.
Don't trust anything he says.

384
00:43:07,916 --> 00:43:10,612
<i>Let's see.</i>

385
00:43:10,686 --> 00:43:16,090
Ah, here we go.
Wh-What's wrong with you?

386
00:43:16,158 --> 00:43:19,286
Are you feeling okay?

387
00:43:19,361 --> 00:43:21,386
Quiet down. What's your problem?

388
00:43:21,463 --> 00:43:24,694
It's the new girl.
She doesn't feel so good.

389
00:44:56,291 --> 00:44:59,886
Meet me at the bridge.
I'll take you to your parents.

390
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:49,633
My shoes are gone.

391
00:45:51,913 --> 00:45:54,438
Huh?

392
00:46:00,055 --> 00:46:02,046
Thank you.

393
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:11,085
Follow me.

394
00:47:20,869 --> 00:47:25,465
We don't have much time.
If you're found here, you'll be turned into a pig yourself.

395
00:47:27,442 --> 00:47:32,004
You must never come here without me. Understand?

396
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,480
I understand.

397
00:47:54,636 --> 00:47:59,198
Mom, Dad, are you all right?
It's me, Sen. Hey, wake up!

398
00:47:59,274 --> 00:48:01,674
<i>Mom! Dad!</i>

399
00:48:05,413 --> 00:48:07,677
What's wrong with them?
Are they sick?

400
00:48:07,749 --> 00:48:10,240
No. They ate too much.
They're sleeping it off.

401
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:12,718
<i>They don't remember being human.</i>

402
00:48:12,787 --> 00:48:15,221
<i>So look hard. It's up to you
to remember which ones they are.</i>

403
00:48:19,594 --> 00:48:21,634
Don't you worry, I promise
I'll get you out of here.

404
00:48:21,663 --> 00:48:25,463
So just don't get any fatter
or they'll eat you!

405
00:48:32,841 --> 00:48:35,639
Here are your clothes. Hide them.

406
00:48:37,979 --> 00:48:42,575
- I thought they'd been thrown away.
- You'll need them to get home.

407
00:48:47,689 --> 00:48:50,590
My good-bye card's still here.

408
00:48:53,161 --> 00:48:57,621
Chihiro. Chihiro.
That's my name, isn't it?

409
00:48:57,699 --> 00:49:00,099
That's how Yubaba controls you...
by stealing your name.

410
00:49:00,168 --> 00:49:02,398
So hold on to that card.
Keep it hidden.

411
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:05,371
While you're here,
you must call yourself Sen.

412
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,432
I can't believe I forgot my name.
She almost took it from me.

413
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:13,311
If you completely forget it,
you'll never find your way home.

414
00:49:13,381 --> 00:49:15,906
I've tried everything
to remember mine.

415
00:49:15,984 --> 00:49:17,918
You can't remember your name?

416
00:49:17,986 --> 00:49:21,387
No. But for some reason,
I remember yours.

417
00:49:23,491 --> 00:49:26,892
Here you go. Eat this.
You must be hungry.

418
00:49:26,961 --> 00:49:30,954
- No.
- I put a spell on it so it'll give you back your strength.

419
00:49:31,032 --> 00:49:33,592
Just eat it.

420
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:11,470
Have some more. You'll be all right.

421
00:50:22,784 --> 00:50:25,776
I've got to go now.
I'll be back to help you soon.

422
00:50:25,854 --> 00:50:30,450
- Just stay out of trouble.
- Thank you, Haku. You're a good friend.

423
00:50:44,672 --> 00:50:46,663
<i>Haku.</i>

424
00:50:49,778 --> 00:50:52,770
<i>He's a dragon?</i>

425
00:51:17,539 --> 00:51:19,404
Huh?

426
00:52:05,253 --> 00:52:09,280
- Where were you, Sen? I was really worried.
- I'm sorry.

427
00:52:18,566 --> 00:52:20,431
Out of my way.

428
00:52:30,011 --> 00:52:32,946
<i>Gee, Sen...</i>

429
00:52:33,014 --> 00:52:36,006
haven't you ever worked
a day in your life?

430
00:52:36,084 --> 00:52:38,575
- Rin and Sen, you get the big tub today.
- What?

431
00:52:38,653 --> 00:52:42,851
- Hey, that's frog work.
- Orders from the top. So quit your complaining.

432
00:53:03,511 --> 00:53:06,105
Hello. Aren't you
getting wet out there?

433
00:53:10,218 --> 00:53:13,210
<i>- Sen, hurry up.</i>
- Coming.

434
00:53:13,288 --> 00:53:15,882
I'll leave the door open for you.

435
00:53:42,951 --> 00:53:45,010
- Heard you got the big tub, Rin.
<i>- Leave me alone.</i>

436
00:53:48,723 --> 00:53:51,556
Those jerks. They haven't cleaned
this tub in months.

437
00:54:03,671 --> 00:54:07,402
<i>We only use this tub
for our really filthy guests.</i>

438
00:54:07,475 --> 00:54:11,411
Disgusting. This sludge is so caked on,
it'll take days to scrub off.

439
00:54:11,479 --> 00:54:14,175
Rin, Sen, you've got
some customers on the way.

440
00:54:14,248 --> 00:54:17,649
Wait! Give us a minute.
This is clearly harassment.

441
00:54:17,719 --> 00:54:22,747
We'll have to soak it off. Get an herbal
soak token from the foreman.

442
00:54:22,824 --> 00:54:25,520
A what?

443
00:54:25,593 --> 00:54:29,620
- An herbal soak token.
- All right.

444
00:54:29,697 --> 00:54:31,722
Hey, Rin, what's a foreman?

445
00:54:34,302 --> 00:54:38,261
Hmm. Something's coming.
I wonder what?

446
00:54:47,081 --> 00:54:52,280
What useless scum
is sleeking around in the rain?

447
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:20,347
I can't waste a token on you.
Relax. Good morning.

448
00:55:20,415 --> 00:55:22,679
Enjoy. Have a nice bath.

449
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:26,379
- For the radish spirit.
- One sulfur soak.

450
00:55:26,454 --> 00:55:29,423
Why are you still standing here?
Scrub it yourself.

451
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:33,290
I'm not giving you a token.
Relax. Good morning.

452
00:55:33,361 --> 00:55:37,889
- I said scrub it yourself.
- But I was told it has to have an herbal soak.

453
00:55:37,965 --> 00:55:43,904
Well, that's too bad. Mugwort bath?
Relax and enjoy it.

454
00:55:49,977 --> 00:55:52,775
Hmm?

455
00:55:52,847 --> 00:55:56,305
Foreman speaking. Oh, yes. What?

456
00:55:56,384 --> 00:56:00,184
- Thank you very much.
<i>- Get back here!</i>

457
00:56:00,254 --> 00:56:02,449
- Hey! Wait a minute.
- What's going on?

458
00:56:02,523 --> 00:56:05,583
- Nothing. Everything's fine.
- We have an intruder.

459
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:10,290
- Is it a human?
- I'm not quite sure. Figure it out and report back.

460
00:56:10,364 --> 00:56:12,924
Wow, Sen. You got a really good one.

461
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,731
Clip this on, then let go.

462
00:56:16,804 --> 00:56:19,967
It goes straight to Kamajii,
then he sends us our water.

463
00:56:24,746 --> 00:56:27,738
You pull on this to start
the water flowing. Give it a try.

464
00:56:36,657 --> 00:56:40,650
- Uh, you're such a klutz.
- Yuck! What's in this water?

465
00:56:40,728 --> 00:56:43,561
Dried worm salt.
It's supposed to be good for you.

466
00:56:43,631 --> 00:56:48,091
And with water this murky,
you can't see all the sludge in the tub.

467
00:56:48,169 --> 00:56:51,935
Yank it again
when the bath is full, it'll stop.

468
00:56:52,006 --> 00:56:55,601
You can let go of the rope now.
I'll get us some breakfast.

469
00:56:55,676 --> 00:56:57,667
Okay.

470
00:57:18,199 --> 00:57:20,793
Ow!

471
00:57:25,706 --> 00:57:28,436
Uh, sir.
The bath's not ready yet.

472
00:57:31,913 --> 00:57:36,714
There's so many.

473
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:42,983
- What? They're all for me?
- Uh... Uh...

474
00:57:43,057 --> 00:57:45,582
Thanks, but I don't need any more.

475
00:57:47,762 --> 00:57:50,128
- Uh...
- No. I only need one.

476
00:58:05,146 --> 00:58:07,171
- Oh, Yubaba.
- It's a stink spirit.

477
00:58:07,248 --> 00:58:11,617
- And apparently, it's an extra smelly one.
- He's headed for the bridge.

478
00:58:14,155 --> 00:58:18,114
We're closed.
Go away. We're not open.

479
00:58:18,192 --> 00:58:20,786
- Go! Please, go. Leave us.
<i>- There's no one here.</i>

480
00:58:23,664 --> 00:58:27,896
Hmm. Something's fishy.
That doesn't seem like a stink spirit to me.

481
00:58:27,969 --> 00:58:30,369
But we have no choice.
Go greet him.

482
00:58:30,438 --> 00:58:34,875
<i>Just give him a bath and get him
out of here as fast as you can.</i>

483
00:58:34,942 --> 00:58:38,878
Everybody go back to your rooms.
Back to your rooms.

484
00:58:38,946 --> 00:58:42,939
<i>- Don't worry about a thing. Everybody just be calm.</i>
- Sen, Yubaba wants to see you.

485
00:58:43,017 --> 00:58:46,214
- Yes, sir.
- Sen, don't mess this up.

486
00:58:46,287 --> 00:58:49,620
Take this guest to the big tub
and take care of him.

487
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:52,625
- But-But, I...
- No buts, or I'll turn you into coal.

488
00:58:52,693 --> 00:58:55,753
- You hear me?
- It's here.

489
00:59:05,506 --> 00:59:08,236
Hands down. You'll insult our guest.

490
00:59:16,017 --> 00:59:20,477
Look about you, customer.
Welcome to our baths.

491
00:59:22,523 --> 00:59:25,321
Oh, it's money.

492
00:59:25,393 --> 00:59:29,386
- Sen, take the nice customer's money.
- Yes, ma'am.

493
00:59:37,805 --> 00:59:42,401
<i>Don't make him wait.
Get him to the bath.</i>

494
00:59:42,476 --> 00:59:44,944
This way.

495
01:00:00,161 --> 01:00:03,756
- Get out of my way!
- Sen!

496
01:00:10,905 --> 01:00:12,839
Our food!

497
01:00:12,907 --> 01:00:15,034
Open your windows, all of them!

498
01:00:15,109 --> 01:00:17,009
<i>Quickly!</i>

499
01:00:58,219 --> 01:01:00,619
What? Just a minute, sir.

500
01:01:05,126 --> 01:01:07,822
Disgusting?

501
01:01:07,895 --> 01:01:11,023
- I don't think it's very funny.
- Let's see what she'll do next.

502
01:01:15,503 --> 01:01:17,971
Look. She wants to refill the tub.

503
01:01:18,039 --> 01:01:21,031
Oh, dear! She's gonna waste
all our good water!

504
01:01:23,377 --> 01:01:25,937
Ow!

505
01:01:33,254 --> 01:01:35,814
Hmm. Who gave her
all the bath tokens?

506
01:01:35,890 --> 01:01:37,824
Don't look at me. I didn't do it.

507
01:02:20,301 --> 01:02:22,792
Oh, no! That's our best
herbal formula!

508
01:02:48,729 --> 01:02:50,788
Sen! Sen, where are you?

509
01:02:50,865 --> 01:02:53,265
Over here!

510
01:02:53,334 --> 01:02:56,303
Don't worry. St-Stay right where you are.
I'm coming to help you.

511
01:02:56,370 --> 01:02:58,895
You're gonna be fine.
I won't let him hurt you.

512
01:02:58,973 --> 01:03:02,739
I think he needs help. It feels like
there's a thorn in his side.

513
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:05,438
<i>- A thorn?</i>
- It won't come out!

514
01:03:05,513 --> 01:03:09,415
What's that?
He has a thorn? Hmm.

515
01:03:09,483 --> 01:03:12,350
- Get the staff down there. Step on it!
- Huh?

516
01:03:12,419 --> 01:03:15,445
Right, right, right!
Get downstairs! Help her! You!

517
01:03:15,523 --> 01:03:17,491
<i>- All of you!</i>
- Listen to me.

518
01:03:17,558 --> 01:03:19,958
That's no stink spirit
we have on our hands...

519
01:03:22,396 --> 01:03:24,591
- Grab onto this rope.
- Wait!

520
01:03:33,374 --> 01:03:36,309
- Mmm. Hold on tight.
- Got it.

521
01:03:36,377 --> 01:03:38,277
- Hurry up, now.
- Get in there!

522
01:03:38,345 --> 01:03:40,279
Everyone get in there
and help them.

523
01:03:40,347 --> 01:03:42,247
We've got it tied on!

524
01:03:43,751 --> 01:03:47,152
Everyone, ready on my command.

525
01:03:47,221 --> 01:03:49,781
And... heave!

526
01:03:49,857 --> 01:03:52,291
And... heave!

527
01:03:52,359 --> 01:03:54,793
- Heave!
- And...

528
01:03:54,862 --> 01:03:57,296
<i>- heave!</i>
- Heave!

529
01:03:57,364 --> 01:03:59,798
And heave!

530
01:03:59,867 --> 01:04:03,803
<i>And heave!</i>

531
01:04:03,871 --> 01:04:05,896
A bicycle?

532
01:04:05,973 --> 01:04:07,907
Thought so.

533
01:04:07,975 --> 01:04:09,909
Get ready, now!

534
01:04:09,977 --> 01:04:13,003
<i>- Heave!</i>
- Heave!

535
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:15,105
<i>Heave!</i>

536
01:04:44,144 --> 01:04:46,772
Sen! Sen, where are you?

537
01:04:57,124 --> 01:04:59,649
Well done.

538
01:05:04,965 --> 01:05:06,956
Huh?

539
01:05:18,145 --> 01:05:21,012
Ahh!

540
01:05:29,189 --> 01:05:31,783
- Gold!
- Gold!

541
01:05:31,859 --> 01:05:34,089
Hey, wait!
That's company property!

542
01:05:34,161 --> 01:05:36,095
<i>- Stop!</i>
- Back off!

543
01:05:36,163 --> 01:05:38,859
Our guest is still here, you idiots!

544
01:05:43,771 --> 01:05:46,467
Sen, you're in our guest's way.
Step aside.

545
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:49,168
- Yes, ma'am.
- Open the main gates! Make way!

546
01:06:15,736 --> 01:06:20,901
Sen, you did great!
We made so much money!

547
01:06:20,974 --> 01:06:25,172
That spirit is rich and powerful.
Everyone, learn from Sen.

548
01:06:25,245 --> 01:06:28,214
<i>Sake's on the house tonight.</i>

549
01:06:28,282 --> 01:06:31,683
<i>But first, hand over all the gold you picked up.</i>

550
01:06:31,752 --> 01:06:35,153
- That's not fair!
- How stingy! That's no fair!

551
01:06:43,430 --> 01:06:45,660
Here.

552
01:06:45,733 --> 01:06:49,225
- I swiped a dumpling for you.
- Thank you.

553
01:06:49,303 --> 01:06:51,794
What a day. Mmm.

554
01:06:53,407 --> 01:06:56,638
- Rin, have you seen Haku?
- Not Haku again.

555
01:06:57,978 --> 01:06:59,946
He just disappears sometimes.

556
01:07:00,013 --> 01:07:03,915
Rumor has it he runs around
doing Yubaba's dirty work.

557
01:07:03,984 --> 01:07:06,851
- Does he really?
<i>- Lights out, Rin.</i>

558
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,820
Fine.

559
01:07:33,046 --> 01:07:35,674
There's so much water.
It looks like a sea.

560
01:07:35,749 --> 01:07:38,775
<i>What'd you expect
after all that rain?</i>

561
01:07:40,888 --> 01:07:45,188
I've gotta get out of this place.
Someday, I'm getting on that train.

562
01:07:55,803 --> 01:07:58,294
Mmm.

563
01:08:07,548 --> 01:08:09,982
What's wrong?

564
01:08:29,269 --> 01:08:31,203
Ah!

565
01:08:34,308 --> 01:08:36,333
Hmm.
Uh-uh.

566
01:08:38,078 --> 01:08:40,410
Huh?
Ahh!

567
01:08:40,481 --> 01:08:42,779
It's gold! Huh?

568
01:08:44,518 --> 01:08:46,863
What do you think you're doing?
You're not allowed in there.

569
01:08:46,887 --> 01:08:49,253
The bath's closed.
Get out, you! Get out of there!

570
01:08:54,228 --> 01:08:57,061
Ooh! Oh! More gold!

571
01:08:57,130 --> 01:08:59,030
Are you... Are you...
Are you giving them to me?

572
01:09:04,171 --> 01:09:06,731
Wait. You can make gold?

573
01:09:09,276 --> 01:09:11,267
Ahh.

574
01:09:11,345 --> 01:09:13,279
Uh, gimme!

575
01:09:14,948 --> 01:09:17,348
Ahh.

576
01:09:20,721 --> 01:09:23,155
What's going on in there?

577
01:09:24,324 --> 01:09:26,451
It's way past bedtime. Come on!

578
01:09:26,527 --> 01:09:29,462
Wh...

579
01:09:29,530 --> 01:09:33,398
Hey, boss, up here.
I'm hungry. Starving!

580
01:09:33,467 --> 01:09:35,697
<i>- And I want you to serve me.</i>
- I know that voice.

581
01:09:35,769 --> 01:09:37,669
<i>Here, I'll pay you up front.</i>

582
01:09:37,738 --> 01:09:40,605
And... I wanna take a bath too.

583
01:09:40,674 --> 01:09:42,801
Why don't you wake everyone up?

584
01:09:48,448 --> 01:09:51,144
Mom, Dad, I got a gift
from the river spirit!

585
01:09:51,218 --> 01:09:53,914
Maybe if you eat it,
it'll break the spell.

586
01:09:58,725 --> 01:10:01,319
Which ones are you?

587
01:10:01,395 --> 01:10:03,488
Mom, Dad!

588
01:10:12,072 --> 01:10:14,632
Bad dream.

589
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:18,642
Rin?

590
01:10:21,548 --> 01:10:23,482
Where is everybody?

591
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:32,020
Wow. It really is a sea.

592
01:10:33,226 --> 01:10:35,717
<i>There's Mom and Dad's pigpen.</i>

593
01:10:37,197 --> 01:10:40,291
I sure hope they're doing
all right over there.

594
01:10:44,137 --> 01:10:46,697
Kamajii lit the boiler already?

595
01:10:46,773 --> 01:10:49,571
How long was I asleep?

596
01:10:49,643 --> 01:10:52,043
Hurry up!

597
01:10:52,112 --> 01:10:55,047
Come on, he's starving!
Can't you cook any faster?

598
01:10:55,115 --> 01:10:59,142
Serve everything you've got, even leftovers if you have to.
Hurry up! He's starving!

599
01:11:01,154 --> 01:11:03,588
<i>- Hey, Sen.</i>
- Oh, Rin.

600
01:11:03,657 --> 01:11:06,251
I was just coming
to wake you up. Look.

601
01:11:06,326 --> 01:11:09,727
It's real gold.
There's a new guest here who's loaded.

602
01:11:09,796 --> 01:11:12,230
He's giving gold away
by the handfuls!

603
01:11:22,709 --> 01:11:26,304
Just keep the food coming.
I wanna eat everything!

604
01:11:29,149 --> 01:11:31,617
Hmm. Who is the guest?

605
01:11:31,685 --> 01:11:35,621
Oh, who cares? Come on,
before Yubaba wakes up.

606
01:11:35,689 --> 01:11:37,623
I'm going to go look for Haku.

607
01:11:37,691 --> 01:11:40,717
Oh! Would you quit
worrying about Haku?

608
01:11:40,794 --> 01:11:43,058
- Come on, Sen. Let's go get some gold.
- Come on, Rin!

609
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:45,291
- Let's go get some more!
- You bet!

610
01:11:45,365 --> 01:11:47,265
<i>Hey, wait for me!</i>

611
01:12:04,618 --> 01:12:08,076
<i>Where is Haku?</i>

612
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:13,849
He better get here before I forget
what my parents look like.

613
01:12:13,927 --> 01:12:16,623
I sure hope Dad hasn't gotten too fat.

614
01:12:29,509 --> 01:12:31,875
Hmm?

615
01:12:35,215 --> 01:12:37,115
Haku?

616
01:12:44,791 --> 01:12:47,555
It's Haku! He's back!

617
01:12:51,198 --> 01:12:53,632
Are birds chasing him?

618
01:13:04,077 --> 01:13:07,205
Haku! Fight 'em! Come on!

619
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:09,976
He's hurt!

620
01:13:10,050 --> 01:13:13,042
<i>Haku, this way!</i>

621
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,747
Aah!

622
01:13:28,001 --> 01:13:30,401
Huh? It's just paper.

623
01:13:58,865 --> 01:14:01,197
Haku, you're bleeding.

624
01:14:06,873 --> 01:14:11,810
Hold still. Those paper things are gone now.
You're going to be all right.

625
01:14:24,758 --> 01:14:29,718
He went in that top window.
I've got to get there before he bleeds to death!

626
01:14:44,277 --> 01:14:47,838
Oh, hey, everybody, bow down.

627
01:14:47,914 --> 01:14:49,848
Welcome, rich man.

628
01:14:57,991 --> 01:15:01,825
Give me some dough!
Give me some tips!

629
01:15:01,895 --> 01:15:06,025
I'll do anything for you!
Just give me some tips!

630
01:15:08,535 --> 01:15:11,402
Hey, what are you doing?

631
01:15:11,471 --> 01:15:14,599
- Going upstairs.
- No, you're not.

632
01:15:14,674 --> 01:15:16,369
Huh? Aah! Blood!

633
01:15:20,113 --> 01:15:22,547
Get out of the way!
Our guest is coming through here!

634
01:15:24,150 --> 01:15:26,141
Thank you for helping me earlier.

635
01:15:26,219 --> 01:15:29,188
- Don't talk to him, you stinking hum...
- Hey!

636
01:15:49,643 --> 01:15:52,271
I don't want any, but thanks.

637
01:15:54,981 --> 01:15:57,916
I'm sorry,
but I'm in a really big hurry.

638
01:16:09,329 --> 01:16:12,127
- Hey, there! Hey! Get back! Get back now!
- Ow!

639
01:16:12,198 --> 01:16:14,996
Everybody, out!

640
01:16:15,068 --> 01:16:17,002
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, sir.

641
01:16:17,070 --> 01:16:20,335
You'll have to excuse the little girl.
She's just a human.

642
01:16:23,443 --> 01:16:25,604
- Wipe that smile off your face.
- What?

643
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:27,738
- You're still smiling.
- No, I'm not.

644
01:17:21,434 --> 01:17:23,334
Aah!

645
01:17:54,234 --> 01:17:56,134
Huh?

646
01:18:01,274 --> 01:18:03,174
It's Yubaba!

647
01:19:15,515 --> 01:19:17,676
<i>We're in a big mess.</i>

648
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:20,218
<i>I found out who
our rich customer is.</i>

649
01:19:20,286 --> 01:19:23,153
<i>He's a No-Face!
It's all your fault. You're so greedy.</i>

650
01:19:23,223 --> 01:19:27,353
<i>You attract terrible guests.
All right, I'm on my way.</i>

651
01:19:27,427 --> 01:19:30,885
<i>Don't let him eat anyone else
till I get down there.</i>

652
01:19:30,964 --> 01:19:34,422
Haku is bleeding
all over the carpet.

653
01:19:34,501 --> 01:19:37,436
<i>Get him out of here.
He'll be dead soon anyway.</i>

654
01:19:55,288 --> 01:19:57,586
Ahh.

655
01:19:59,559 --> 01:20:02,960
Hi, sweetie.
Hiding under the cushions again?

656
01:20:06,666 --> 01:20:11,000
Oh, I woke you,
and you were sound asleep.

657
01:20:11,070 --> 01:20:14,039
I'm sorry.
Let me give you a kiss.

658
01:20:16,976 --> 01:20:18,876
Go back to sleep, now.

659
01:20:48,374 --> 01:20:50,365
Ow! Let go of me!

660
01:20:50,443 --> 01:20:54,004
Wow, you're a big baby.
Would you mind letting go of me?

661
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:57,811
- I'm in a really big hurry.
- You came in here to make me sick.

662
01:20:57,884 --> 01:21:01,047
- Huh?
- You're a bad germ from outside, aren't you?

663
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,816
I'm not a germ, I'm a human.

664
01:21:03,890 --> 01:21:05,824
Now, would you please let go of me?

665
01:21:05,892 --> 01:21:08,554
You'll get sick if you go outside.

666
01:21:08,628 --> 01:21:10,562
So stay here and play with me.

667
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:13,155
- You won't get sick.
- Yes, you will.

668
01:21:13,233 --> 01:21:15,167
That's why I've never left this room.

669
01:21:15,235 --> 01:21:18,033
Staying in this room
is what'll make you sick.

670
01:21:18,104 --> 01:21:22,006
Listen, someone very important
to me is terribly hurt.

671
01:21:22,075 --> 01:21:24,976
I've got to go right now,
so please let go of me.

672
01:21:25,044 --> 01:21:28,036
If you go I'll cry,
and Mama will hear me...

673
01:21:28,114 --> 01:21:30,480
and Mama will come in here and kill you.

674
01:21:30,550 --> 01:21:33,986
- Play with me, or I'll break your arm.
- That hurts!

675
01:21:34,053 --> 01:21:36,112
Please! I'll play with you later, okay?

676
01:21:36,189 --> 01:21:40,353
No, I wanna play now!

677
01:21:40,426 --> 01:21:44,192
Germs! I've got germs, see?

678
01:21:55,375 --> 01:21:57,366
Haku!

679
01:21:57,443 --> 01:22:00,742
What are you doing? Get away!
Get back! Haku, are you okay?

680
01:22:00,813 --> 01:22:02,804
Can you hear me?

681
01:22:02,882 --> 01:22:05,248
Shut your mouth! Haku!

682
01:22:08,221 --> 01:22:11,748
Get back!

683
01:22:13,926 --> 01:22:16,724
Stop it!

684
01:22:30,643 --> 01:22:34,579
I'm not afraid of germs.
If you don't play with me, I'll cry.

685
01:22:34,647 --> 01:22:36,581
Please don't cry. Just wait.

686
01:22:36,649 --> 01:22:39,675
Right now, or I'll start crying.

687
01:22:41,921 --> 01:22:43,855
Don't cry! Don't cry!

688
01:22:43,923 --> 01:22:46,824
What a spoiled brat!

689
01:22:46,893 --> 01:22:49,555
Shut your big mouth!

690
01:22:49,629 --> 01:22:51,790
You're a bit of a porker, aren't you?

691
01:22:58,438 --> 01:23:01,498
- Hmm. Still see-through.
- Mama?

692
01:23:01,574 --> 01:23:06,671
You pea-brain. Can't you even tell me
from your own mother?

693
01:23:13,786 --> 01:23:17,313
There, now. Your body
matches your brain.

694
01:23:17,390 --> 01:23:20,655
Let's see.
What else can we mess with?

695
01:23:38,711 --> 01:23:40,645
This is our little secret.

696
01:23:40,713 --> 01:23:43,511
You tell anyone else,
and I'll rip your mouth out.

697
01:23:45,251 --> 01:23:49,119
- Who are you?
- Zaneba. I'm Yubaba's twin sister.

698
01:23:49,188 --> 01:23:52,817
It was nice of you to lead me
straight to this dragon's hiding place.

699
01:23:52,892 --> 01:23:54,826
Now, hand him over to me.

700
01:23:54,894 --> 01:23:57,385
What do you want with Haku?
He's badly hurt.

701
01:23:57,463 --> 01:24:01,297
Too bad. He stole my solid gold seal.

702
01:24:01,367 --> 01:24:04,029
It's magic and powerful,
and I want it back!

703
01:24:04,103 --> 01:24:07,004
Haku wouldn't steal.
He's a good person.

704
01:24:07,073 --> 01:24:11,203
Huh! Do you know why he became
my sister's apprentice?

705
01:24:11,277 --> 01:24:15,714
To steal her magic secrets,
and now he's stolen my magic too.

706
01:24:15,782 --> 01:24:19,946
<i>He's a greedy little thief.
There's nothing good about him.</i>

707
01:24:20,019 --> 01:24:24,979
Step aside, little girl.
I'm going to take my seal back from him.

708
01:24:25,057 --> 01:24:30,188
There's a spell on the seal,
and anyone who steals it will die.

709
01:24:30,263 --> 01:24:33,198
No, you can't!

710
01:24:39,872 --> 01:24:43,364
You idiots! What's your problem?

711
01:24:43,443 --> 01:24:47,243
<i>Keep quiet. I don't want my sister
coming up here.</i>

712
01:24:53,052 --> 01:24:55,213
Ow. A paper cut.

713
01:24:55,521 --> 01:24:57,682
Haku, we're falling!

714
01:25:17,276 --> 01:25:19,176
Haku!

715
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:50,334
- What's going on here? Sen, be careful! Stay back!
- Haku!

716
01:25:51,644 --> 01:25:54,613
Are you okay? Haku!

717
01:25:57,683 --> 01:26:00,914
What's wrong with you?

718
01:26:03,289 --> 01:26:05,723
This looks serious.

719
01:26:07,426 --> 01:26:10,623
Haku, don't give up!
What do we do? Is he dying?

720
01:26:10,696 --> 01:26:14,029
It looks like he's bleeding
from the inside.

721
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:18,503
- From the inside?
- I think so. Maybe he swallowed something.

722
01:26:18,571 --> 01:26:22,268
Haku, I got this gift
from the river spirit.

723
01:26:22,341 --> 01:26:24,366
Eat it. Maybe it'll help.

724
01:26:26,479 --> 01:26:28,879
Come on! Open your mouth!

725
01:26:28,948 --> 01:26:31,712
Please, Haku! Eat it!

726
01:26:33,352 --> 01:26:35,286
See? It's okay.

727
01:26:35,354 --> 01:26:37,618
Medicine from the river spirit.

728
01:26:37,690 --> 01:26:40,955
Open your mouth. That's it.

729
01:26:44,163 --> 01:26:46,529
Got it.

730
01:26:46,599 --> 01:26:48,760
Now swallow.

731
01:27:06,352 --> 01:27:09,378
Sen, look there!

732
01:27:20,032 --> 01:27:23,763
- The gold seal!
- Get that black slug! Over there! Get it!

733
01:27:23,836 --> 01:27:26,669
<i>Get it!
Get it!</i>

734
01:27:40,019 --> 01:27:43,477
<i>You killed it?
Those things are bad luck.</i>

735
01:27:43,556 --> 01:27:46,116
Hurry, before it rubs off on you!

736
01:27:46,192 --> 01:27:49,684
<i>Put your thumbs
and forefingers together.</i>

737
01:27:49,762 --> 01:27:54,165
- Evil, be gone!
- Haku stole this seal from Yubaba's sister.

738
01:27:54,233 --> 01:27:57,168
Zaneba's solid gold
monogrammed seal.

739
01:27:57,236 --> 01:27:59,932
<i>That's as powerful as it gets.</i>

740
01:28:02,141 --> 01:28:04,075
Look! He's changed back.

741
01:28:04,143 --> 01:28:06,077
Help me. What do we do?

742
01:28:08,214 --> 01:28:10,774
Haku! Haku, wake up!

743
01:28:12,852 --> 01:28:14,911
Zaneba put a curse on the seal.

744
01:28:14,987 --> 01:28:18,787
That's strong magic.
It's made him gravely ill.

745
01:28:28,134 --> 01:28:30,932
That should make him
more comfortable.

746
01:28:33,673 --> 01:28:37,268
Poor Haku. He's had it
hard ever since he got here.

747
01:28:37,343 --> 01:28:41,404
He just showed up
out of nowhere, just like you did.

748
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:45,712
<i>But he got mixed up with Yubaba.
He took a job as her apprentice.</i>

749
01:28:45,785 --> 01:28:48,379
<i>I warned him it was too dangerous.
"Just quit.</i>

750
01:28:48,454 --> 01:28:50,786
<i>Go back home, "I told him.</i>

751
01:28:50,856 --> 01:28:54,952
<i>But he said for some reason
he had no home to return to.</i>

752
01:28:55,027 --> 01:28:57,291
<i>Once Yubaba
got control over him...</i>

753
01:28:57,363 --> 01:29:01,197
<i>his face turned pale
and his eyes turned steely.</i>

754
01:29:01,267 --> 01:29:04,498
<i>He's never been the same.</i>

755
01:29:04,570 --> 01:29:08,563
Kamajii, what if I take
the gold seal back to Zaneba?

756
01:29:08,641 --> 01:29:12,304
I could give back the seal
and apologize to her for Haku.

757
01:29:12,378 --> 01:29:14,437
Can you tell me
where Zaneba lives?

758
01:29:14,513 --> 01:29:16,845
You'd go to Zaneba's?

759
01:29:16,916 --> 01:29:20,408
- It might help, but she's one dangerous witch.
- Please?

760
01:29:20,486 --> 01:29:24,650
Haku helped me before.
Now I wanna help him.

761
01:29:24,724 --> 01:29:26,817
Hmm.

762
01:29:26,892 --> 01:29:32,091
I know how you can get there,
but you'll have to get back on your own.

763
01:29:32,164 --> 01:29:34,655
Wait here.

764
01:29:34,734 --> 01:29:39,364
Let's see, now. I know it's
around here somewhere.

765
01:29:39,438 --> 01:29:43,101
Everyone, I need my shoes
and clothes, please.

766
01:29:44,977 --> 01:29:47,468
I guess my parents will have to wait.

767
01:29:51,684 --> 01:29:54,346
Sen! I've looked everywhere for you.

768
01:29:57,089 --> 01:29:59,216
- Rin!
- There's blood everywhere.

769
01:29:59,291 --> 01:30:02,624
What's going on here?
Who are those guys?

770
01:30:02,695 --> 01:30:05,994
I picked up some new friends. See?

771
01:30:06,065 --> 01:30:09,466
- Everyone's looking for you. Yubaba is furious.
- Huh?

772
01:30:09,535 --> 01:30:13,232
The guy with all the gold turned out
to be a monster called "No-Face."

773
01:30:13,305 --> 01:30:16,433
And he says that <i>you</i>
let him into the bathhouse.

774
01:30:18,878 --> 01:30:20,812
I did let him in.

775
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:22,848
Are you serious?

776
01:30:22,915 --> 01:30:24,974
Yeah. I thought he was a customer.

777
01:30:25,050 --> 01:30:28,019
What? He's a monster.
He's already swallowed three people.

778
01:30:28,087 --> 01:30:31,716
Found it! Here it is, Sen.

779
01:30:31,791 --> 01:30:36,251
- Hey, we're busy, boiler man.
- You can use this.

780
01:30:36,328 --> 01:30:39,525
You've got train tickets?
Uh, how did you get a hold of them?

781
01:30:39,598 --> 01:30:42,158
I've been saving them
for 40 years.

782
01:30:42,234 --> 01:30:45,897
Now, listen carefully. The train stop
you want is called Swamp Bottom.

783
01:30:45,971 --> 01:30:48,371
- Swamp Bottom?
<i>- That's where Zaneba lives.</i>

784
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:50,374
<i>- The sixth stop.</i>
- Sixth stop.

785
01:30:50,442 --> 01:30:54,037
Make sure you get it right.
The train used to run in both directions...

786
01:30:54,113 --> 01:30:56,138
but these days it's a one-way ride.

787
01:30:56,215 --> 01:30:58,149
Still want to go?

788
01:30:58,217 --> 01:31:02,813
Yep. I'll walk back along the tracks.

789
01:31:02,888 --> 01:31:06,949
- Sen, what about No-Face?
- I'll take care of that now.

790
01:31:07,026 --> 01:31:10,962
Haku, I'll be back soon.
Just hold on.

791
01:31:11,030 --> 01:31:13,464
What's going on?

792
01:31:13,532 --> 01:31:16,330
Something you wouldn't recognize.
It's called "love."

793
01:31:24,043 --> 01:31:26,841
- He just keeps getting bigger!
- I'm scared.

794
01:31:26,912 --> 01:31:29,346
- I don't wanna be eaten by it.
- It's her.

795
01:31:37,356 --> 01:31:40,325
Oh, Sen, thank goodness.
Yubaba can't hold him off much longer.

796
01:31:42,695 --> 01:31:44,686
<i>There's no need to get upset.</i>

797
01:31:44,763 --> 01:31:48,358
<i>I'm sure they'll find Sen somewhere.</i>

798
01:31:48,434 --> 01:31:50,629
<i>Where is Sen? I want Sen!</i>

799
01:31:50,703 --> 01:31:52,603
Hurry! This way!

800
01:31:58,210 --> 01:32:01,509
- Madam, Sen is here now.
- Finally!

801
01:32:01,580 --> 01:32:06,449
Sen has arrived, sir. She'll be
with you in just a few minutes.

802
01:32:06,518 --> 01:32:10,420
He's destroying everything. It's costing us a fortune.

803
01:32:10,489 --> 01:32:14,448
So suck up to him and get every last
speck of gold he's...

804
01:32:16,528 --> 01:32:19,964
Ew! What's that dirty mouse doing here?

805
01:32:20,032 --> 01:32:23,490
Huh? He's your...
He doesn't look familiar?

806
01:32:23,569 --> 01:32:28,063
Familiar? Don't be stupid.
Now, get in there.

807
01:32:29,575 --> 01:32:32,066
Here's Sen.

808
01:32:32,144 --> 01:32:35,375
Will Sen be all right
in there by herself?

809
01:32:35,447 --> 01:32:38,382
- You wanna take her place? Hmph!
- Huh?

810
01:32:57,970 --> 01:33:01,064
Try this. It's delicious.

811
01:33:03,008 --> 01:33:07,172
Want some gold? I'm not giving it
to anybody else.

812
01:33:10,783 --> 01:33:14,310
Come closer, Sen.
What would you like?

813
01:33:14,386 --> 01:33:16,718
Just name it.

814
01:33:16,789 --> 01:33:18,882
I would like to leave, sir.

815
01:33:18,958 --> 01:33:21,449
I have someplace
I need to go to right away, please.

816
01:33:23,562 --> 01:33:26,292
You should go back
to where you came from.

817
01:33:26,365 --> 01:33:30,995
Yubaba doesn't want you
in the bathhouse any longer.

818
01:33:31,070 --> 01:33:34,301
Where is your home?
Don't you have any friends or family?

819
01:33:35,708 --> 01:33:38,438
No. No!

820
01:33:38,510 --> 01:33:41,240
I'm lonely.
I'm lonely.

821
01:33:43,415 --> 01:33:45,474
What is it that you want?

822
01:33:45,551 --> 01:33:48,884
I want Sen.
I want Sen!

823
01:33:50,155 --> 01:33:52,146
Take the gold. Take it!

824
01:33:52,224 --> 01:33:54,818
- Are you going to eat me?
- Take it!

825
01:33:54,893 --> 01:33:57,088
Ooh! Huh?

826
01:33:59,031 --> 01:34:01,295
- Huh.
- Ow.

827
01:34:03,836 --> 01:34:06,771
If you want to eat me,
eat this first.

828
01:34:06,839 --> 01:34:09,603
I was saving this for my parents...

829
01:34:09,675 --> 01:34:12,439
but I think you'd better have it.

830
01:34:32,698 --> 01:34:35,758
Sen!

831
01:34:35,834 --> 01:34:38,234
Sen, what did you do to me?

832
01:34:40,506 --> 01:34:42,440
Aah!

833
01:34:54,053 --> 01:34:56,453
Enough! I don't care if he's rich!

834
01:34:57,689 --> 01:35:00,180
This nonsense has gotta stop!

835
01:35:12,704 --> 01:35:14,638
<i>No-Face!</i>

836
01:35:14,706 --> 01:35:17,140
Over here!

837
01:35:24,583 --> 01:35:26,483
Run for your life!

838
01:35:55,380 --> 01:35:57,848
Now, that's an esophagus!

839
01:36:00,285 --> 01:36:03,186
I'll get you for this, Sen!

840
01:36:05,424 --> 01:36:07,415
Duck!

841
01:36:17,402 --> 01:36:19,302
Excuse me.

842
01:36:20,506 --> 01:36:22,440
Sen, this way!

843
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:40,790
Hey, over here!

844
01:36:40,859 --> 01:36:42,793
Sen, don't call him over!

845
01:36:46,398 --> 01:36:49,333
I think being in the bathhouse
makes him crazy.

846
01:36:49,401 --> 01:36:51,335
He needs to get out of there.

847
01:36:51,403 --> 01:36:53,997
- Yeah? And go where?
- I don't know.

848
01:36:54,072 --> 01:36:58,304
You don't know? Great.
Now he's following us.

849
01:36:58,377 --> 01:37:00,311
<i>He won't hurt us.</i>

850
01:37:12,224 --> 01:37:14,988
Hmm?

851
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:17,858
- You'll have to walk from here.
- Okay.

852
01:37:17,930 --> 01:37:20,057
The station's just down the tracks.

853
01:37:20,132 --> 01:37:22,066
Thanks, Rin.

854
01:37:22,134 --> 01:37:26,070
- You better come back, you hear me?
- I will.

855
01:37:29,074 --> 01:37:34,205
Sen, I'm sorry I called you
a dope before! I take it back!

856
01:37:42,387 --> 01:37:46,483
No-Face, if you put even one scratch
on that girl, you're in big trouble.

857
01:37:49,828 --> 01:37:52,388
There's the station.

858
01:38:02,507 --> 01:38:04,498
Here comes the train. Come on.

859
01:38:27,165 --> 01:38:30,862
Oh. We'd like to go
to Swamp Bottom, please.

860
01:38:35,140 --> 01:38:37,472
Huh?

861
01:38:37,542 --> 01:38:40,067
- Oh. You wanna come with us?
- Uh-huh.

862
01:38:40,145 --> 01:38:42,579
He'd like to come too, please.

863
01:39:19,418 --> 01:39:21,648
Uh... Uh...

864
01:39:23,021 --> 01:39:26,616
Sit here. Behave yourself, okay?

865
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:30,941
- Kamajii, wake up.
- Hmm?

866
01:41:32,717 --> 01:41:36,983
- Haku, you're all right.
- I'm fine. Where is Sen?

867
01:41:37,055 --> 01:41:39,956
Did she go somewhere?
Can you tell me what's going on?

868
01:41:40,025 --> 01:41:43,085
You blacked out, remember?

869
01:41:43,161 --> 01:41:45,959
Yeah, I remember being in darkness.

870
01:41:46,031 --> 01:41:49,091
Then I could hear Sen's voice
calling out my name.

871
01:41:49,167 --> 01:41:51,362
So I followed her voice,
and the next thing I knew...

872
01:41:51,436 --> 01:41:53,370
I was lying here
feeling better than ever.

873
01:41:53,438 --> 01:41:57,431
Pure love. It broke Zaneba's spell.

874
01:41:57,509 --> 01:42:00,501
Sen left to return the golden seal.

875
01:42:00,579 --> 01:42:02,774
She did it to save you.

876
01:42:02,848 --> 01:42:06,215
<i>This gold doesn't even come close...</i>

877
01:42:06,284 --> 01:42:09,720
<i>to covering the damage
that stupid No-Face caused.</i>

878
01:42:09,788 --> 01:42:12,621
Sen didn't get nearly enough.
She'll have to be punished.

879
01:42:12,691 --> 01:42:16,889
- Madam, you see, Sen was the one that saved us from No-Face.
- Yes, yes.

880
01:42:16,962 --> 01:42:20,728
So what?
This whole mess is her fault.

881
01:42:20,799 --> 01:42:23,359
And now she's run away from here.

882
01:42:23,435 --> 01:42:25,801
She's even abandoned
her own parents!

883
01:42:25,871 --> 01:42:29,068
<i>Those pigs must be ready to eat by now.</i>

884
01:42:29,140 --> 01:42:32,906
<i>- Turn them into bacon.</i>
- Wait a minute.

885
01:42:32,978 --> 01:42:34,912
- Huh?
- Master Haku?

886
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:39,178
You're still alive?
What is it you want?

887
01:42:39,251 --> 01:42:42,687
You still haven't noticed that something
precious to you has been replaced.

888
01:42:42,754 --> 01:42:46,121
Don't get fresh with me, young man.

889
01:42:46,191 --> 01:42:48,591
Since when do you talk
that way to your master?

890
01:42:57,636 --> 01:43:00,127
Huh.

891
01:43:40,378 --> 01:43:42,608
My baby!

892
01:43:44,516 --> 01:43:47,076
No!

893
01:43:48,987 --> 01:43:50,921
- My baby!
- It's just dirt.

894
01:43:50,989 --> 01:43:54,015
Where's my baby?

895
01:43:54,092 --> 01:43:57,027
Where are you, sweetie?

896
01:43:58,263 --> 01:44:01,164
Come out! Please, come out!

897
01:44:01,232 --> 01:44:03,132
Where are you?

898
01:44:06,071 --> 01:44:09,598
Sweetie!
Sweetie pie!

899
01:44:13,178 --> 01:44:15,408
You!

900
01:44:17,983 --> 01:44:22,477
Where is he?

901
01:44:24,022 --> 01:44:28,584
What did you do with my baby?

902
01:44:28,660 --> 01:44:30,594
He's with your sister.

903
01:44:30,662 --> 01:44:32,687
Zaneba?

904
01:44:36,334 --> 01:44:38,268
Uh...

905
01:44:53,985 --> 01:44:57,182
Very clever, Haku. I get it.

906
01:44:57,255 --> 01:45:00,122
You'll get my baby back for me,
but at a price.

907
01:45:00,191 --> 01:45:03,888
So, what do you want?

908
01:45:03,962 --> 01:45:06,396
Tear up Sen's contract.

909
01:45:06,464 --> 01:45:10,924
And then I want you to return Sen and her mother
and father back to the human world.

910
01:45:11,002 --> 01:45:13,470
Fine, but on one condition.

911
01:45:13,538 --> 01:45:17,474
<i>I get to give Sen one final test.</i>

912
01:45:17,542 --> 01:45:19,442
<i>If she fails, she's mine.</i>

913
01:46:03,388 --> 01:46:06,289
I hope this is the right stop.

914
01:46:07,425 --> 01:46:09,416
Let's go.

915
01:46:35,453 --> 01:46:38,251
You can ride on my shoulder
if you're tired.

916
01:46:45,330 --> 01:46:47,798
Hmm?

917
01:47:55,567 --> 01:47:57,501
<i>Come in.</i>

918
01:48:01,940 --> 01:48:03,965
Hello?

919
01:48:06,311 --> 01:48:08,905
<i>Hurry up. I don't have all day.</i>

920
01:48:08,980 --> 01:48:10,880
Come on.

921
01:48:13,818 --> 01:48:16,616
- So, you all made it.
- Hmm?

922
01:48:16,688 --> 01:48:20,089
Sit down. I'll make some tea.

923
01:48:26,598 --> 01:48:30,329
Excuse me, ma'am. Haku stole this
from you. I came to give it back.

924
01:48:30,401 --> 01:48:33,063
I see.

925
01:48:33,137 --> 01:48:36,072
Do you have any idea what this is?

926
01:48:36,140 --> 01:48:39,371
Yes. It's the golden seal
you were looking for.

927
01:48:39,444 --> 01:48:43,403
I'm here to apologize for Haku.
I'm very sorry.

928
01:48:43,481 --> 01:48:47,349
He sliced me in two, you know,
and I'm still angry.

929
01:48:47,418 --> 01:48:50,945
- What?
- What? The protective spell is gone.

930
01:48:51,022 --> 01:48:55,186
I'm sorry. You mean that black slug
that was on your seal?

931
01:48:55,260 --> 01:48:57,194
I think I squashed it with my foot.

932
01:48:57,262 --> 01:48:59,492
Squashed it?

933
01:49:01,900 --> 01:49:03,993
That wasn't my slug.

934
01:49:04,068 --> 01:49:08,266
My sister put that slug into Haku
so she could control him.

935
01:49:08,339 --> 01:49:11,172
You squashed it.

936
01:49:13,244 --> 01:49:15,542
What happened to my spell?

937
01:49:15,613 --> 01:49:18,343
Only love can break it.
Come, now.

938
01:49:18,416 --> 01:49:23,149
Can you please turn these two
back into their normal forms?

939
01:49:23,221 --> 01:49:26,315
The spell on those two
wore off long ago.

940
01:49:26,391 --> 01:49:29,326
Change back if you want.

941
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:37,891
I don't get along with my sister.

942
01:49:37,969 --> 01:49:40,130
She's so obnoxious.

943
01:49:40,204 --> 01:49:42,536
You saw how tacky her home is.

944
01:49:42,607 --> 01:49:45,667
We're identical twins, yet exact opposites.

945
01:49:49,681 --> 01:49:52,775
I'm sorry she turned
your parents into pigs.

946
01:49:52,850 --> 01:49:56,217
But there's nothing I can do.
It's just the way things are.

947
01:49:56,287 --> 01:49:59,347
You'll have to help your parents
and Haku on your own.

948
01:49:59,424 --> 01:50:01,415
Use what you remember
about them.

949
01:50:01,492 --> 01:50:04,461
What? Can't you please
give me more of a hint than that?

950
01:50:04,529 --> 01:50:08,465
It seems like I met Haku before,
but it was a long time ago.

951
01:50:08,533 --> 01:50:10,467
That's a good start.

952
01:50:10,535 --> 01:50:14,403
Once you've met someone,
you never really forget them.

953
01:50:14,472 --> 01:50:18,067
It just takes a while
for your memories to return.

954
01:50:18,142 --> 01:50:22,169
<i>While you're thinking, the boys
and I are going to make you something.</i>

955
01:50:22,246 --> 01:50:25,443
<i>And I want you
to call me Granny from now on.</i>

956
01:50:28,953 --> 01:50:31,046
<i>Ah, come on. Keep at it.</i>

957
01:50:33,992 --> 01:50:38,929
No-Face, where did you learn to spin thread?
You're really good at this.

958
01:50:38,997 --> 01:50:42,694
<i>Now let's weave
the threads together.</i>

959
01:50:44,035 --> 01:50:46,765
Knit one, pearl two.
Knit one, pearl two.

960
01:50:46,838 --> 01:50:48,772
Knit one... That's right.

961
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:51,968
Granny, I can't remember
anything at all.

962
01:50:52,043 --> 01:50:56,002
Haku could be dead already,
and I'm just sitting around here.

963
01:50:56,080 --> 01:51:00,016
My mom and dad could've been eaten for dinner.

964
01:51:01,486 --> 01:51:03,920
Wait just a little bit longer.

965
01:51:03,988 --> 01:51:05,888
Ahh. There we go.

966
01:51:05,957 --> 01:51:08,790
Use it to tie back your hair.

967
01:51:12,930 --> 01:51:14,864
It's beautiful.

968
01:51:14,932 --> 01:51:17,059
It'll protect you.

969
01:51:17,135 --> 01:51:19,968
It's made from the threads
your friends wove together.

970
01:51:20,038 --> 01:51:21,972
Thank you.

971
01:51:30,848 --> 01:51:33,976
What good timing.
We've got another guest.

972
01:51:34,052 --> 01:51:37,112
- Will you let him in?
- Sure.

973
01:51:48,833 --> 01:51:53,361
Haku! Haku.

974
01:51:53,438 --> 01:51:55,736
Thank goodness.

975
01:51:55,807 --> 01:51:59,402
You're alive! I can't believe it.
How did it happen?

976
01:51:59,477 --> 01:52:01,411
Ahh.

977
01:52:01,479 --> 01:52:03,913
That's love for you.

978
01:52:03,981 --> 01:52:07,280
Look, Granny. Haku's alive.

979
01:52:07,351 --> 01:52:11,310
Haku, I will forgive you for stealing my precious seal.

980
01:52:11,389 --> 01:52:14,825
But in return,
you must take care of this girl.

981
01:52:14,892 --> 01:52:18,453
Okay, you two,
it's time to go home.

982
01:52:18,529 --> 01:52:20,861
Come back soon.

983
01:52:20,932 --> 01:52:23,730
No-Face,
why don't you stay with me?

984
01:52:23,801 --> 01:52:26,827
I could use a good helper.

985
01:52:26,904 --> 01:52:28,838
Granny!

986
01:52:28,906 --> 01:52:31,636
Thank you so much. I'll miss you.

987
01:52:31,709 --> 01:52:35,076
Don't worry. You'll be all right, Sen.

988
01:52:35,146 --> 01:52:38,479
I want you to know my real name.
It's Chihiro.

989
01:52:38,549 --> 01:52:41,040
Chihiro. What a pretty name.

990
01:52:41,119 --> 01:52:43,883
- You take good care of it.
- I will.

991
01:52:43,955 --> 01:52:46,856
- Off you go.
- Okay. Bye.

992
01:52:46,924 --> 01:52:51,384
Granny, take care! Thanks for everything!

993
01:53:38,910 --> 01:53:40,935
Haku, listen.

994
01:53:41,012 --> 01:53:44,846
I just remembered something from a long time ago.
I think it may help you.

995
01:53:44,916 --> 01:53:48,852
<i>Once, when I was little,
I dropped my shoe into a river.</i>

996
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:52,412
And when I tried
to get it back, I fell in.

997
01:53:52,490 --> 01:53:56,085
I thought I'd drown, but the water
carried me to shore.

998
01:53:56,160 --> 01:53:58,754
It finally came back to me.

999
01:53:58,829 --> 01:54:01,923
The river's name was
the Kalaku River.

1000
01:54:01,999 --> 01:54:05,833
<i>I think that was you,
and your real name is Kalaku River!</i>

1001
01:54:26,958 --> 01:54:29,518
You did it, Chihiro! I remember.

1002
01:54:29,594 --> 01:54:31,892
I was the spirit of the Kalaku River.

1003
01:54:31,963 --> 01:54:35,592
- A river spirit?
- My name is the Kalaku River.

1004
01:54:35,666 --> 01:54:38,362
They filled in that river.
It's all apartments now.

1005
01:54:38,436 --> 01:54:41,234
That must be why I can't
find my way home, Chihiro.

1006
01:54:41,305 --> 01:54:44,934
I remember you falling into my river,
and I remember your little pink shoe.

1007
01:54:45,009 --> 01:54:48,172
So you're the one who carried me back
into shallow water.

1008
01:54:48,246 --> 01:54:51,579
You saved me.
I knew you were good.

1009
01:55:24,415 --> 01:55:26,815
Hey, there they are!

1010
01:55:38,596 --> 01:55:42,157
I see you failed
to bring my baby back.

1011
01:55:44,602 --> 01:55:47,002
- Mama!
- My baby!

1012
01:55:47,071 --> 01:55:51,201
Are you traumatized?
Did they do terrible things to you?

1013
01:55:51,275 --> 01:55:54,472
You're standing all by yourself.
When did that happen?

1014
01:55:54,545 --> 01:55:56,979
Don't forget your promise.

1015
01:55:57,048 --> 01:56:00,245
You must return Chihiro
and her parents to the human world.

1016
01:56:00,318 --> 01:56:03,617
Hmph! Not so fast, Haku.

1017
01:56:03,688 --> 01:56:05,849
I get to give Sen one final test.

1018
01:56:05,923 --> 01:56:08,323
Shut up!

1019
01:56:08,392 --> 01:56:10,690
Stop it, Mama. Leave her alone.

1020
01:56:10,761 --> 01:56:14,356
Sen and I had a really good time.

1021
01:56:14,432 --> 01:56:17,333
But a deal is a deal, sweetie.

1022
01:56:17,401 --> 01:56:19,596
I have to give Sen one final test.

1023
01:56:19,670 --> 01:56:23,003
If you make Sen cry,
I won't like you anymore.

1024
01:56:23,074 --> 01:56:27,477
- But... Granny?
<i>- Hey, Granny!</i>

1025
01:56:27,545 --> 01:56:29,945
You're right. A deal's a deal.

1026
01:56:41,325 --> 01:56:43,555
Okay, I'm ready. I'll take your test.

1027
01:56:43,627 --> 01:56:45,561
Hmm. You've got guts.

1028
01:56:45,629 --> 01:56:49,030
I've got your contract right here.
Come this way.

1029
01:56:49,100 --> 01:56:52,035
This'll only take a minute.

1030
01:56:52,103 --> 01:56:54,594
Don't worry.

1031
01:56:57,875 --> 01:57:01,709
See if you can tell which of these pigs
is your mother and father.

1032
01:57:10,955 --> 01:57:12,889
You get one try.

1033
01:57:12,957 --> 01:57:15,357
If you get it right,
you can all go home.

1034
01:57:25,936 --> 01:57:28,700
Huh? There must be a mistake.

1035
01:57:28,773 --> 01:57:30,866
None of these pigs
are my mom or dad.

1036
01:57:30,941 --> 01:57:34,604
None of them?
Is that really your answer?

1037
01:57:36,180 --> 01:57:38,774
Mm-hmm.

1038
01:57:40,184 --> 01:57:43,312
Oh, you got it!

1039
01:57:49,126 --> 01:57:51,287
Thank you, everyone.

1040
01:57:51,362 --> 01:57:54,798
All right, you win.
Get out of my sight.

1041
01:57:54,865 --> 01:57:58,858
Thanks for everything, Granny. Good-bye!

1042
01:57:58,936 --> 01:58:01,871
Good-bye!
- Thank you!

1043
01:58:01,939 --> 01:58:03,930
- Haku!
- Let's go!

1044
01:58:04,008 --> 01:58:07,205
- Where are my mom and dad?
- When you passed the test...

1045
01:58:07,278 --> 01:58:09,303
they woke up
on the human side of the river.

1046
01:58:09,380 --> 01:58:11,814
They're there now,
and they're looking for you.

1047
01:58:11,882 --> 01:58:14,510
There's no water here.

1048
01:58:14,585 --> 01:58:17,816
- I can walk across now.
- But I can't go any farther.

1049
01:58:17,888 --> 01:58:20,254
Just go back the way you came.
You'll be fine.

1050
01:58:20,324 --> 01:58:23,782
But you have to promise not to look back,
not until you've passed through the tunnel.

1051
01:58:23,861 --> 01:58:26,022
What about you? What'll you do?

1052
01:58:26,096 --> 01:58:29,395
Don't worry. I'll go back
and have a talk with Yubaba.

1053
01:58:29,467 --> 01:58:31,958
I'll tell her I'm going
to quit being her apprentice.

1054
01:58:32,036 --> 01:58:34,436
I'm fine. I got my name back.

1055
01:58:34,505 --> 01:58:36,996
- Will we meet again sometime?
- Sure we will.

1056
01:58:37,074 --> 01:58:39,008
- Promise?
- Promise.

1057
01:58:39,076 --> 01:58:40,976
Now go, and don't look back.

1058
01:59:03,467 --> 01:59:05,401
<i>Chihiro!</i>

1059
01:59:05,469 --> 01:59:08,404
Where have you been?
Hurry up!

1060
01:59:11,542 --> 01:59:13,772
<i>Mom, Dad!</i>

1061
01:59:13,844 --> 01:59:17,541
- You shouldn't run off like that, honey.
- You could get in big trouble.

1062
01:59:17,615 --> 01:59:19,981
Are you guys sure you're all right?

1063
01:59:20,050 --> 01:59:22,985
<i>Let's go.
I don't wanna miss the movers.</i>

1064
01:59:33,063 --> 01:59:35,224
Chihiro, hurry up.

1065
01:59:44,041 --> 01:59:46,737
Everybody, watch your step.

1066
01:59:46,810 --> 01:59:49,574
Chihiro, don't cling like that.
You'll make me trip.

1067
02:00:01,992 --> 02:00:04,586
We made it.
Hey, what happened?

1068
02:00:04,662 --> 02:00:06,596
What is it?

1069
02:00:06,664 --> 02:00:08,598
Look at that.

1070
02:00:10,534 --> 02:00:14,470
- It's all dusty inside too.
- Is this someone's idea of a joke?

1071
02:00:14,538 --> 02:00:17,336
<i>- Looks like it.
- I told you we shouldn't have stopped.</i>

1072
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:26,943
<i>Come on, Chihiro.
Let's get to our new home.</i>

1073
02:00:27,017 --> 02:00:29,008
<i>You're not scared, are you?</i>

1074
02:00:29,086 --> 02:00:31,850
<i>Don't be afraid, honey.
Everything's gonna be okay.</i>

1075
02:00:45,269 --> 02:00:49,171
<i>A new home and a new school?
It is a bit scary.</i>

1076
02:00:49,239 --> 02:00:51,469
<i>I think I can handle it.</i>
