<i>They always seem to come when you're
weakest and most in need of their help.</i>

2084
02:13:10,056 --> 02:13:13,310
<i>So I met Jimmy in a crowded place
we both knew.</i>

2085
02:13:13,685 --> 02:13:17,689
<i>I got there 15 minutes early,
and Jimmy was already there.</i>

2086
02:13:18,106 --> 02:13:22,527
<i>He took the booth near the window
so he could see everyone who drove up.</i>

2087
02:13:22,861 --> 02:13:25,238
<i>He wanted to make sure I wasn't tailed.</i>

2088
02:13:25,655 --> 02:13:28,533
<i>He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing.</i>

2089
02:13:29,576 --> 02:13:32,579
<i>On the surface,
everything was supposed to be fine.</i>

2090
02:13:32,746 --> 02:13:35,081
<i>We were supposed to be discussing
my case.</i>

2091
02:13:35,248 --> 02:13:40,212
<i>But I had a feeling Jimmy was trying
to sense if I'd rat on him to save my neck.</i>

2092
02:13:41,880 --> 02:13:45,592
I been telling you your whole life,
don't talk on the phone.

2093
02:13:45,800 --> 02:13:47,594
Now you understand?

2094
02:13:50,263 --> 02:13:53,600
It's going to be okay.
You got a good chance to beat the case.

2095
02:13:56,770 --> 02:14:01,066
You know that kid from the city
we were talking about? You know?

2096
02:14:03,652 --> 02:14:07,656
The kid turned out to be a rat. As soon as
he got pinched, he ratted on everybody.

2097
02:14:10,450 --> 02:14:12,369
I know where he is. He's hiding now.

2098
02:14:14,287 --> 02:14:15,622
Know what I'm saying?

2099
02:14:20,627 --> 02:14:23,797
Would you have a problem going
with Anthony to take care of that?

2100
02:14:24,381 --> 02:14:25,966
Mm-mm.

2101
02:14:26,883 --> 02:14:28,134
No, not at all.

2102
02:14:29,761 --> 02:14:31,346
That way they got nothing.

2103
02:14:40,188 --> 02:14:42,941
<i>HENRY". Jimmy had never asked me
to whack somebody before.</i>

2104
02:14:43,400 --> 02:14:47,070
<i>But now he's asking me to go to Florida
and do a hit with Anthony.</i>

2105
02:14:54,619 --> 02:14:57,956
<i>That's when I knew I would never
have come back from Florida alive.</i>

2106
02:15:12,345 --> 02:15:15,640
Whenever you move me,
I asked once and I'll tell you again...

2107
02:15:15,807 --> 02:15:17,642
I don't want to go any place cold.

2108
02:15:18,643 --> 02:15:20,812
You don't have a choice in that matter.

2109
02:15:21,187 --> 02:15:23,732
Come on. Whoever fucking controls it...

2110
02:15:24,524 --> 02:15:27,193
just no place cold. Do that for me.
I'm trying to--

2111
02:15:27,360 --> 02:15:29,070
He's bronchial, that's why.

2112
02:15:29,237 --> 02:15:31,948
If he's legitimately bronchial,
we'll consider that.

2113
02:15:32,115 --> 02:15:34,200
I'd like to go someplace not cold.

2114
02:15:34,367 --> 02:15:38,079
Can I ask you some questions?
What about my parents?

2115
02:15:39,039 --> 02:15:40,081
What about them?

2116
02:15:40,248 --> 02:15:42,834
Am I going to see them?
Am I going to talk to them?

2117
02:15:44,085 --> 02:15:46,296
Don't I have some kind of contact
with them?

2118
02:15:47,172 --> 02:15:48,214
No.

2119
02:15:49,341 --> 02:15:52,677
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me that...

2120
02:15:53,053 --> 02:15:57,057
God forbid something happens to my
parents, they get sick, I can't see them?

2121
02:15:57,223 --> 02:16:00,226
Maybe something can be worked out
if they're sick...

2122
02:16:00,727 --> 02:16:02,896
if there's extraordinary circumstances--

2123
02:16:03,063 --> 02:16:05,899
I can't do this. I can't do this, Henry.

2124
02:16:07,025 --> 02:16:08,777
I can't leave my parents.

2125
02:16:10,028 --> 02:16:12,238
Excuse me, Karen, I told you before.

2126
02:16:13,490 --> 02:16:16,493
I'm not going to do this
unless you and the kids come with me.

2127
02:16:18,828 --> 02:16:20,497
I can't do it without you.

2128
02:16:20,914 --> 02:16:25,001
So, you do whatever, but...that's it.

2129
02:16:26,544 --> 02:16:29,005
- You need Henry, not me, right?
- That's right.

2130
02:16:29,422 --> 02:16:31,883
Frankly, I don't care
whether you go or not.

2131
02:16:32,217 --> 02:16:35,595
If it'll make him a better witness,
I'd like you to be with him.

2132
02:16:35,762 --> 02:16:37,347
They want Henry, not me.

2133
02:16:37,514 --> 02:16:40,600
Henry'll be in the protection program.
They can't get to him.

2134
02:16:41,518 --> 02:16:44,771
They can only get to him
by getting to you or your kids.

2135
02:16:44,938 --> 02:16:47,524
If he goes into the program,
you're in danger--

2136
02:16:47,691 --> 02:16:50,068
- I don't know anything.
- Don't give me...

2137
02:16:50,235 --> 02:16:51,736
the babe-in-the-woods routine.

2138
02:16:51,903 --> 02:16:56,282
I've listened to those wiretaps,
and I've heard you talk about cocaine.

2139
02:16:56,449 --> 02:16:59,786
<i>Conversation after conversation
you talked to Henry on the phone.</i>

2140
02:17:04,999 --> 02:17:07,085
It doesn't matter.
Whether he goes to jail...

2141
02:17:07,252 --> 02:17:10,547
or stays on the streets and beats the case,
he's a dead man.

2142
02:17:11,297 --> 02:17:13,007
He knows it and you know it.

2143
02:17:14,634 --> 02:17:16,344
What about the kids and school?

2144
02:17:16,511 --> 02:17:18,805
KAREN: <i>Will they get left back?
I mean, what goes on?</i>

2145
02:17:19,139 --> 02:17:21,558
TUDDY:
Go to Wall Street and get real crooks.

2146
02:17:21,725 --> 02:17:24,185
Whoever sold you those suits
had a sense of humor.

2147
02:17:24,352 --> 02:17:27,439
What it comes down to is
we're your only salvation.

2148
02:17:28,273 --> 02:17:31,693
We'll save your life and his life,
and we'll keep you out ofjail.

2149
02:17:35,947 --> 02:17:38,575
<i>This morning you told the jury
about your background.</i>

2150
02:17:38,742 --> 02:17:40,577
<i>HENRY:
It was easy for us to disappear.</i>

2151
02:17:41,119 --> 02:17:43,246
<i>My house
was in my mother-in-law's name.</i>

2152
02:17:43,413 --> 02:17:45,373
<i>My cars were registered to my wife.</i>

2153
02:17:45,540 --> 02:17:49,002
<i>My Social Security cards
and driver's licenses were phonies.</i>

2154
02:17:49,169 --> 02:17:51,504
<i>I never voted or paid taxes.</i>

2155
02:17:52,088 --> 02:17:56,551
<i>My birth certificate and arrest sheet was
all you'd ever have to know I was alive.</i>

2156
02:17:56,718 --> 02:17:58,636
ATTORNEY:
Do you see him here in this courtroom?

2157
02:17:58,803 --> 02:17:59,846
Yes.

2158
02:18:00,013 --> 02:18:02,098
ATTORNEY:
Will you please point him out for the jury?

2159
02:18:04,684 --> 02:18:09,314
Let the record reflect that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant, James Conway.

2160
02:18:10,440 --> 02:18:13,526
Do you also know a man
named Paul Cicero?

2161
02:18:13,860 --> 02:18:15,862
- Do you see him in the courtroom?
- Yes.

2162
02:18:16,446 --> 02:18:18,364
ATTORNEY:
Can you point him out for the jury?

2163
02:18:20,325 --> 02:18:24,412
Let the record reflect that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant, Paul Cicero.

2164
02:18:25,747 --> 02:18:27,457
Your Honor, I have a document...

2165
02:18:27,624 --> 02:18:30,043
<i>HENRY:
The hardest thing was leaving the life.</i>

2166
02:18:30,877 --> 02:18:32,337
<i>I still love the life.</i>

2167
02:18:32,712 --> 02:18:34,631
<i>We were treated like movie stars
with muscle.</i>

2168
02:18:34,798 --> 02:18:37,050
<i>We had it all, just for the asking.</i>

2169
02:18:37,217 --> 02:18:40,553
<i>Our wives, mothers, kids,
everybody rode along.</i>

2170
02:18:40,887 --> 02:18:44,057
<i>I had paper bags filled with jewelry
stashed in the kitchen.</i>

2171
02:18:44,224 --> 02:18:46,476
<i>I had a sugar bowl full of coke
next to the bed.</i>

2172
02:18:46,643 --> 02:18:50,438
People call them rats because rats do
anything to survive. Isn't that right?

2173
02:18:50,605 --> 02:18:52,649
ATTORNEY: Objection!
JUDGE: Objection sustained.

2174
02:18:52,816 --> 02:18:56,402
- I know nothing about being a rat.
- You know everything about it.

2175
02:18:56,736 --> 02:18:58,446
ATTORNEY: Objection, Your Honor.
In view of the violence...

2176
02:18:58,613 --> 02:19:00,740
<i>HENRY:
Anything I wanted was a phone call away.</i>

2177
02:19:00,907 --> 02:19:04,327
<i>Free cars. Keys to a dozen hideout flats
all over the city.</i>

2178
02:19:04,494 --> 02:19:06,996
<i>I'd bet $20,000, $30,000
over a weekend...</i>

2179
02:19:07,163 --> 02:19:11,209
<i>then blow the winnings in a week
or go to the sharks to pay the bookies.</i>

2180
02:19:11,376 --> 02:19:12,710
It didn't matter.

2181
02:19:13,253 --> 02:19:18,132
It didn't mean anything. When I was broke
I would go out and rob some more.

2182
02:19:18,550 --> 02:19:19,926
We ran everything.

2183
02:19:20,468 --> 02:19:24,764
We paid off cops. We paid off lawyers.
We paid offjudges.

2184
02:19:25,014 --> 02:19:28,434
Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.

2185
02:19:30,562 --> 02:19:32,063
And now it's all over.

2186
02:19:32,981 --> 02:19:34,440
<i>That's the hardest part.</i>

2187
02:19:35,441 --> 02:19:37,068
<i>Today everything is different.</i>

2188
02:19:37,235 --> 02:19:41,406
<i>There's no action.
I have to wait around like everyone</i> else.

2189
02:19:41,781 --> 02:19:43,575
<i>Can't even get decent food.</i>

2190
02:19:44,325 --> 02:19:47,453
<i>After I got here I ordered spaghetti
with marinara sauce...</i>

2191
02:19:47,620 --> 02:19:49,455
<i>and I got egg noodles and ketchup.</i>

2192
02:19:50,290 --> 02:19:51,791
<i>I'm an average nobody.</i>

2193
02:19:53,167 --> 02:19:55,962
<i>I get to live the rest of my life
like a schnook.</i>

2194
02:25:20,494 --> 02:25:22,496
